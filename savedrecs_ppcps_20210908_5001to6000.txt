AB Numerous man-made chemicals pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where biological and chemical treatments often result in the formation of a wide range of transformation products via reactions such as conjugation and alkylation. Such transformation products may come into contact with plants when treated wastewater and biosolids are used in agricultural production or when plants are used for mitigation purposes (e.g., treatment wetlands). Using the high-volume antimicrobial triclosan as a model compound, we showed that its primary transformation product in the WWTPs, methyl triclosan, was readily converted back to the parent in plants. Upon exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of methyl triclosan, triclosan was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana cells within 12 h, and the level of triclosan increased over time. The molar fraction of triclosan to methyl triclosan in the cells was estimated to be 0.17 at 144 h. When grown in a nutrient solution containing methyl triclosan, lettuce and carrot seedlings were also capable of transforming methyl triclosan back to triclosan after 4 days, with triclosan levels reaching >10 mu g/g in lettuce tissues and >3 mu g/g in carrot tissues. The back and forth conversions of triclosan in various environmental compartments effectively prolong its environmental persistence and exposure. Future assessment of this and other emerging contaminants should consider such interconversions to obtain a better understanding of their fate and risks.

AB To evaluate the performance of zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 composite catalysts toward target pollutants under solar light irradiation, the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of 18 pharmaceuticals and pesticides with distinguishing features (molecular size and volume, and photolysis) were investigated using mordenite zeolites with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 18 and 240. Different quantities of carbon-doped TiO2 were coated on the zeolites, and then the finished composite catalysts were tested in demineralized, surface, and hospital wastewater samples, respectively. The composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and surface area and porosity analyses. Results showed that a dispersed layer of carbon-doped TiO2 is formed on the zeolite surface; this layer blocks the micropores of zeolites and reduces their surface area. However, these reductions did not significantly affect adsorption onto the zeolites. Our results demonstrated that zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 systems can effectively degrade 18 pharmaceuticals and pesticides in demineralized water under natural and simulated solar light irradiation. In surface and hospital wastewaters, zeolite-supported carbon-doped TiO2 systems present excellent anti-interference capability against radical scavengers and competitive organics for pollutants removal, and higher pollutants adsorption on zeolites evidently enhances the removal rate of target pollutants in surface and hospital wastewater samples with a complicated matrix.

AB This study presents the extraction of antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) from aqueous solution employing activated carbons (AC) from olive biomass (OB). Two AC were prepared using ZnCl2(activator agent), and a conventional muffle furnace (ACF) or microwave oven (ACMW). The structure, morphology, and textural properties from both AC were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), pH of point-zero-charge (pH(PZC)), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and N(2)adsorption/desorption isotherms. AC with mesoporous structures rich in oxygenated groups and high specific area (as high as 1742 m(2)g(-1)) were helpful for the efficient and fast adsorption of AMX. The Avrami kinetic nonlinear equation showed the best fitting for the empirical data when related to the pseudo-1st and pseudo-2nd order. The isothermal experimental data followed the Liu nonlinear model, displaying at 25 degrees C the maximum sorption capacity of 237.02 and 166.96 mg g(-1)for the ACF and ACMW, respectively. An adsorption test with synthetic hospital effluent was carried out to evaluate the possibility of applying both adsorbents in wastewater purification. The purification efficiency was up to 94.4% and 91.96% for ACF and ACMW, respectively. Therefore, the AC obtained from OB (containing a mixture of seed, pulp, and olive peel) has a high potential for application in removing emerging contaminants from the wastewater.

AB Effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was treated on-site with the UV/chlorine (UV/HOCl) advanced oxidation process (AOP) using a pilot plant equipped with a medium pressure UV lamp with an adjustable performance of up to 1 kW. Results obtained from parallel experiments with the same pilot plant, where the state of the art UV/H2O2 AOP was applied, were compared regarding the removal of emerging contaminants (EC) and the formation of adsorbable organohalogens (AOX). Furthermore, the total estrogenic activity was measured in samples treated with the UV/chlorine AOP. At an energy consumption of 0.4 kWh/m(3) (0.4 kW, 1 m(3)/h) and in a range of oxidant concentrations from 1 to 6 mg/L, the UV/chlorine AOP had a significantly higher EC removal yield than the UV/H2O2 AOP. With free available chlorine concentrations (FAC) in the UV chamber influent of at least 5 mg/L (11 mg/L of dosed Cl-2), the total estrogenic activity could be reduced by at least 97%. To achieve a certain concentration of FAC in the UV chamber influent, double to triple the amount of dosed Cl-2 was needed, resulting in AOX concentrations of up to 520 mu g/L.

AB Iodinated pharmaceuticals, thyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and diatrizoate (an iodinated X-ray contrast medium), are among the most prescribed active pharmaceutical ingredients. Both of them have been reported to potentially disrupt thyroid homeostasis even at very low concentrations. In this study, UV 254 nm-based photolysis and photochemical processes, i.e., UV only, UV/H2O2, and UV/S2O82-, were evaluated for the destruction of these two pharmaceuticals. Approximately 40% of 0.5 mu M thyroxine or diatrizoate was degraded through direct photolysis at UV fluence of 160 mJ cm(-2), probably resulting from the photosensitive cleavage of C-I bonds. While the addition of H2O2 only accelerated the degradation efficiency to a low degree, the destruction rates of both chemicals were significantly enhanced in the UV/S2O82- system, suggesting the potential vulnerability of the iodinated chemicals toward UV/S2O82- treatment. Such efficient destruction also occurred in the presence of radical scavengers when biologically treated wastewater samples were used as reaction matrices. The effects of initial oxidant concentrations,solution pH, as well as the presence of natural organic matter (humic acid or fulvic acid) and alkalinity were also investigated in this study. These results provide insights for the removal of iodinated pharmaceuticals in water and/or wastewater using UV-based photochemical processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we prepared two types of composite membranes decorated with CoCu layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles, i.e. LDH@Calotropis gigantean fiber (LDH@CGF) and LDH@polyvinylidene fluoride (LDH@PVDF) for the first time. Besides, the application potential of different types of composite functional membranes based on LDH in PMS activation system was compared. Both of the LDH-based composite membranes exhibited excellent activity in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation process. More importantly, the composite membrane could be separated from the treated water to meet the need of practical application. The superior composite membrane was identified as LDH@PVDF, which was with excellent PMS activation capability and pretty lower metal ions leaching concentration (cobalt 0.044 mg L-1, copper 0.026 mg L-1). And then, LDH@PVDF was employed to investigate the PMS activation performance in various pharmaceutical pollutants removal processes. Besides, the activity of LDH@PVDF for SMX degradation in real aquatic environment (tap water and wastewater) was detected, proving the wide practical applicability of LDH@PVDF membrane. Finally, the possible SMX degradation pathway and PMS activation mechanism occurring in LDH-based composite membrane/PMS system were proposed. Hence, this study for LDH-based membranes construction may provide new insights into the environmentally-friendly catalytic membranes preparation and practical application in wastewater treatment.

AB Simulated pharmaceutical wastewaterwas treated bymoving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and total reflux sludge reactor process (STR) system. By cultivating specific bacterial groups, optimizing reactor process parameters, and comparatively analyzing the pollutant removal efficiency under stable operating conditions of the system, the treatment efficiency of the two systems under the combined impact load of organic pollutants on the target pollutants indole and naphthalene was studied. The optimal operation parameters of reactors: hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 8 h, aeration was 0.12 m(3)/h. The effect was better in 25 +/- 1 degrees C than that in 20 +/- 2 degrees C. During stable operation, the average removal rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) of the MBBR system was significantly higher than that of STR, and the two kinds of target pollutants concentration in water was lower than the detection limit. In the combined impact test of organic pollutants, the dominant bacterial group obtained by domestication had a high degradation ability, so the combined impact of indole and naphthalene had little effect on the two reactors. But in the fourth stage, the residual naphthalene concentration in the STR system effluent exceeded the target value. Therefore, the MBBR process has a stronger treatment effect on pharmaceuticalwastewater than the STR systemduring the stable period and the impact load stage. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Public concerns about potential ecological risks of androgens discharged to the environment through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has resulted in an increased interest regarding the occurrence and fate of androgens in WWTPs. In this study, the occurrence and removal of eight androgens from 12 municipal WWTPs distributed in eleven cities in China were investigated. The composition profiles of eight androgens in influent, effluent, and excess sludge were studied. Multiple factor analyses were performed to reveal the factors affecting the distribution of androgens in WWTP influent. Results showed similar composition profiles of androgens in the studied WWTPs, with androsterone and dehydroepi-androsterone confirmed as the dominant androgens. The distributions of androgens in WWTP influent were related to the chemical oxygen demand in influent and the gross domestic product (GDP) of WWTP-associated cities. The target androgens have high aqueous removal rates, with a mean removal rate of >90%. Additionally, the behaviors of androgens were evaluated by mass balance along anaerobicanoxic-oxic (MO) processes in a WWTP, in which many of the androgens were eliminated mainly in the anaerobic tank. Further, 15 biotransformation products of testosterone were identified under anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic sludge, respectively. Based on these metabolites, a general biotransformation pathway of testosterone under anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic sludge is presented. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The combination of chemical and biological treatment is a promising solution to remove emerging contaminants, e.g., pharmaceuticals, from wastewater for its future reuse. In this study, the combination of ozonation and ultrasound (O-3/US) was examined as a pretreatment prior to membrane bioreactor (MBR). The effects of O-3/US on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals, including diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and carbamazepine (CBZ), and MBR fouling control were investigated. The variation of the toxicity potential of the MBR influent was also assessed. The O-3/US treatment was effective in reducing fouling, mainly due to its effects on the microbial metabolism products in the MBR. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) concentration was reduced by 50%. Improved operating conditions resulted in higher removal rates for pharmaceuticals in the MBR effluent, with removal efficiency in the range of 80-84%. However, the O-3/US treatment alone was not efficient in removing the toxicity of wastewater. This was likely due to the formation of intermediate products that are more toxic than the parent compounds. These intermediate products were observed to be biologically oxidized by MBR, with a 80% reduction of the toxicity potential in the MBR permeate compared to the influent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the kinetics of the different mechanisms (radical pathway, photolysis, molecular reaction with H2O2 and reaction with ultrasonically generated oxidative species) involved in the homogeneous sono-photoFenton (US/UV/H2O2/Fe) mineralization of antipyrine present in a synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (ASMWE). The dynamic behavior of hydroxyl (HO center dot) radical generation and consumption in mineralization reaction under different systems was investigated by measuring hydroxyl radical concentration during the reaction. The overall mineralization process was optimized using a Central-Composite Experimental Design (CCED) with four variables (initial concentrations of H2O2 and Fe(II), amplitude and pulse length). The response functions (pseudo-first order mineralization kinetic rate constants) were fitted using neural networks (NNs). Under the optimal conditions ([H2O2]0 = 500 mg L-1, [Fe(II)](0), = 27 mg L-1, Amplitude (%) = 20 and Pulse length = 1), the TOC removal was 79% in 50 min. The radical reaction in the bulk solution was found be the primary mineralization pathway (94.8%), followed by photolysis (3.65%), direct reaction with H2O2 (0.86%), and reaction by ultrasonically generated oxidative species (0.64%). The role of the Fe catalyst on the radical reaction and the presence of refractory intermediates towards hydroxyl radical were also studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozone process control in secondary effluent used for elimination of trace organic compounds (TrOCs) requires the use of surrogates, such as the relative reduction of UV absorption at 254 nm (Delta UVA(254)) to adapt the ozone dose to a varying water quality. In the present study, a closed-loop process control based on two online UVA(254) measurements was successfully implemented and tested under realistic conditions with ozone doses from 0.2 to 1.05 mg-O-3/mg-DOC at a pilot scale ozonation system with subsequent coagulation filtration at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (DOC similar to 13 mg/L, UVA(254) similar to 27 m(-1), and nitrite peaks of up to 1.6 mg-N/L). It could be shown that measuring the UVA(254) at the ozonation effluent was superior to the measurement of UVA(254) at the filter effluent in terms of response time due to changes in water quality, whereas online measurement at the filter effluent showed a better agreement with laboratory data and a reduced maintenance interval due to less particles. Additional online nitrite measurement is not necessary as the ozone consumption by nitrite directly impacts Delta UVA(254). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the performance of forward osmosis (FO) in treating the high-salinity feed waters containing heavy metal Ni2+ with different salinities was investigated using two different FO membranes (cellulose triacetate (CTA) and polyamide-based thin-film composite (TFC) membrane). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were selected to analyze the used membrane. The result showed that, heavy metals Ni2+ stimulated the formation of CP, and then decreased the water flux. However, this effect decreased with the increase of FS salinity and membrane hydrophilicity. Due to the amphiprotic characteristics, SDBS promoted the water permeation by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The effect of SDBS on CTA-FO membrane was greater than TFC-FO membrane for that CTA-FO membrane was weakly hydrophilic. However, the role decreased with the salinity increasing. Ni2+ removal efficiencies were more than 93%. Specifically, TFC-FO membrane was higher than CTA-FO membrane in high-salinity wastewater, and the FO mode maintained an advantage over the PRO mode. SDBS enhanced Ni2+ removal efficiency greatly at low salinity, and decreased it instead at high salinity. The SEM-EDS analysis supplied the technique support and reflected the role of Ni2+ and SDBS in the membrane directly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption plays a significant role in removing hydrophobic 17-estradiol (E2) from wastewater. Batch experiments were conducted to compare the adsorption of E2 onto activated aerobic granular sludge (AGS) and activated sludge (AS), and features evaluated included the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and influence of other environmental factors. By using a non-chemical wet-heat technique, both AGS and AS were treated to inactivated status. Then, after loading E2, the adsorption equilibrium capacity of the AGS was found to be greater than that of the AS at the same initial concentration of E2. Moreover, both the adsorption processes corresponded to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model; the adsorption rate constant of AGS was found to be higher and the half-adsorption time was shorter than that of AS. Next, evaluations of adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics indicated that the adsorption process was mainly a physical process. Lower temperatures facilitated a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity. However, the adsorption binding sites of AGS were distributed more uniformly at higher temperature, in contrast to the distribution found for AS. Finally, acidic conditions and an appropriate ionic strength (0.4mol/L) were found to be particularly conducive to the adsorption process. Overall, the results showed that AGS has the potential to adsorb E2 with significant efficiency, thereby offering a new and more efficient means of treating E2 and trace oestrogens in wastewater.

AB The hyporheic zone - a spatially fluctuating ecotone connecting surface water and groundwater - is considered to be highly reactive with regard to the attenuation of organic micropollutants. In the course of the presented study an undisturbed sediment core was taken from the infiltration zone of a bank filtration site in Berlin and operated under controlled laboratory conditions with wastewater-influenced surface water at two different temperatures, simulating winter and summer conditions. The aim was to evaluate the fate of site-relevant micropollutants, namely metoprolol, iopromide, diclofenac, carbamazepine, acesulfame, tolyltriazole, benzotriazole, phenazone and two phenazone type metabolites, within the first meter of infiltration dependent on the prevailing temperature. A change in temperature resulted in a development of significantly distinct redox conditions. Both temperature dependencies and related redox dependencies were identified for all micropollutants except for benzotriazole and carbamazepine, which behaved persistent under all conditions. For the remaining compounds degradation rate constants generally decreased from warm and oxic/penoxic/suboxic over cold and oxic/penoxic to warm and manganese reducing (transition zone). Individual degradation rate constants ranged from 0 (e.g. diclofenac, acesulfame and tolyltriazole in the transition zone) to 1.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) for metoprolol under warm conditions within the oxic to suboxic zone.

AB This study aimed at investigating the reactivity of aniline-based pharmaceuticals with sulfate radical anion generated by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)/Cobalt(II) system and by taking sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac as probe compounds. Transformation pathways were proposed for both pharmaceuticals relying on the identification of the main reaction intermediate products using liquid chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry. For diclofenac, the major transformation pathway led to the formation of a quinone imine derivative while for sulfamethoxazole a nitro derivative was obtained as the major intermediate. However, in both cases, oxidative reactions started with the formation of a N-centered radical probably through an one-electron transfer from the pharmaceutical to sulfate radical anion. This was followed by further multistep degradation involving decarboxylation, hydroxylation and bond cleavage reactions in route to mineralization. From a kinetic point of view, aniline-based pharmaceuticals quickly reacted with sulfate radical anion with second order kinetic rate constants in the 9-10 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) Sulfate radical-based technologies show promising results for the removal of these particular pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant effluents mainly because of the higher selectivity of sulfate radical anion over hydroxyl radical, limiting radical scavenging by natural organic matter and allowing for higher abatement and mineralization rates.

AB Incorporation of graphene/graphene oxide on a low-cost support has been established to improve adsorption performance. This study reports the synthesis of silica nanotubes (SNT) from elephant grass, its encapsulation by reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/graphene oxide (GO) and its application as a highly efficient adsorbent for the remediation of sulfamethoxazole from wastewater. The SNT was synthesized and encapsulated with GO and RGO, to obtain silica nanotubes graphene oxide (SNTGO) and silica nanotubes reduced graphene oxide (SNTG), respectively. The adsorbents were characterized with FTIR, CHN elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, XRD, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The FTIR, elemental analysis, and XRD results confirmed successful synthesis of the materials. SNTGO had an adsorption capacity of 125 mg/g, which increased to 248 mg/g when it was reduced to SNTG in the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole. The pseudo-second-order model best described the adsorption kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm was best fit for the equilibrium data. Thermodynamic studies showed the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. The desorption studies revealed that the adsorbent could be regenerated and reused in the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole. SNTG was a better adsorbent compared to SNTGO for wastewater remediation.

AB This paper describes the fate of a nitrobenzene-degrading bacterium, Klebsiella oxytoca NBA-1, which was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment facility. The 90-day survivability of strain NBA-1 after exposure to sludge under anaerobic and aerobic conditions was investigated. The bacterium was inoculated into sludge amended with glucose and p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) to compare the bacterial community variations between the modified sludge and nitrobenzene amendment. The results showed that glucose had no obvious effect on nitrobenzene biodegradation in the co-metabolism process, regardless of the presence/absence of oxygen. When p-CNB was added under anaerobic conditions, the biodegradation rate of nitrobenzene remained unchanged although p-CNB inhibited the production of aniline. The diversity of the microbial community increased and NBA-1 continued to be one of the dominant strains. Under aerobic conditions, the degradation rate of both nitrobenzene and p-CNB was only 20% of that under anaerobic conditions. p-CNB had a toxic effect on the microorganisms in the sludge so that most of the DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) bands, including that of NBA-1, began to disappear under aerobic conditions after 90 days of exposure. These data show that the bacterial community was stable under anaerobic conditions and the microorganisms, including NBA-1, were more resistant to the adverse environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of antibiotics and their metabolites such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) in water resources attracted notable attention as a new international health concern. A systematic and review-meta analysis was performed to evaluate the concentration of CIP in the rivers along with the related ecological risk assessment. PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases were screened to retrieve the related articles among 1 January 1983 to 10 July 2018. Fifty-five articles (58 studies of data reports) comprising 1,886 samples from 20 countries were included. Furthermore, the meta-analysis was performed by the aid of a random effects model (REM) to estimate pooled concentration with 95% confidence intervals (CI). According to findings, the concentration of CIP in the river downstream of untreated wastewater was higher than other rivers located downstream of treated wastewater. Also, the meta-analysis of data based on year of study subgroup demonstrated that over time, the concentration of CIP in the rivers was increased. The ecological risk assessment showed that people settled in some regions of South Africa was at a potential (HQ: 1-10 value) adverse ecological risk of CIP in the river. Therefore immediate control plans besides appropriate removal techniques should be approached for complete eradication of antibiotics like CIP.

AB This study examines time-varying adsorption of aqueous tetracycline (TC) by metal-organic framework, MOF-5. The employed MOF-5 is firstly synthesized under room temperature condition. Its structural, chemical, and physical features are then determined applying FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA, N-2 adsorption, and TEM characterization techniques. Cubic arrangement, 84.3% crystallinity, up to 450 degrees C thermal stability and approximately 2510 m(2)/g BET surface area with the both micro- and meso-cavities are its revealed characteristics. The impacts of the operative factors (adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial TC concentration, initial pH and temperature) on TC removal efficiency are examined following a two-step experimental design procedure (two-level categorical screening followed by response surface methodology for correlative model development). Additionally, to define the most appropriate condition/conditions, model-based optimization is implemented and verified in practice (more than %96 TC removal is achieved). Further thermodynamic and kinetic assessments respectively signify the both physisorption (Langmuir adsorption isotherm with maximum capacity of 233 mg/g) and chemisorption (pseudo-second-order model) mechanisms in this adsorption system. To sum up, MOF-5 as a suitable adsorbing agent will possibly have significant effects on pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and can be considered for advanced studies as an appropriate candidate regarding practicable remediation techniques.

AB Researching and industrializing a new pharmaceutical form results in an impressive amount of waste due to the methods used. Despite numerous reports about the addition of pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment, the effect they have on the environment at the nanogram (ng) level remains largely unknown; thus, it has been proposed to retain toxic compounds using Dowex resins in biomucoadhesive tablets containing miconazole nitrate, an antifungal medication. This study demonstrates the reduction of water pollution by using pharmaceutical forms of miconazol nitrate anions; at the same time, the proposed method can also re-utilize the anti-fungal substances by recovering them from the ion-changing resins. The pollutant examined in the study was nitrate anions, and the resin was represented by DowexTMNSR-1. Once the pharmaceutical form was disaggregated in distilled water and the resulting solution was filtered through the Dowex resin, chemical test reports were created, and all the parameters had registered values below the allowable wastewater limits. Through the ionic exchange method in this study, up to 99.8% of the anion nitrate ended up as waste during the preparation of new pharmaceutical forms while the antifungal effect was retained. This anion nitrate percentage was confirmed through 10 different determinations of 309 biomucoadhesive miconazol nitrate tablets disaggregated into 1000 mL of distilled water.

AB Atenolol is a beta-blocker that can be found in urban wastewaters and which is not removed efficiently by conventional wastewater treatments. In the present study, electro-Fenton (EF) process was used to assess the degradation and mineralization of pharmaceutical atenolol in aqueous solutions. Electrolyses of 250 mL of atenolol solution (0.17 mM), at initial pH 3, were carried out in an undivided electrolytic cell in galvanostatic mode. Influence of material cathode (graphite, stainless steel, and platinized titanium), applied current (100-500 mA), sulfate dosage (0.01-0.5 M), and catalyst ferrous ions concentration (1-10 mM), on the oxidation efficiency was studied. Atenolol mineralization was monitored by COD dosage. Kinetic analysis indicated that atenolol mineralization followed a pseudo-first order model and the rate constant increased with rising current, ferrous ions concentration (up to 5 mM) and electrolyte concentration. Results showed that graphite cathode, 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, 0.3 A and 5 mM FeSO4 catalyst were the best conditions for atenolol mineralization. In these optimal conditions, after 240 min more than 87% of the initial COD was removed. The corresponding current efficiency (CE) and specific energy consumption (SEC) were 22.33% and 0.194 kWh/kg COD, respectively. This latter corresponds to 0.078 kWh/m(3) of treated wastewater.

AB The effect of inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the TiO2 photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants was investigated. The presence of HPO42-, NH4+, and HCO3- resulted in a significantly negative impact on the photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from synthetic water due to their strong adsorption on the surface of TiO2. However, only a weak impact was noted during photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluent with these ions added, since the presence of DOM in real wastewater played a more important role in inhibiting photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity than inorganic ions. By investigating the effect of different DOM fractions on photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity, polar compounds (PC) were found to cause a temporary increase in estrogenic activity during TiO2 photocatalysis. Fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular weight (MW) analysis on secondary effluent spiked with PC during TiO2 photocatalysis suggest that large MW organic matter (>4.5 kDa) in secondary effluent, such as humic/fulvic acid, not only could play an important role in inhibiting photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity but also is responsible for the temporary increase in estrogenic activity during the same process.

AB The paper mainly focused on illustrating the merit of respirometric analysis in assessing the inhibitory/toxic impact of xenobiotics on substrate biodegradation. It also evaluated biodegradation characteristics of these chemicals at continuous exposure through acclimation of the microbial culture. The nature and role of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) profiles were discussed in conjunction with appropriate modelling, which should incorporate dissolved oxygen as an indispensable component for respirometric evaluation. Emphasis was placed upon differentiating acute effects from chronic impact, which may be totally different as it involves biodegradation of the chemical due biomass acclimation. Three case studies, each involving OUR measurements and process modelling, were presented for this purpose. The first one related to the inhibitory action of pharmaceutical effluent when mixed with plain-settled tannery wastewater. The second investigated the fate of H-acid, a commercially important naphthalene sulfonate, which exerted no adverse effect on substrate biodegradation, while remaining intact before and after a long acclimation period. The third one involved 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a naturally occurring organic compound in olive oil wastewater, which became biodegradable after acclimation by the development of a specific microbial biomass fraction, while it heavily inhibited substrate biodegradation at first exposure. Model evaluation of the experimental data could provide related information on process stoichiometry and kinetics in all studies.

AB Internal concentrations link external exposure to the potential effect, as they reflect what the organisms actually take up and experience physiologically. In this study, we investigated whether frequently detected risk-driving substances in water were found in the exposed organisms and if they are classified the same based on the whole body internal concentrations. Field gammarids were collected upstream and downstream of ten wastewater treatment plants in mixed land use catchments. The sampling was conducted in autumn and winter, during low flow conditions when diffuse agricultural input was reduced. The field study was complemented with laboratory and flume experiments to determine the bioaccumulation potentials of selected substances. For 32 substances, apparent bioaccumulation factors in gammarids were determined for the first time. With a sensitive multiresidue method based on online-solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, we detected 63 (semi-) polar organic substances in the field gammarids, showing higher concentrations downstream than upstream. Interestingly, neonicotinoids, which are particularly toxic toward invertebrates, were frequently detected and were further determined as major contributors to the toxic pressure based on the toxic unit approach integrating internal concentration and toxic potency. The total toxic pressure based on internal concentrations was substantially higher compared to when external concentrations were used. Thus, internal concentrations may add more value to the current environmental risk assessment that is typically based solely on external exposure.

AB The 2009-2010 influenza pandemic saw many people treated with antivirals and antibiotics. High proportions of both classes of drugs are excreted and enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in biologically active forms. To date, there has been no study into the potential for influenza pandemic-scale pharmaceutical use to disrupt WWTP function. Furthermore, there is currently little indication as to whether WWTP microbial consortia can degrade antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors when exposed to pandemic-scale doses. In this study, we exposed an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor, operated for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), to a simulated influenza-pandemic dosing of antibiotics and antivirals for 8 weeks. We monitored the removal of the active form of Tamiflu (R), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), bacterial community structure, granule structure and changes in EBPR and nitrification performance. There was little removal of OC by sludge and no evidence that the activated sludge community adapted to degrade OC. There was evidence of changes to the bacterial community structure and disruption to EBPR and nitrification during and after high-OC dosing. This work highlights the potential for the antiviral contamination of receiving waters and indicates the risk of destabilizing WWTP microbial consortia as a result of high concentrations of bioactive pharmaceuticals during an influenza pandemic.

AB Kinetic evaluation of an acidogenic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated. For kinetic modeling of the acidogenic reactor (Monod, Contois, Grau, et al.), first-order kinetic models were used. These models have high correlation coefficients in this study. Monod models have shown high correlation coefficients (99%) which were used in describing the process kinetics of the anaerobic acidogenic reactor. Kinetic studies showed that sludge yield (Y) and decay rate (Kd) were 0.25 mg VSS/mg COD and 0.79 1/day, respectively.

AB Benzodiazepine derivatives are prescribed in large quantities globally and are potentially new emerging environmental contaminants. Unfortunately, a dearth of data exists concerning occurrence, persistence and fate in the environment. This paper redresses this by reviewing existing literature, assessing the occurrence of selected benzodiazepine anxiolytics (diazepam, oxazepam and bromazepam) in wastewater influent and effluent and surface water from Slovenia, evaluating their removal during water treatment and identifying the transformation products formed during water treatment. Their occurrence was monitored in hospital effluent, river water and in wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent. The study reveals the presence of benzodiazepine derivatives in all samples with the highest amounts in hospital effluents: 111 ngL(-1), 158 ngL(-1) and 72 ng L-1 for diazepam, bromazepam and oxazepam, respectively. Removal efficiencies with respect to biological treatment of diazepam were 16-18% (oxic), 18-32% (anoxic -> oxic), 53-76% (oxic -> anoxic) and 83% (oxic -> anoxic -> oxic -> anoxic cascade bioreactors), while the removal oxazepam was 20-24% under anoxic conditions. Coupled biological and photochemical treatment followed by the adsorption to activated carbon resulted in a removal efficiency of 99.99%. Results reveal the recalcitrant nature of benzodiazepine derivatives and suggest that only combinational treatment is sufficient to remove them. In addition, eight novel diazepam and four novel oxazepam transformation products are reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two aerobic granular sludge (AGS) sequential batch reactors were operated at a mild (15 degrees C) temperature for 180 days. One of those bioreactors was exposed to a mixture of diclofenac, naproxen, trimethoprim, and carbamazepine. The AGS system, operating under pressure from emerging contaminants, showed a decrease in COD, BOD5, and TN removal capacity, mainly observed during the first 100 days, in comparison with the removal ratios detected in the control bioreactor. After an acclimatisation period, the removal reached high-quality effluent for COD and TN, close to 95% and 90%, respectively. In the steady-state period, trimethoprim and diclofenac were successfully removed with values around 50%, while carbamazepine and naproxen were more recalcitrant. The dominant bacterial OTUs were affected by the presence of a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds, under which the dominant phylotypes changed to OTUs classified among the Pseudomonas, Gemmobacter, and Comamonadaceae. The RT-qPCR and qPCR results showed the deep effects of pharmaceutical compounds on the number of copies of target genes. Statistical analyses allowed for linking the total and active microbial communities with the physico-chemical performance, describing the effects of pharmaceutical compounds in pollution degradation, as well as the successful adaptation of the system to treat wastewater in the presence of toxic compounds.

AB Industrial waste containing dye poses a threat to the ecosystem and human as well as aquatic life. Methylene blue (MB, a cationic dye) has been used in excess amounts in textile, pulp and paper, rubber, plastics, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and food industries. MB dye released in water sources makes the water toxic in nature. So, to remove the dye from wastewater various methods (physical, chemical and biological) are adopted for treatment purposes. Among them, adsorption is found to be more economical and eco-friendlier in comparison to others. Various adsorbents reported have been the literature for the removal of MB dye such as wheat straw, rice husk, cashew nut shell, sawdust, wood, pine needles, green grass, eucalyptus bark, peanut shell, coconut shell, coir dust, etc.
   In this experimental study, Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. (AER) is utilised for the treatment of MB dye from the wastewater in continuous mode by varying the different parameters viz., bed height, flow rate, and the initial concentration of MB dye. Yoon-Nelson and Clark's models have been applied to predict the break through curve and to find out the characteristic parameters of column suitable for process design. The study reported that Clark's model was found to be fit for the breakthrough curve. The findings revealed that Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. has a high adsorption potential, and it could be used to treat dye-containing effluents.

AB Ultraviolet radiation (UV)-activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) advanced oxidation processes were examined for their capacity to remove nine pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from secondary effluent. The effect of operational parameters (initial oxidant concentration, UV exposure time, pH, common coexisting anions and effluent organic matter (EfOM)) on UV/PDS and UV/PMS treatment efficiency was investigated in a collimated beam device housing a low-pressure mercury UV lamp emitting light at 253.7 nm.
   Both AOPs achieved high removals ( > 90%) when applied to pure water. Under otherwise similar conditions the removal percentage fell by 20-30% due to the scavenging of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in secondary effluent. Finally, eliminating EfOM but maintaining the inorganic composition, the radical scavenging effect was reduced and 98.3% and 85.6% average removals were obtained by UV/PDS and UV/PMS, respectively.
   Increasing pH improved degradation of several PhACs containing amine groups. Higher oxidant dosages created only a significant benefit in UV/PDS. The chloride anion produced a negligible effect on both processes, while higher nitrate concentrations increased removal percentage but did not affect degradation rate constants. Finally and surprisingly, the addition of bicarbonate had the strongest positive impact on the degradation kinetics observed, even stronger than the elimination of EfOM from secondary effluent.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical and personal care products increases their concentrations in the wastewater entering treatment plants and their levels into biological reactors. The most extended biological wastewater treatment is the activated sludge process. The toxicity of ibuprofen and triclosan, individually and combined, was studied by tracking the biological activity of the activated sludge measuring oxygen uptake rate and the inhibition of the esterase activity. Short-term exposure produced significant inhibition in oxygen uptake, with lower damage to enzymatic activity. Median effect values for oxygen uptake inhibition were 64 +/- 13 mg L-1 and 0.32 +/- 0.07 mg L-1 for ibuprofen and triclosan respectively using 125 mg L-1 activated sludge. For the inhibition of enzymatic activity values were 633 +/- 63 mg L-1 for ibuprofen and 1.94 0.32 mg L-1 for triclosan. Results indicated that oxygen uptake, related to primary activity of microorganisms, was more strongly affected than the enzymatic activity associated to energy consumption. Toxicity interactions were determined using the Combination Index-isobologram method. Results showed antagonism at lower values of affected population, after which the mixtures tended to additivity and synergism. For the case of enzymatic activity, the antagonism was less marked and the additivity range was higher. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the recent years, residual antibiotics are considered to be emerging environmental pollutants due to their continuous input and persistence into the aquatic ecosystem even at low concentrations. Therefore, these are necessary to develop efficient methods for the wastewater treatment. The present paper describes the efficiency of several types of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for the retention of the selected antibiotics (ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, piperacillin, tazobactam, tetracycline, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and thrimetoprim) from aqueous (synthetic) solutions and wastewater samples. The functionalized MWCNTs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained antibiotic percentage of retention was evaluated by quantitative assessment using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with the diode array, fluorescence, and mass spectrometer detector (HPLC-DAD/FD/MS), after the solid-phase extraction (SPE) with Oasis HLB cartridges. The retention percentages of the selected antibiotics from waters ranged between similar to 40 and 97%, with the exception of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The best percentages of retention were obtained for norfloxacin 97.03% and ciprofloxacin 97.10%. The suspensions of the MWCNTs improved the antibiotics removal from wastewaters. Removal of antibiotics from wastewaters using nanotechnology, in order to reduce their negative effects and antibiotic resistance, is a promising tool in the future wastewaters treatment.

AB Diclofenac (DIC) is a new type of contaminant that has been widely detected in the water environment, posing threats to the ecological environment and human health. However, the conventional wastewater treatment process has a very limited ability to reduce DIC. In this research, persulfate is added to electro-Fenton with the three-dimensional particle electrode (TDE) process whose particle electrodes were formed from manganese slag with loaded active substance (Cu: Fe = 1:1) to construct a three-dimensional electro-Fenton-persulfate (3D electro-Fenton-PS) process to investigate the removal rate of DIC under the optimum working conditions. The effects of different persulfate addition, activator addition and different activators on the removal rate of DIC were researched, respectively. The removal rate of DIC reached 96.3% when the persulfate and the Fe-0 addition were 1,50 mM and 3.00 mM, respectively. The results showed that SO4 center dot- and center dot OH existed simultaneously in the reaction system, and the removal of DIC was the result of the two free radicals. Moreover, degradation pathways and mechanism of DIC were also discussed. The study may provide a new theoretical basis and technical support for the treatment of DIC in municipal wastewater.

AB Biological degradation in packed bed anaerobic mesophilic reactors with five different support materials was studied for the treatment of chemical-pharmaceutical wastewater with high COD (23-31 g/L), which contains toxic organic compounds. Experimental up-flow bio-filters were operated at different organic loads for a two-year period. Removals of 80-98% were obtained in the reactors with sand, anthracite and black tezontle, but at relatively low organic loads, less than 3.6 kg m(-3) d(-1). The reactor with granular activated carbon (GAC) had a better performance; efficiencies higher than 95% were obtained at loads up to 17kg m(-3) d(-1) and higher than 80% with loads up to 26 kg m(-3) d(-1). Second in performance was the reactor with red tezontle which allows COD removals higher than 80% with loads up to 6 kg m(-3) d(-1). The use of GAC as support material allows greater biodegradation rates than the rest of the materials and it makes the process more resistant to organic load increases, inhibition effects and toxicity. Methanogenic activity was inhibited at loads higher than 21.9 kg m(-3) d(-1) in the GAC-reactor and at loads higher than 3.6 kg m(-3) d(-1) in the rest of the reactors. At loads lower than the previously mentioned, high methane production yield was obtained, 0.32-0.35 m(3)CH(4)/kg CODremoved.

AB Microorganisms with high tetracycline (TC) degradation efficiencies are required for biological processes for TC-containing wastewater treatment. With multiple enrichment cultures, a TC-degrading strain TR5 was isolated from chicken manure mixture in a large broiler farm, which was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical properties. Strain TR5 could degrade TC quickly (similar to 90% within 36 h) with the initial TC concentration of 200 mg/L under optimized conditions via single-factor experiment coupled with RSM. Strain TR5 could detoxify TC and generate much less toxic products as long as cultured more than one day. Three TC-degrading pathways were proposed based on 8 possible products. A transformant containing a plasmid from TR5 acquired TC-degrading ability, indicating that TC-degrading genes were located on this plasmid. Complete sequencing of pYK5 showed that isomerase-, oxidoreductase-, and transferases-encoding genes were found and were inferred to be involved in TC degradation. TR5 may not degrade TC completely and it can utilize some carboncontaining compounds derived from TC via the effect of formylglutathione hydrolase-encoding gene. Our findings showed that strain TR5 could be a promising agent for wastewater treatment, and genes involved in TC degradation are worthy of further investigations for enzyme preparations development.

AB A new analytical method has been developed, optimised, and validated for simultaneous detection and identification of betrixaban, an oral anticoagulant drug approved recently by food and drug administration (FDA), and hexazinone, a broad-spectrum triazine herbicide, in aqueous media by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The method was validated by the limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, matrix effect, recovery, precision, and accuracy. The recovery experiments were carried out on raw wastewater samples, spiked with these two compounds, using solid phase extraction (SPE). It is the first time that betrixaban has been analysed for environmental samples. The developed analytical method can be applied for more in-depth studies on the fate and occurrence of these compounds in the engineered and natural aquatic environment. The key benefits of the method described here are:
   It is highly suitable for betrixaban and hexazinone detection and quantification in aqueous samples.
   It can be successfully applied for understanding the fate of betrixaban and hexazinone in real-world water samples.
   Method validation revealed that the method is repeatable, robust, and accurate and can be expanded to include detection of other pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aqueous media. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Polyvinyl chloride/polycarbonate hollow fiber membranes incorporated with modified silver nanoparticles were prepared by wet spinning method. Fabricated membranes were then characterized by FESEM, EDX, TGA, contact angle, pure water flux and mechanical tests. It was found that the addition of modified silver nanoparticles changed the structure of hollow fiber membranes and the size of macrovoids in the middle layer decreased whereas the thickness of sponge-like outer layer increased. The results of EDX analysis showed that the modified silver nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly throughout the membranes. In addition, degradation temperature of the membranes increased as the content of nanoparticles increased which shows that thermal resistance of membranes was improved. The number of pores on the membrane surface increased due to the presence of nanoparticles but mean pore radius decreased. Addition of modified nanoparticles also improved hydrophilicity, tensile strength and elongation of hollow fiber membranes. The membranes were finally used in a membrane bioreactor system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed during 28 days and the results revealed that incorporation of modified silver nanoparticles enhanced antifouling properties of hollow fiber membranes. Moreover, pure water flux and COD removal as the criteria of membrane performance increased simultaneously. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants that have been found ubiquitously in wastewater and surface waters around the world. A major source of these compounds is incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste, resulting in discharge into surface waters by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. One pharmaceutical found in particularly high abundance in recent WWTP effluent and surface water studies is metformin, one of the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drugs. Interactions between insulin signaling and steroidogenesis suggest potential endocrine-disrupting effects of metformin found in the aquatic environment. Adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were chronically exposed to metformin for 4 wk, at 40 mu g/L, a level similar to the average found in WWTP effluent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Genetic endpoints related to metabolism and endocrine function as well as reproduction-related endpoints were examined. Metformin treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption. The present study, the first to study the effects of environmentally relevant metformin exposure in fathead minnows, demonstrates the need for further study of the endocrine-disrupting effects of metformin in aquatic organisms.

AB In response to water scarcity, strategies relying on multiple processes to turn wastewater effluent into potable water are being increasingly considered by many cities. In such context, the occurrence of contaminants as well as their fate during treatment processes is a major concern. Three analytical approaches where used to characterize the efficacy of UV and UV/H2O2 processes on a secondary wastewater effluent. The first analytical approach assessed bulk organic parameters or surrogates before and after treatment, while the second analytical approach measured the removal of specific indicator compounds. Sixteen trace organic contaminants were selected due to their relative high concentration and detection frequency over eight monitoring campaigns. While their removal rate ranges from approximately 10 to >90%, some of these compounds can be used to gauge process efficacy (or failure). The third analytical approach assessed the fate of unknown contaminants through high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry with advanced data processing and demonstrated the occurrence of several thousand organic compounds in the water. A heat map clearly evidenced compounds as recalcitrant or transformed by the UV processes applied. In addition, those chemicals with similar fate were grouped together into clusters to identify new indicator compounds. In this manuscript, each approach is evaluated with advantages and disadvantages compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Human health risk associated with direct potable reuse - evaluation
   through quantitative relative risk assessment case studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Quantitative relative risk assessment (QRRA) evaluations were conducted for two hypothetical direct potable reuse (DPR) case studies. The goal of a risk assessment is to estimate the severity and likelihood of harm to human health or the environment occurring from exposure to a risk agent. Each case study compares a No Project Alternative (raw water that has undergone drinking water treatment) with a potential DPR Alternative (treated wastewater that has undergone advanced water treatment and drinking water treatment). Neither DPR scenario accounts for blending with raw drinking water prior to drinking water treatment, blending after drinking water treatment in the potable distribution system, or blending via directly distributing the purified reclaimed water into a drinking water distribution system. The QRRA focuses on chemicals that are currently regulated and chemicals that are not yet regulated but are of broad interest, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Pathogen risk evaluation was not conducted but could follow a similar approach. The results illustrate how QRRA can inform water supply decisions that are made with respect to industrial pretreatment/source control, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, and advanced treatment for DPR. In these case studies, the DPR alternatives are projected to provide protection from regulated constituents and constituents of emerging concern that are comparable to or better than the No Project Alternatives. The results also indicate that future QRRA studies would benefit from specific information that could be obtained through targeted research.

AB A novel thin-layer photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactor has been developed and successfully applied to the degradation of tetracycline, a typical pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), in bulk wastewater treatment. The reactor is designed with double thin-layer in order to increase the A/V ratio (ratio of electrode area and solution volume) and improve the mass transfer as well as the photonic efficiency of the system. The efficiency of organic degradation by the new reactor is much higher in comparison with conventional PEC process under similar treatment conditions. Using 20-120 mg L-1 model tetracycline wastewater as the target organics, the PEC removal rate of tetracycline in the reactor reached 96.4-54.8% with a single-side illumination, much higher than that of conventional PEC reactor (about 80.4-14.6%) within 1 h. When the reactor was illuminated from double sides, the treatment efficiency of thin-layer reactor was doubled without increasing new electrodes. This novel reactor always keeps high quantum efficiency regardless of the different concentration levels of the organic compounds, especially superior for the treatment of high concentration solutions. Repeated experiments in the treatment of 400 mg L-1 tetracycline solution demonstrated excellent stability and reliability of the TNAs electrode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding and acquiring knowledge about the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) is imperative to the chemical engineering applications of CNMs, as well as to risk assessment and pollution control of both CNMs and pharmaceuticals. A computational assessment of the mechanism and thermodynamics of the adsorption of 18 most common pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibric acid, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, phenazone, primidone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tramadol) on four different CNMs (pristine/functionalised graphene and carbon nanotube) in two different solvents (water and n-octanol) was provided. We show that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on pristine CNMs is controlled by dispersion forces, pi-interactions and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, adsorption on functionalised CNMs is controlled by hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how functionalization of CNM, CNM curvature and background solution properties modulate the intensity of non-covalent interactions and their contribution towards adsorption free energy. With this knowledge, we pinpoint functionalised graphene at environmental pH as the most effective setting for the removal of a given set of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. Finally, we show that CNMs may transport pharmaceuticals into living organisms and release them in nonpolar mediums such as cellular membranes and fat cells.

AB Photocatalytic degradation of typical pharmaceuticals in natural sunlight and in actual water is of great significance. In this study, the oxygen or nitrogen linked heptazine-base polymer (ONLH) was successfully incorporated with TiO2 nanoparticles and formed a TiO2/ONLH nanocomposite which was responded to the natural sunlight. Under natural sunlight, the TiO2/ONLH can effectively degrade ten types of pharmaceuticals. In particular, fluoroquinolone containing N-piperazinyl, and cardiovascular drugs containing long aromatic side chains were easily degraded. The half-life of the best degradation performance of propranolol was less than 5 min. The rate constants of propranolol using the TiO2/ONLH were approximately sixand eight-fold higher than those of pristine TiO2 and ONLH, respectively. Two reactive species ((OH)-O-center dot and O2(center dot-)) facilitated the rapid degradation of propranolol, which occurred primarily through the hydroxyl radical addition, ring-opening, and ipso substitution reactions. An acute toxicity test using luminescent bacteria indicated that the toxicity of the propranolol reaction solution gradually decreased with lower total organic carbon (TOC). According to the toxicity evaluation of monomer products, the TiO2/ONLH also reduced the generation of toxic transformation products. The effects of actual water/wastewater have further shown the TiO2/ONLH might be applied for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater.

AB Wastewater reuse presents a promising way to mitigate the risk to global water resources and achieve sustainability in water, especially in agricultural areas in the southeast of Spain, such as the Murcia region. However, the risks related to the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) or pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent suggest the need to implement effective and relatively low-cost tertiary treatments. With this aim, a self-sustainable pilot prototype based on three combined modules (disc-filtration, granular activated carbon (GAC) bed adsorption and UV disinfection) assisted by solar panels was installed as an alternative tertiary treatment in a conventional WWTP in the Murcia region. The obtained results clearly confirmed the efficiency of the proposed prototype for CECs removal, and showed optimal results at a workflow of 500 L/h. In all cases, high removal efficiency was obtained for the different indicator microorganisms described in the recently published Regulation (EU) 2020/741 (E. coli, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages, total coliphages, and Clostridium perfringens). The protection of the activated carbon by disc-filters and the energy autonomy and self-operation of the prototype resulted in an efficient and economically viable methodology for its implementation in both conventional WWTPs and in isolated areas attached to crops.

AB Although granular activated carbon (GAC) has been broadly applied in ozone-biologically activated carbon filtration (O-3/BAC) systems for potable reuse of municipal wastewater, the mechanisms of various pollutant removal remain largely unknown as the regenerated GAC develops microbial populations resulting in biofiltration but loses significant adsorption capacity as it becomes spent GAC. Therefore, pilot-scale parallel performance comparisons of spent and regenerated GAC, along with a range of preoxidant ozone doses, were used to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the removal of various types of treatment byproduct precursors and trace organic compounds. It was confirmed from this pilot-study that ozone alone can effectively degrade chlorinated trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors, chloramine-reactive N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors, and 29 PPCP5. In contrast, biodegradation by microbial population on spent or regenerated GAC can remove NDMA and 22 PPCPs, while the adsorption by regenerated GAC can remove chlorinated THM and HAA precursors, PFAS, flame retardants, and 27 PPCP5. The results of this pilot study are intended to provide those interested in potable reuse with an example of the simultaneous removal capabilities and mechanisms that can be anticipated for treating a complex mixture of organics present in real municipal wastewater effluent.

AB Ozonation and three (biological) filtration techniques (trickling filtration (TF), slow sand filtration (SSF) and biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration) have been evaluated in different combinations as tertiary treatment for municipal wastewater effluent. The removal of 18 multi-class pharmaceuticals, as model trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), has been studied. (Biological) activated carbon filtration could reduce the amount of TrOCs significantly (>99%) but is cost-intensive for full-scale applications. Filtration techniques mainly depending on biodegradation mechanisms (TF and SSF) are found to be inefficient for TrOCs removal as a stand alone technique. Ozonation resulted in 90% removal of the total amount of quantified TrOCs, but a post-ozonation step is needed to cope with an increased unselective toxicity. SSF following ozonation showed to be the only technique able to reduce the unselective toxicity to the same level as before ozonation. In view of process control, innovative correlation models developed for the monitoring and control of TrOC removal during ozonation, are verified for their applicability during ozonation in combination with TF, SSF or BAC. Particularly for the poorly ozone reactive TrOCs, statistically significant models were obtained that correlate TrOC removal and reduction in UVA254 as an online measured surrogate parameter.

AB Sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is a widely prescribed antidepressant in North America. Though sertraline is continuously released from wastewater treatment plant discharge to surface water, effects of aqueous exposure of sertraline on behavioral responses of aquatic animals are largely unknown. Our study explored the effects of aqueous exposures of sertraline on antagonistic bouts and predator response behavior of virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis). Crayfish were either exposed or not exposed to waterborne sertraline and then size-matched for paired antagonistic bouts to determine if sertraline affects the aggression of each crayfish. We investigated the effect of sertraline on responses to visual predator cues and determined whether sertraline acts as an olfactory cue. Our results demonstrate that crayfish exposed to sertraline are more aggressive when paired with control crayfish but, when sertraline crayfish are paired, there is no change in aggression. Attraction response to sertraline in behavioral mazes was also observed, which may represent a maladaptive behavior, and in an ecological context may result in crayfish moving to areas with elevated levels of sertraline. However, aqueous exposure to sertraline had no effect on predator responses of crayfish. Future research is warranted to determine whether such medicine released in wastewater treatment plant effluents produces long-term ecologically important consequences for aquatic animals residing in urbanized aquatic ecosystems.

AB Seventeen pharmaceutically active compounds and 22 other trace organic pollutants were analysed regularly in the influent and permeate from a semi-real plant treating municipal wastewater. The plant was operated during 29 months with different configurations which basically differed in the type of biomass present in the system. These processes were the integrated fixed-film activated sludge membrane bioreactor (IFAS-MBR), which combined suspended and attached biomass, the moving bed membrane bioreactor (MBMBR) (only attached biomass) and the MBR (only suspended biomass). Moreover, removal rates were compared to those of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operating nearby with conventional activated sludge treatment. Reverse osmosis (RO) was used after the pilot plant to improve removal rates. The highest elimination was found for the IFAS-MBR, especially for hormones (100% removal); this was attributed to the presence of biofilm, which may lead to different conditions (aerobic-anoxic-anaerobic) along its profile, which increases the degradation possibilities, and also to a higher sludge age of the biofilm, which allows complete acclimation to the contaminants. Operating conditions played an important role, high mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and sludge retention time (SRT) being necessary to achieve these high removal rates. Although pharmaceuticals and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates showed high removal rates (65-100%), nonylphenols and phthalate could only be removed to 10-30%. RO significantly increased removal rates to 88% mean removal rate.

AB Concern over prospective levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in waters has increased in recent years due to its disinfection byproduct formation potential from chloramination. It has been mooted that this is promoted by organic precursors from municipal wastewaters, such that there is a more significant risk of excessive levels in water reuse applications.
   Experiments conducted on chloramination and chlorination of secondary wastewater have confirmed that that significant NDMA formation arises only from chloramination, with its concentration varying with test conditions used. A full factor analysis revealed all parameters studied (temperature, pH, monochloramine dose and contact time), both individually and synergistically, to have a statistically significant impact on NDMA formation with contact time being the most important. At raw water temperatures below 10 degrees C, the NDMA concentration can be minimised to below the 10 ng L-1 threshold by not exceeding a monochloramine dose of 2 mg L-1 as Cl-2. However, at higher water temperatures other measures are required to suppress NDMA formation, such as reducing the contact time (which could prove impractical in most applications) or maintaining a pH below 6. Further trials are required to fully develop the operating envelope to ensure NDMA concentrations do not exceed the 10 ng L-1 threshold, or else to identify effective pretreatment methods for removing the NDMA precursors.

The prepared nanomaterials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photodegradation of atenolol as a model pharmaceutical pollutant in wastewater was investigated under ultraviolet-visible light irradiation using the different synthesized nanocatalysts. In the presence of 0.75 g center dot L-1 AgCl nanoparticles, a practically complete degradation of 10 ppm of atenolol was obtained after 30 min, following pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The effect of different variables (concentrations, pH, oxidant agents, etc.) was analyzed. The recyclability of the nanocatalyst was tested and found to be successful. A degradation mechanism was also proposed. In order to improve the recovery stage of the nanocatalyst, the use of magnetic nanocomposites is proposed. Under the same experimental conditions, a slightly lower and slower degradation was achieved with an easier separation. The main conclusions of the paper are the suitability of the use of ionic liquids to prepare different nanocatalysts and the effectiveness of these at degrading an emerging pollutant in wastewater treatment.

AB The present study investigates the degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) using TiO2 photocatalysis and sono-photocatalysis in aqueous solution under UV-A (365 nm) and sunlight exposure. The photocatalysis, as well as sono-photocatalysis, were coupled with H2O2 as well to assess the improvement in the degradation of AMX. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on three-level and four variable Box-Behnken experiment design was used to analyse and validate the degradation of AMX. Upon comparison of observed values with predicted, the value of the coefficient of regression (R-2) was 0.87 which indicate the good fit of the model. The optimum conditions for maximum degradation (80%) of AMX were AMX - 30mg/l, TiO2 dosage - 450mg/l, H2O2 concentration - 150 mg/l and pH - 7.0 under UV irradiation (672 W/m(2)). Significant improvement in rate kinetics of degradation was observed when photocatalysis was complemented with H2O2 and sonication (40 KHz) under optimized condition, but the maximal removal remained almost unaffected. The method proved efficient towards degradation of AMX in real pharmaceutical wastewater with reduced reaction time for targeted level treatment. It was concluded that photocatalysis is a potential method for degradation of AMX under the set optimized conditions, and it may be adopted in-silo since photocatalysis coupled with sonication becomes energy-prohibitive for degradation of AMX.

AB The current research work investigated the effective utilization of automobile shredder residue (ASR) fly ash as an alternative iron source to degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants like tetracycline (TC) via a visible-light-driven photo-Fenton-like process at neutral pH. The whole photodegradation process was carried out in a fixed mode by using highly durable ASR fly ash beads as the catalyst in the photo-Fenton reaction. As confirmed through several characterization techniques, these beads contained hematite, goethite, magnetite, pyrite and wustite forms of iron oxides. Moreover, iron cations (Fe2+ and Fe3+) had leached out from the ASR fly ash beads during the reaction, which further promoted the photo-Fenton process. The detailed mechanism for the photodegradation of TC using ASR fly ash beads was studied. The high photodegradation efficiency of TC after 3 h of natural solar irradiation further confirmed the real-time applications of ASR fly ash in wastewater treatment. The ASR fly ash beads remained active and stable even after 10 recycling tests, as cross confirmed through characterization tests. Therefore, the obtained results clearly indicated that the use of ASR fly ash in wastewater treatment can add value to waste while providing a low cost and sustainable solution to various industries.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is carcinogenic in rodents and occurs in chloraminated drinking water and wastewater effluents. NDMA forms via reactions between chloramines and mostly unidentified, N-containing organic matter. We developed a mass spectrometry technique to identify NDMA precursors by analyzing 25 model compounds with LC/QTOF-MS. We searched isolates of 11 drinking water sources and 1 wastewater using a custom MATLAB (R) program and extracted ion chromatograms for two fragmentation patterns that were specific to the model compounds. Once a diagnostic fragment was discovered, we conducted MS/MS during a subsequent injection to confirm the precursor ion. Using non-target searches and two diagnostic fragmentation patterns, we discovered 158 potential NDMA precursors. Of these, 16 were identified using accurate mass combined with fragment and retention time matches of analytical standards when available. Five of these sixteen NDMA precursors were previously unidentified in the literature, three of which were metabolites of pharmaceuticals. Except methadone, the newly identified precursors all had NDMA molar yields of less than 5%, indicating that NDMA formation could be additive from multiple compounds, each with low yield. We demonstrate that the method is applicable to other disinfection by-product precursors by predicting and verifying the fragmentation patterns for one nitrosodiethylamine precursor.

AB The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) during treatment are modern, based on available literature. Therefore, such emissions were omitted from IPCC's greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting procedures. However, a fraction of wastewater's carbon is fossil in origin. We hypothesized that since the fossil carbon entering municipal WRRFs is mostly from soaps and detergents as dissolved organic matter, its fate can be selectively determined during the universally applied separation treatment processes. Analyzing radiocarbon at different treatment points within municipal WRRFs, we verified that the fossil content could amount to 28% in primary influent and showed varying distribution leaving different unit operations. We recorded the highest proportion of fossil carbon leaving the secondary treatment as off-gas and as solid sludge (averaged 2.08 kg fossil-CO2-emission-potential m(-3) wastewater treated). By including fossil CO2, total GHG emission in municipal WRRFs increased 13%, and 23% if an on-site energy recovery system exists although much of the postdigestion fossil carbon remained in biosolids rather than in biogas, offering yet another carbon sequestration opportunity during biosolids handling. In comparison, fossil carbon contribution to GHG emission can span from negligible to substantial in different types of industrial WRRFs. With such a considerable impact, CO2 should be analyzed for each WRRF and not omitted from GHG accounting.

AB YYA Na+ exchanged montmorillonite clay (Na-Mt) and its organoclay derivatives prepared with benzyl-dimethyltetradecylammonium (BDTA) cationic and polyoxyethylene (20)oleyl-ether (Brij-O20) non-ionic surfactants were used for first time at our knowledge as adsorbents the removal diverse pharmaceuticals (PPs) from samples collected in a rural wastewater facility (town of Josnes in France). The selected facility showed a poor efficiency for the elimination of PPs that were permanently release to the environment. Although involving different interactional mechanisms, the whole adsorbents Na-Mt, nonionic Brij-Mt and cationic BDTA-Mt organoclays, could remove the entire PPs of various chemical nature in a low concentration regime (ng L-1), where electrostatic interactions mainly controlled the adsorption. Thus, the organic PPs cations were preferentially adsorbed onto Na-Mt and Brij(0.4)-Mt (with its dual hydrophilic-hydrophobic nature) while anionic PPs showed a bold affinity to BDTA-Mt. The hydrophobic environment generated by the intercalation of surfactants within the interlayer space of organoclays conferred a versatility for the adsorption of numerous PPs through weak molecular forces (Van derWaals and/or pi-pi interactions). The study confirmed the proper efficiency of the studied layered materials including organoclays and emphasized about their promising interests in water remediation strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Population growth, industrialization and the lack of restrictions on the use of recalcitrant compounds have led to the release of large amounts of pollutants. Water resources have been particularly affected by the presence of these compounds because the conventional wastewater treatments are unable to completely remove these pollutants. In fact, certain pharmaceutical products have been detected in drinking water at concentrations as high as 0.3 mu g/L. The seriousness of environmental pollution has triggered the development of scientific activities for the prevention and control of water pollution; among them, the application of enzymatic processes is emerging as a promising alternative. The stability of some ligninolytic enzymes and the development of processes for their repeated reuse, have been fundamental to scale-up enzymatic experiments from test-tubes to full-scale reactors. This review shows the key advances for scaling-up the enzymatic degradation processes, the problems that have arisen during the operation of different reactors and the strategies that have served to solve these problems. Finally, the work includes a cost comparison between the utilization of enzymatic treatments and other technologies. The available information indicates that enzymatic treatments have a real potential to compete with other processes in terms of efficiency, costs and environmental impact.

AB Nowadays, ensuring the protection and health of the environment is an effective step toward sustainable development. One of the primary environmental concerns around the world is the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from water and wastewater. Solving such problem and many other environmental issues, along with treading the path toward sustainable development, can be achieved with the use of nanotechnology. This study investigated the use of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in removing the beta-blocker atenolol from aqueous solutions. To achieve this goal, the efficiency of atenolol removal was evaluated in a four-level Taguchi experiment that involved the evaluation of pH value (2-11), contact time (5-90 min), adsorbent dose (0.5-2 g/L), and initial atenolol concentration (10-90 mg/L). Data analysis and interpretation were performed using Design Expert 6. The results indicated that the highest atenolol removal (94.8%) occurred at a pH of 7, a contact time of 20 min, an atenolol concentration of 10 mg/L, and a MWCNT dose of 0.5 g/L. The adsorption capacity of the MWCNTs used in this work was 16.76 mg/g. The data analysis based on the adsorption isotherm models of the Isotherm Fitting Tool showed good agreement with the results of a linear model. The findings confirmed that MWCNTs present great potential as effective adsorbents for the removal of atenolol from water and wastewater.

AB This article investigates the ability of Pseudomonas peli to treat industrial pharmaceuticals wastewater (PW). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis revealed the presence, in this PW, of a variety of antibiotics such as sulfathiazole, sulfamoxole, norfloxacine, cloxacilline, doxycycline, and cefquinome. P. peli was very effective to be grown in PW and inducts a remarkable increase in chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand (140.31 and 148.51%, respectively). On the other hand, genotoxicity of the studied effluent, before and after 24 h of shaking incubation with P. peli, was evaluated in vivo in the Mediterranean wild mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation. Results show that PW exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.001) genotoxic effect in a dose-dependent manner; indeed, the percentage of genotoxicity was 122.6 and 49.5% after exposure to 0.66 ml/kg body weight (b.w.); 0.33 ml/kg b.w. of PW, respectively. However, genotoxicity decreased strongly when tested with the PW obtained after incubation with P. peli. We can conclude that using comet assay genotoxicity end points are useful tools to biomonitor the physicochemical and biological quality of water. Also, it could be concluded that P. peli can treat and detoxify the studied PW.

AB After ingestion, pharmaceuticals are excreted unchanged or metabolized. They subsequently arrive in conventional wastewater treatment plants and are then released into the environment, often without undergoing any degradation. Conventional treatment plants can be upgraded with post treatment, alternatively the removal of pharmaceuticals could be achieved directly at point sources. In the European project PILLS, several solutions for decentralized treatment of pharmaceuticals at hospitals were investigated at both pilot plant and full scale, and were then compared to conventional and upgraded centralized treatment plants using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Within the scope of the study, pharmaceuticals were found to have a comparatively minor environmental impact. As a consequence, an additional post treatment does not provide significant benefits. In the comparison of post treatment technologies, ozonation and activated carbon performed better than UV. These results suffer however from high uncertainties due to the assessment models of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in LCA. Our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. LCA is a holistic approach and does not cover effects or issues on a local level, which may be highly relevant. We should therefore apply the precautionary ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) and not conclude that the effect of pharmaceuticals is negligible in the environment.

AB The aim of this work was to study the mineralization of acetaminophen (ACTP) present in synthetic municipal wastewater effluent (SE.) in a UV-A/C pilot plant using a homogeneous photo-Fenton oxidation process with continuous addition of H(2)O(2) to the system.
   The mineralization process was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Experimental kinetic constants were fitted using neural networks (NNs). The mathematical model reproduced the experimental data to within a 90% confidence level. At the optimum conditions (H(2)O(2) flow rate = 50 mL/h, [Fe(II)]= 2 ppm, pH = 2.5 and temperature = 40 degrees C), 71.5%, 82.1% and 94% of COT, COD and BDO-5 were removed in 120 min respectively.
   Determination of the hydrogen peroxide consumed and remaining in the water revealed that 5.8 mol of H(2)O(2) were consumed per each mol of total organic carbon removed from solution. It was also confirmed that an excess of dissolved H(2)O(2) is needed to achieve high mineralization rates, so continuous addition of peroxide is recommended for industrial application of this process.
   Comparison experiments of scavenger-loaded conditions proved that the reaction takes place mainly through a radical and single oxygen mechanism (96.7%). The molecular pathway (0.7%) and direct photolysis (2.6%) are secondary. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Absolute second-order rate constants for the reaction between the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and eight water samples containing non-isolated effluent organic matter (EfOM) collected at different wastewater and reclamation sites were measured by electron pulse radiolysis. The measured rate constants ranged from 0.27 to 1.21 x 10(9) M-C(-1) s(-1), with an average value of 0.86 ( +/- 0.35) x 10(9) M-C(-1) s(-1). These absolute values were 3-5 times faster than previously reported values using natural organic matter and wastewater isolates. The obtained rate constants were correlated (R-2 > 0.99) to bulk EfOM properties through an empirical equation that included terms relating to the polarity, apparent molecular weight, and fluorescence index of the effluent organic matter. The obtained data were used to model steady state (OH)-O-center dot concentrations during UV advanced oxidation. The steady-state (OH)-O-center dot concentration was lower than that obtained using previously reported values for the reaction with dissolved organic matter, indicating that accurate measurement of reaction rate constants at specific sites would greatly improve the design and prediction of the removal of organic contaminants. These results will improve the ability of researchers to accurately model scavenging capacities during the advanced oxidation process treatment of wastewaters.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial agent widely used in many personal care products. This study investigated the occurrence of TCS in effluents, biosolids and surface waters, and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The aqueous concentrations of TCS in nineteen effluents from Australian WWTPs ranged from 23 ng/L to 434 ng/L with a median concentration of 108 ng/L, while its concentrations in nineteen biosolids ranged from 0.09 mg/kg to 16.79 mg/kg on dry weight basis with a median concentration of 2.32 mg/kg. The removal rates for TCS in five selected WWTPs were found to range between 72% and 93%. Biological degradation was believed to be the predominant removal mechanism for TCS in the WWTPs. However, adsorption onto sludge also played a significant role in the removal of TCS in the WWTPs. TCS at concentrations up to 75 ng/L was detected in surface waters (outfall, upstream, and downstream) from five rivers receiving effluent discharge from WWTPs. Preliminary risk assessment based on the worst-case scenario showed that the TCS concentrations in surface waters might lead to risks to aquatic organisms such as algae. Based on the TCS levels in the biosolids, application of biosolids on agricultural land may also cause adverse effects in the soil environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread use of antibiotics has led to their ubiquitous presence in water and wastewater and raised concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Clinical antibiotic susceptibility assays have been repurposed to measure removal of antimicrobial activity during water and wastewater treatment processes. The corresponding protocols have mainly employed growth inhibition of Escherichia coli. The present work focused on optimizing bacteria selection to improve the sensitivity of residual antimicrobial activity measurements by broth microdilution assays. Thirteen antibiotics from four classes (i.e., fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines) were investigated against three gram-negative organisms, namely E. coli, Mycoplasma microti, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) were calculated for each antibiotic-bacteria pair. P. fluorescens produces a fluorescent siderophore, pyoverdine, that was used to assess sublethal effects and further enhance the sensitivity of antimicrobial activity measurements. The optimal antibiotic-bacteria pairs were as follows: fluoroquinolone-E. coli (growth inhibition); macrolide- and sulfonamide-M. microti (growth inhibition); and, tetracycline-P. fluorescens (pyoverdine inhibition). Compared to E. coli growth inhibition, the sensitivity of antimicrobial activity analysis was improved by up to 728, 19, and 2.7 times for macrolides (tylosin), sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole), and tetracyclines (chlortetracycline), facilitating application of these bioassays at environmentally-relevant conditions.

AB Untreated organic contaminants in municipal wastewater, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have become a significant issue in aquatic ecosystems, particularly in freshwater bodies that receive wastewater discharge. This has raised concerns about the accumulation of EDCs in aquatic species via continuous exposure. This study evaluated the uptake of EDCs by quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), an invasive species in a water supply reservoir. The field sampling results showed that steroid hormones were not detected in the water samples, and only pharmaceuticals and personal care products were present (0.49 to 36ng/L). Additionally, testosterone was the most abundant steroid in the mussel tissue (6.3 to 20ng/g dry weight), and other synthetic chemicals (i.e., bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid) were also detected in the mussel tissue (24 to 47ng/g dry weight). After being exposed to exogenous EDCs for 7, 21, and 42days under controlled laboratory conditions, testosterone was not detected in the mussel anymore, but bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid were found at relatively high levels in the mussel tissue, although the concentrations did not increase over time. Overall, the study demonstrated the uptake of EDCs in quagga mussels, which suggests that this species can be used to reflect water quality deterioration in aquatic ecosystems.

AB We investigated the effects of activated carbon, used as constructed wetlands (CWs) medium, on its ability to remove four emerging endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs): bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and 4-tert-butylphenol (4-tert-BP). Two types of CWs planted with common reed were constructed, one with pumice rock called normal CW and the other was amended with activated carbon (AC) called AC-CW. EDCs contaminated synthetic wastewater (5 mg/L of each) was treated by CWs for 8 weeks. AC-CW completely and sustainably removed all four EDCs (98-100%) starting immediately and continuing throughout the experiment. Removal performances of all EDCs by AC-CW were significantly higher than those by normal CW. After experiment, no BPA and BPF and very small amounts of BPS and 4-tert-BP were detected in AC. In AC-CW, final elimination step of EDCs might be biodegradation. In addition, bacterial populations on AC component of AC-CW were one-two orders higher than those on the pumice rock of normal CW. Therefore, in AC-CW, EDCs were initially adsorbed onto AC, where they could be effectively degraded by high bacterial population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The oxidation of two industrial chemicals abundant in the environment, i.e., benzothiazole (BTH) and 1H-benzotriazole (BTA) was investigated in UV and UV/H2O2-systems using polychromatic mercury lamp. Experiments were performed in Milli-Q (TM) water solutions of BTH and BTA at pH 5, 7 and 9 and in synthetic wastewater spiked with BTH and BTA pre-treated in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Results showed that polychromatic UV-radiation is an efficient oxidative agent for BTH and BTA abatement in water and wastewater. In the kinetic study direct photolysis quantum yields at pH 7 were calculated as 0.022 and 0.051 for BTH and BTA, respectively, and the second-order rate constant for the reaction between investigated compounds and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) were determined to be (9.5 +/- 1.7).10(8) M-1 s(-1) and (2.7 +/- 0.1).10(9) M-1 s(-1), for BTH and BTA at pH 7, respectively. Identification of transformation products performed with liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry provided information about 6 and 5 transformation products formed during the photodegradation of BTH and BTA, respectively. The Microtox bioassay showed that direct photolysis is efficient to detoxify BTH and BTA in aqueous solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The agricultural use of wastewater biosolids is a common practice in many countries, but concerns exist regarding the presence of organic wastewater contaminants that remain in the land-applied biosolids. The objective of this study was to determine if contaminants present in biosolids are detectable in soil following land application. A suite of organic contaminants were monitored by gas chromatograph with mass spectrometer in agricultural soil samples from a site amended with increasing rates of alkaline-treated biosolids. Triclosan, a common antimicrobial agent, was detected at levels greater than the reporting limit in an environment-controlled incubation study and validated through in situ field samples from soils receiving the same alkaline-treated biosolid. A rapid decrease in triclosan concentration was observed during the first few weeks of the incubation study, with concentrations decreasing from 92 +/- 26 to 20 +/- 2 ng g(-1) (average 78% decrease) after 4 mo. The field results indicate that triclosan in fall-applied may persist overwinter. However, a rapid decrease in triclosan concentration during the spring and summer months led to levels lower than predicted following the spring application, and levels below our reporting limit (up to 85% decrease) by the end of the study. Removal is posited to be through aerobic microbial degradation.

AB The use of pharmaceuticals has increased enormously over the last few decades and serious concerns about their environmental fate and effects have arisen. Thus far, there is little knowledge about the historical pollution of the environment by pharmaceuticals. In the present study, sediment columns from three lake sites adjacent to wastewater treatment plants were collected, further divided in 2- or 2.5-cm slices, and analyzed for 15 pharmaceuticals by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, sediment columns were historically interpreted by analyzing fecal sterols (coprostanol and cholesterol) as well as organic material and organic carbon. Several pharmaceuticals were detected in sediments, the most abundant being citalopram, bisoprolol, and propranolol. At site A, pharmaceuticals prevailed only in the uppermost 15?cm, whereas at site B they existed in the whole sediment column (030?cm). Pharmaceuticals were not found in site C sediments. Based on the sterol analyses, municipal wastewater contamination at sites A, B, and C was found in the uppermost 15, 30, and 20?cm, respectively. For the first time, contamination of sediments by pharmaceuticals was demonstrated below the subsurface (up to a depth of 30?cm). When considering the consumption and the observed concentration profiles of pharmaceuticals, a clear increasing trend of citalopram toward the surface was evident at site A. Environ. Toxicol.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT
AB The aim of this study is to find the macrophytes that possess high resource recovery efficiency in subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (SFCWs) while not pose any negative effects to the treatment performance. Five criteria were included in this analysis. The suitable alternative plants were proposed according to their availabilities in each climate zone. For their potentials as an energy sources, they are related to plants' productivity as well as growth rate. Concerning the utilization options, plants that possess high economical value and/or versatilities were encouraged. Among the options are handicrafts, fertilizers, animal feeds, construction materials, paper making, and pharmaceutical products. In term of nutrient uptakes, in most cases they were relatively minor comparing to other removal mechanisms in SFCWs. No significant differences in term of treatment efficiency could be found. The proposed species have to be able to tolerate the municipal wastewater. The cost differences of plant propagules between each species are marginal, hence they should not be considered as the main selection criteria. Based on an investigation of 45 species worldwide, the recommendation table is developed with 13 suitable species that fit all the criteria. It appears that there are more than one "most appropriate plant species" in each climatic region. To perform the selection, the operators should weight their preferences on each criteria and the availability of plants in the area.

AB This work assessed the effect of increasing microaeration flow rates (1-6 mL min(-1) at 28 degrees C and 1 atm, equivalent to 0.025-0.152 L O-2 L-1 feed) on the removal/biotransformation of seven organic micropollutants (OMPs) (three hormones, one xenoestrogen, and three pharmaceuticals), at 200 mu g L-1 each, in a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7.4 h. Additionally, the operational stability of the system and the evolution of its microbial community under microaerobic conditions were evaluated. Microaeration was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the limited removal/biotransformation of the evaluated OMPs in short-HRT anaerobic wastewater treatment systems. The rise in the airflow rate considerably increased the removal efficiencies of all OMPs. However, there seems to be a saturation limit for the biochemical reactions. Then, the best results were obtained with 4 mL air min(-1) (0.101 L O-2 L-1 feed) (similar to 90%) because, above this flow rate, the efficiency increase was negligible. The long-term exposure to microaerobic conditions (249 days) led the microbiota to a gradual evolution. Consequently, there was some enrichment with species potentially associated with the biotransformation of OMPs, which may explain the better performance at the end of the microaerobic term even with the lowest airflow rate tested.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NAIDS) have been widely detected in wastewater and surface water, which indicates the removal of NAIDS by wastewater treatment plants was not efficiency. Electrochemical advanced oxidation technology is considered to be an effective process. This study presents an investigation of the kinetics, mechanism and influencing factors of Diclofenac (DCF) degradation by an electrochemical process with the boron doped diamond anodes. Relative operating parameters and water quality parameters are examined. It appears that the degradation follows the pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics. DCF degradation was accelerated with the increase of pH from 6 to 10. The degradation was promoted by the addition of electrolyte concentrations and current density. HA and HCO3- significantly inhibited the degradation, whereas Cl- accelerated it. According to the inhibition tests, hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) contributed 76.5% and 6.5%, respectively, to the degradation. Sodium sulphate remains a more effective electrolyte, compared to sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate, suggesting the quenching effect of nitrate and phosphate on center dot OH. Major DCF transformation products were identified. According to the degradation products detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, hydroxylation and decarboxylation are the main pathways to DCF degradation; meanwhile, dechlorination, chlorination and nitro substitution are also included.

AB In recent times the impact of pharmaceutical wastes generated from the pharmaceutical industry and domestic sewages on the aquatic ecosystem has become a major concern. The traditional sole treatment processes are not adequate for the elimination of these wastes. To overcome the lack of the individual treatment processes, integrated treatment methodology has been devised in the present study. The degradation of the pharmaceutical, levosulpiride, by using Ozone (O-3), activated carbon (AC) and biological treatment byA.faecalisJF339228 andE. aurantiacumKX008295.1in its aqueous solution has been investigated. The percentage removal of Levosulpiride from its synthetic aqueous solution of 600 mg/L concentration using 2 g/L activated carbon and 5.2 g/h ozone and biological treatment byA.faecalisJF339228 andE. aurantiacumKX008295.1 in 72 hr were 51.60, 53.50, 39.97, and 37.51% respectively. Simultaneous treatment using adsorption and ozone followed by biological treatment withA. faecalisJF339228 andE. aurantiacumKX008295.1 has been employed in this study. To overcome the demerits of the individual treatment process, the integrated treatment is employed which has shown a synergistic effect in the degradation of levosulpiride with minimal doses of activated carbon, ozone, and minimum time of operation. The percentage removal of levosulpiride achieved was about 76 and 61% for 800 mg/L levosulpiride wastewater, respectively. Therefore, the integrated treatment system is rendered economical, efficient, and safe.

AB Due to current water shortages, the use of water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for horticultural crop irrigation is becoming increasingly common. This practice implies the risk of introducing pharmaceutical compounds into the food chain. The main aim of this work was to study the accumulation of two drugs in lettuces and their subsequent transfer into the food chain. The study focused on two widely used drugs, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (CBZ) and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac (DCF), with different physicochemical properties in terms of their hydrophobicity and solubility in water. Three varieties of lettuce were selected and irrigated with water containing a mixture of the two pharmaceutical compounds at different concentrations. The results show the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bioconcentration factors in the case of CBZ; however, in the case of DCF, by contrast, the highest uptake levels and greatest bioconcentration factors were observed in the roots. For CBZ, the C-leaf/C-root ratio was greater than 1, indicating good root-to-leaf drug translocation, whereas all C-leaf/C-root ratios were less than 1 for DCF. From the data acquired, our evaluation suggests that the concentrations of CBZ and DCF detected in the edible part of the lettuces do not imply any risk to human health.

AB The continuous release of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is of concern due to their potential toxicological effects on living organisms, even at low concentrations. The insufficient removal of bioactive contaminants such as pharmaceuticals by conventional wastewater treatment processes has led scientists to investigate and develop efficient technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to address the issue. The objective of the present work was to study the applicability of thermally prepared Sb-doped Sn-80%-W-20%-oxide thin film coated electrodes for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of a recalcitrant pharmaceutical compound, carbamazepine (CBZ). The efficiency of photolytic and photocatalytic processes for removal of CBZ were also evaluated for comparison. The formation of transformation products was investigated and the results showed lower levels of transformation products in the water treated by the photoelectrocatalytic method compared to the photolytic and photocatalytic methods, by the end of 60-min treatment. This suggests a potentially lower overall toxicity of the final solution treated by the photoelectrocatalytic method. An estimation of the energy consumption to reach an order of magnitude reduction in the concentration of CBZ for each type of process indicated a lower energy requirement for the photoelectrocatalytic method, with the highest energy efficiency observed at the applied current density of 6 mA/cm(2).

AB The complexing agents benzotriazole (BT) and tolyltriazole (TT) are not only widely applied as anticorrosives, e. g., in aircraft deicer and anti-icer fluid (ADAF), but they are also used for so-called silver protection in dishwasher detergents. Due to their low biodegradability and limited sorption tendency, BT and TT are only partly removed in wastewater treatment. Residual concentrations of BT and TT were determined in ambient surface waters in Switzerland including 7 rivers which have distinct water flows and receive treated wastewater effluents at various dilution ratios. A maximum BT concentration of 6.3 mu g/L was found in the Glatt River, and a maximum mass flow of 277 kg BT per week was observed in the Rhine River. In most cases, TT was about a factor 5-10 less abundant. During winter 2003/4, BT mass flows at 2 locations in the lower stretch of the Glatt River clearly indicated the input from nearby Zurich airport, where BT was applied as an anticorrosive ADAF component. BT concentrations measured in the three lakes Greifensee, Lake Zurich, and Lake Geneva were approximately 1.2, 0.1-0.4, and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively. The observed environmental occurrences indicate that BT and TT are ubiquitous contaminants in the aquatic environment and that they belong to the most abundant individual water pollutants.

AB During 2001, 76 water samples were collected upstream and downstream of select towns and cities in Iowa during high-, normal- and low-flow conditions to determine the contribution of urban centers to concentrations of pharmaceuticals and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in streams under varying flow conditions. The towns ranged in population from approximately 2000 to 200 000. Overall, one or more OWCs were detected in 98.7% of the samples collected, with 62 of the 105 compounds being found. The most frequently detected compounds were metolachlor (pesticide), cholesterol (plant and animal sterol), caffeine (stimulant), beta-sitosterol (plant sterol) and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (caffeine degradate). The number of OWCs detected decreased as streamflow increased from low- (51 compounds detected) to normal- (28) to high-flow (24) conditions. Antibiotics and other prescription drugs were only frequently detected during low-flow conditions. During low-flow conditions, 15 compounds (out of the 23) and ten compound groups (out of 11) detected in more than 10% of the streams sampled had significantly greater concentrations in samples collected downstream than in those collected upstream of the urban centers. Conversely, no significant differences in the concentrations were found during high-flow conditions. Thus, the urban contribution of OWCs to streams became progressively muted as streamflow increased. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most detected pharmaceutical compounds around the world, with adverse human and animal health impacts in wastewater effluents. Recently, biocatalytic degradation using ligninolytic enzymes such as laccase along with redox mediators provides a promising approach for their removal from water and wastewater. However, the effects of operational parameters on biotransformation need to be investigated in order to design a robust and efficient process. In this research, central composite design was performed and analyzed using response surface methodology to study the effects of temperature, pH, enzyme concentration and mediator concentration. The adequacy of the developed model was confirmed by the coefficient of multiple regression (R-2 = 75.97%) indicating a reasonable model for practical implementation. The results showed that performing the biotransformation at 35 degrees C, pH 6, with 60 U/L of enzyme concentration and 18 mu M of mediator concentration resulted in 95% removal of CBZ. 10,11-Dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxy-CBZ were identified as the major metabolites of CBZ oxidation by laccase. The estrogenicity tests indicated that the CBZ with an initial concentration of 4 mu M and its biotransformation products had no estrogenic effect. The successful transformation of CBZ demonstrated the potential of the laccase-mediator system for the removal of recalcitrant micro-contaminants.

AB BACKGROUND: In this work, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is utilized to estimate the environmental footprint of solar Fenton oxidation at pilot scale used as a polishing step of secondary-treated urban effluents. All inputs (e.g. natural resources, raw materials, etc.) and outputs (e.g. emissions, etc.) of the process were quantitatively defined and/or estimated. The system under study includes raw materials, energy, land use, chemicals, local transportation needs, and air-/waterborne emissions.
   RESULTS: The main environmental hotspots of this system were identified (i.e. energy consumption and use of chemicals). The environmental sustainability of this technology was found to be high, since its environmental footprint for the treatment of 1 m(3) of wastewater was found to be only 8.7 kg CO2 m(-3), which is approx. 1.6% of the total CO2 emissions of the treatment of the daily effluents of a Cypriot resident. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios were investigated, in order to further enhance its overall environmental performance.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the majority of the environmental impacts of this process could be attributed to indirect emissions, tracing back to electricity generation, followed by emissions from the chemicals used. The most critical improvement identified herein, is the use of a renewable energy source. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Water reclamation through the use of soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a sustainable water management technique with high potential for application in many regions worldwide. However, the fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) during the infiltration of treated wastewater during SAT is still a matter of research. This study investigates the removal capacity of 27 CECs during SAT by means of infiltration experiments into a 6 m soil column. Additionally, the influence of the hydraulic operation of SAT systems on the removal of CECs is investigated by changing the wetting and drying cycle lengths. Sixteen out of 27 CECs are efficiently removed during SAT under various operational modes, e.g., bezafibrate, diclofenac and valsartan. For six substances (4-methylbenzotriazole, amidotrizoic acid, benzotriazole, candesartan, hydrochlorothiazide and sulfamethoxazole), removal increased with longer drying times. Removal of amidotrizoic acid and benzotriazole increased by 85% when the drying cycle was changed from 100 to 444 min. For candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, removal improved by 35%, and for 4-methylbenzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole, by 57% and 39%, respectively. Thus, enhanced aeration of the vadose soil zone through prolonged drying times can be a suitable technique to increase the removal of CECs during SAT.

AB Recently, nanotechnology has been utilized in more or less all fields, such as physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, medicine, etc. In this relation, nanotechnology is also applied in the removal of various impurities/pollutants including pathogenic bacteria and virus from water and other water bodies. Among the various methods used for wastewater treatment, adsorption is found to be one of the better methods because of its low-cost and simplicity of operation. Recently, nanoadsorbents have been explored for the removal of various pollutants from waste water. In this paper, the utilization of nanomaterials, as an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals, organic compounds, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other pollutants, is reviewed and discussed. It is to be mentioned that adsorption capacities of the adsorbents vary depending on the characteristics of the adsorbents. the extent of chemical modification and the concentration of adsorbates. There are also few issues and drawbacks on the utilization of nanoadsorbents that have been addressed. To find out the practical utilization of nanomaterials as low-cost adsorbents on the commercial scale, more research should be conducted in this direction. This review article demonstrated that nanomaterials may be effectively utilized for the treatment of wastewater and may be the future novel and promising adsorbents/materials for water treatment.

AB Since extensive application, an increasing amount of antibiotics has been released into wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system was fed with synthetic wastewater containing erythromycin (ERY) and oxytetracycline (OTC) for 7 days to evaluate the variations of solution ortho-P (SOP), volatile fatty acid (VFA), poly-bhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), specific oxygen uptake rater (SOUR), and microbial community in the EBPR system. The obtained results showed that the P-removal efficiency decreased to 0.0%, and at the end of the experiment, only less than 20% of the VFA could be consumed. Besides, the variable processes of P and PHAs were destroyed. Moreover, to better grasp the inhibitory mechanism of antibiotics, microbial community compositions of activated sludge sampled in all reactors were investigated by high-throughput sequencing techniques. Results of comparative and evolutionary analysis revealed that high concentrations (5 and 10 mg/L) of ERY and OTC could seriously shift microbial communities, while combined antibiotics could induce more. Additionally, Accumulibacter and Competibacter were two primary microorganisms at the genus level in the EBPR system. Accumulibacter decreased seriously for exposure to antibiotics, while Competibacter increased in all experimental reactors especially in combined antibiotics reactor.

AB The present study was aimed at investigating the feasibility of a solar photocatalytic system to degrade toxic materials generated from different activities (e.g., xylene from petroleum refineries, tetracycline from pharmaceuticals factories, and chloropyrifos from constructions and pesticides) using the coupled homogenous-heterogeneous solar photocatalytic process. The system consists of ten Pyrex tubes (25 mm inside diameter and 125 cm long) connected in series and mounted on a parabolic trough collector (PTC) with other associated facilities. Different operating variables were studied to predict the performance of the solar reactor like, pH of solution, loading of heterogeneous catalyst, loading of homogeneous catalyst, H2O2 concentration, and liquid flow rate. The maximum degradations obtained, using coupled heterogeneous-homogeneous solar photocatalytic process, were 100% within 30 min for tetracycline at (Fe2+= 50 mg/l, TiO2 = 100 mg/l, H2O2 = 200 mg/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min), 100% for xylene within 30 min at (100mg TiO2/l, 50mg Fe2+/l, 100 mg H2O2/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min), and for chlopyrifos, a maximum degradation of 100% was obtained within 1.5 h at (150 mg Fe2+/l, 250 mg H2O2/l, and 400 mg TiO2/l, pH = 3 and liquid flow rate = 1000 l/min). Results of this study confirmed the capability of the designed solar system to degrade different types of toxic organics.

AB This study investigates the electrochemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) on a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode under different temperatures, current densities, and sample matrixes. For comparison, a commercial Pt electrode and a lab-prepared PbO2 anode were also tested. The oxidation of DEET on BDD was found to be electrochemically irreversible. The degradation of DEET increased with the increase of current density, but was slightly influenced by temperature (25-75 degrees C). Furthermore, the BDD anode was superior to the Pt and PbO2 electrodes with regard to DEET abatement and total organic carbon (TOC) removal. At 0.75 A/cm(2) and 50 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of DEET oxidation were 5.00 x 10(-3)-8.98 x 10(-3) s(-1) in DEET-spiked 1 M Na2SO4 solution, municipal wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent (MWTPSE), groundwater (GW), and river water (RW), significantly greater than that (4.73 x 10(-4) s(-1)) in DEET-spiked industrial wastewater (IW). The TOC removal in the real environmental matrixes followed the order MWTPSE > GW approximate to RW >> IW. Through electrochemical oxidation, DEET was completely mineralized in the DEET-spiked MWTPSE. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The anti-cancer drug Flutamide (FLUT) is widely used and is of great environmental concern. The solar photo-Fenton (SPF) process can be an effective treatment for the removal of this type of micropollutant. The use of a single addition of 5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ and 50 mg L-1 of H2O2 achieved 20% primary degradation and only 3.05% mineralization. By using three additions of 5 mg L-1 Fe2+, with an initial H2O2 concentration of 150 mg L-1, 58% primary degradation was achieved, together with 12.07% mineralization. Consequently, thirteen transformation products (TPs) were formed. The SPF process was further combined with adsorption onto avocado seed activated carbon (ASAC) as an environmentally friendly approach for the removal of remained FLUT and the TPs. Doehlert design was used to assess the behavior of 13 TPs by optimizing the contact time and the adsorbent mass load. The optimal conditions for removal of FLUT and the TPs were 14 mg of ASAC and a contact time of 40 min. Remained FLUT and the TPs were totally removed using the adsorption process. The mechanisms of adsorption of FLUT and the TPs were strongly influenced by their polarity and pi-pi interactions of the TPs onto ASAC.

AB A quantitative assessment of pharmaceuticals in surface water in Jordan was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to evaluate the occurrence, source and distribution of 18 pharmaceutical compounds. Grab samples were collected in the summer from the effluent of two dams in Jordan. Among all of the pharmaceuticals analyzed, the results showed that 10 pharmaceutical compounds were detected in the effluent of King Talal Dam including 1,7-dimethylxanthine, acetaminophen, amphetamine, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, phenazone, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim. However, four pharmaceutical compounds detected in the effluent of Mujib Dam include 1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, cotinine, phenazone. Moreover, eight pharmaceutical compounds were not detected in both dams (<0.005 mu g/L) including cimetidine, diphenhydramine, MDA, MDMA, methamphetamine, morphine, sulfachloropyridazine and thiabendazole. The results also indicated that the compound detected at the highest concentration levels in King Talal Dam was carbamazepine at concentration of 0.358 mu g/L. It is very clear that the occurrence of pharmaceuticals at King Talal Dam is higher than in Mujib Dam. This is mainly due to the fact that King Talal Dam is receiving runoff water and treated wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), while the Mujib Dam is only receiving surface runoff water. This is consistent with many studies reported in the literature that municipal WWTPs are considered a primary source for the discharge of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into surface waters.

AB Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals are being increasingly used for disease treatment; hence, their distribution and factors influencing them in the aquatic environment need to be investigated. This study observed the effect of human and animal populations, usage, purchasing criteria (prescription vs. non-prescription), and land use to identify the spatio-temporal distribution of eight pharmaceuticals at twenty-four sites of the tributaries of the Han River watershed. In rural areas, the mean concentration (detection frequency) of non-prescription pharmaceuticals (NPPs) was higher (lower) compared to that of prescription pharmaceuticals (PPs); in urban areas, a reverse trend was observed. Pharmaceutical concentrations in urban and rural areas were mainly affected by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and non-point sources, respectively; concentrations were higher downstream (4.9 times) than upstream of the WWTPs. The concentration distribution (according to the target) was as follows: human-veterinary > human > veterinary. Correlation between total concentration and total usage of the pharmaceuticals was high, except for NPPs. Most livestock and land use (except cropland) were significantly positively correlated with pharmaceutical concentrations. Concentrations were mainly higher (1.5 times) during cold seasons than during warm seasons. The results of this study can assist policymakers in managing pharmaceutical pollutants while prioritizing emerging pollutants.

AB Removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is of great importance in wastewater reclamation due to their potent negative impacts on human health. Typical polyamide nanofiltration (NF) membranes are negatively charged, which compromises their rejection rate of positively charged PhACs. Herein, we propose to rationally design a novel thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) NF membrane featuring a dually charged metal organic framework (MOF) to effectively remove both positively and negatively charged PhACs. Ethylenediamine (ED) was grafted to the coordinately unsaturated metal sites inside the MIL-101(Cr). The resulting ED-MIL-101(Cr) contained both strong positively charged amine groups inside its channels and negatively charged carboxyl groups at its surface. This dually charged nature of the MOF nanoparticles enabled the ED-MIL-101(Cr)-containing TFN membrane to achieve high rejection rates ( mostly >90%) for both positively (terbutaline, atenolol, fluoxetine) and negatively charged PhACs (ketoprofen, diclofenac, bezafibrate). At the same time, the ED-MIL-101(Cr) TFN membrane had greatly improved water permeance (140% over the control membrane with MOF loading). Calculations based on density functional theory further confirmed the large energy barrier for the migration of both negatively and positively charged PhACs across the nanochannels of ED-MIL-101(Cr). This study highlights a promising potential of dually charged MOF-TFN membranes for efficient removal of trace organic contaminants in wastewater reclamation.

AB In recent years, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) for the treatment of industrial wastewaters (IWWs) has been repeatedly proposed. However, despite the number of tests reported in literature, only a few of them were conducted on real IWWs. In this study, real pharmaceutical IWWs showing an intense recalcitrant color were treated by PEC and H2O2-assisted PEC (UV/TiO2/Bias and UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias, respectively) on TiO2 meshes having sub-micrometric features obtained by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation. Photolysis (UV), chemical oxidation (H2O2) and H2O2-assisted photolysis (UV/H2O2) were tested in the same reactor for comparison. The configuration UV/H2O2/TiO2/bias showed the best results in term of decolorization efficiency and rate, where decolorization was 55 % (single-step H2O2 dosing) and 44 % (three-step H2O2 dosing), after 2 h of contact time. In the same contact time, UV and UV/TiO2/Bias processes did not give decolorization. A more effective COD removal was measured for the PEC processes, UV/H2O2/TiO2/Bias (-24 %) and UV/TiO2/Bias (-20 %), while COD removal by UV was almost 0 %. Correspondingly, the SOUR values showed that PEC combined with a single-step H2O2 dosage was the most effective configuration, leading to the highest biodegradability of the treated IWW with respect to the other processes. The energy consumption analysis demonstrated that PEC+ H2O2 (single-step dosage) optimized energy costs.

AB The current knowledge on bioaccumulation of emerging contaminants (ECs) in aquatic invertebrates exposed to the realistic environmental concentrations is limited. Even less is known about the effects of chemical pollution exposure on the metabolome of aquatic invertebrates. We conducted an in situ translocation experiment with passive filter-feeding caddisfly larvae (Hydropsyche sp.) in an effluent-influenced river in order to i) unravel the bioaccumulation (and recovery) dynamics of ECs in aquatic invertebrates, and ii) test whether exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of ECs will translate into metabolic profile changes in the insects. The experiment was carried out at two sites, upstream and downstream of the discharge of an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent. The translocated animals were collected at 2-week intervals for 46 days. Both pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) were detected in water (62 and 7 compounds, respectively), whereas in Hydropsyche tissues 5 EDCs accumulated. Overall, specimens from the upstream site translocated to the impacted site reached higher ECs concentrations in their tissues, as a reflection of the contaminants' water concentrations. However, bioaccumulation was a temporary process susceptible to change under lower contaminant concentrations. Non-targeted metabolite profiling detected fine metabolic changes in translocated Hydropsyche larvae. Both translocations equally induced stress, but it was higher in animals translocated to the impacted site. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reverse osmosis (RO) is an important technique for potable water reuse. However, the problem of membrane fouling in RO must be addressed for its widespread use. In this study, fouling in RO was investigated with 2540 membrane elements fed with effluents from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating municipal wastewater. The results of chemical cleaning, elemental analysis for a cross section of the fouled membrane and microwave digestion of the fouled membrane suggested that silica was a major player in the membrane fouling. Also, organic matter present in the MBR effluent (mainly composed of soluble microbial products) was found to play an important role in the evolution of membrane fouling. A unique experimental setup enabled investigation of the interaction between silica and organic matter in the membrane fouling in RO: concentrations of silica and organic matter in the feedwater were manipulated. Remarkable membrane fouling occurred only when feedwater containing both silica and organic matter was filtered. It was found that silica or organic matter alone did not cause severe membrane fouling in the RO. The co -presence of silica and organic matter seems to have synergetic effects that cause severe membrane fouling in RO. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioaugmentation was investigated as a method to decrease the recovery period of anaerobic digesters exposed to a transient toxic event. Two sets of laboratory-scale digesters (SRT = 10 days, OLR = 2 g COD/L-day), started with inoculum from a digester stabilizing synthetic municipal wastewater solids (MW) and synthetic industrial wastewater (WW), respectively, were transiently exposed to the model toxicant, oxygen. Bioaugmented digesters received 1.2 g VSS/L-day of an H-2-utilizing culture for which the archaeal community was analyzed. Soon after oxygen exposure, the bioaugmented digesters produced 25-60% more methane than non-bioaugmented controls (p < 0.05). One set of digesters produced lingering high propionate concentrations, and bioaugmentation resulted in significantly shorter recovery periods. The second set of digesters did not display lingering propionate, and bioaugmented digesters recovered at the same time as non-bioaugmented controls. The difference in the effect of bioaugmentation on recovery may be due to differences between microbial communities of the digester inocula originally employed. In conclusion, bioaugmentation with an H2-utilizing culture is a potential tool to decrease the recovery period, decrease propionate concentration, and increase biogas production of some anaerobic digesters after a toxic event. Digesters already containing rapidly adaptable microbial communities may not benefit from bioaugmentation, whereas other digesters with poorly adaptable microbial communities may benefit greatly.

AB Removal of persistent organic pollutants from water is quite challenging using biological treatment processes in waste water treatment plants. In order to improve the wastewater treatment quality for water reuse, many techniques are developed and the most commonly used is heterogeneous photocatalysis. This work studies the degradation of paracetamol (PAR), which is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical drugs in water, and widely used as an analgesic and antipyretic drug in Algeria. The paracetamol degradation has been carried out via heterogeneous photocatalysis, in a suspended solution of catalyst using a Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPC) reactor and in a fixed bed with immobilized catalyst under natural solar radiation. The degradation performance has been studied under various parameters such as substrate concentration and pH of solution. The degradation efficiency decreased when the initial paracetamol concentration increased from 2.5 mg/L to 20 mg/L. In addition, the selected reactors were found to be competent for the paracetamol degradation with an almost 98-99% removal of PAR. For the CPC reactor with suspended TiO2, the paracetamol elimination reached 98% after 300 min; however, for the ?xed-bed reactor, TiO2 immobilized on cellulose-based paper was utilized, which yielded an almost 99% reduction in the PAR concentration after 90 min only of solar irradiation.

AB Micropollutants are a major concern for aquatic organisms and human health. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are an efficient wastewater treatment and water reuse solution, but their micropollutant removal performances are still not fully determined. Modeling micropollutant behavior in MBRs could help better understand and optimize the removal process. Here we provide detailed explanation on a model of micropollutant removal in MBRs that predicts biodegradation and sorption rates. Parameters were calibrated following an iterative two-step procedure developed in this work and using data from two full-scale plants. The calibrated set of parameters was then used (i) to determine the influence of MBR operating conditions such as the duration of aerobic time and the sludge concentration in bioreactor, on micropollutant removal, and (ii) to better understand micropollutant behavior and removal performances in MBRs in response to sudden changes in operating conditions (rain event, F:M ratio). These predictive simulations showed that increasing sludge concentration in bioreactor can decrease effluent concentrations of most of the micropollutants studied by up to 15%, and increasing the duration of aerobic time decreases effluent concentrations of few organic micropollutants tested by up to 15%. Rain events and F:M ratio can increase effluent concentrations of six out of nine micropollutants tested by more than 15%.

AB Recent studies revealed the benefits of oligotrophic and oxic conditions for the biological removal of many trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during soil-aquifer treatment. These findings indicate an unused tuning potential that might also be applicable in engineered biofiltration systems with drastically reduced hydraulic retention times for an enhanced mitigation of TOrCs during wastewater treatment. This study introduces the novel approach of sequential biofiltration (SBF) for the advanced treatment of secondary effluent using two granular media filters operated in series with an intermediate aeration step aiming for oxic and oligotrophic conditions in the second filter stage. Results from the experiments conducted at pilot-scale confirm a reduced substrate availability and predominantly oxic conditions in the second filter stage of the SBF setup. An increased removal of several TOrCs was observed in an SBF system as compared to a conventional single-stage biofiltration unit operated at the same overall empty bed contact time (EBCT). Short-term tests with varying EBCTs in the first filter stage revealed a high degree of system robustness of TOrC mitigation when confronted with sudden hydraulic load variations. Higher removal of several TOrCs at increased EBCTs in the second filter stage indicates that EBCT might play a crucial role for the degradation of certain compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A promising green strategy for the fabrication of fully biobased chitosan adsorbents for wastewater purification is presented. Nanographene oxide (nGO)-type carbon dots were derived from chitosan (nGOCS) or from cellulose (nGOCL) through a two-step process including microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization and oxidation. Finally, nGO were evaluated as biobased property enhancers in chitosan hydrogel adsorbents. Macroporous chitosan hydrogels were synthesized by cross-linking with genipin, and the incorporation of nGO into these hydrogels was shown to facilitate the cross-linking reaction leading to more robust 3D cross-linked networks. This was evidenced by the increased storage modulus and by the swelling ratio that decreased from 5.7 for pristine chitosan hydrogel to 2.6 for hydrogel with 5 mg/mL nGOCS and 3.3 for hydrogel with 5 mg/mL nGOCL. As a further proof of the concept the hydrogels were shown to be effective adsorbent for the common anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium (DCF). Here, the addition of nGO promoted the DCF adsorption process leading to 100% removal of DCF after only 5 h. The synergistic effect of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking could explain the high adsorption of DCF on the hydrogels. The developed biobased CS/nGO hydrogels are thus promising adsorbents with great potential for purification of trace pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB In-sewer stability of biomarkers is a critical factor for wastewater-based epidemiology, as it could affect the accuracy of the estimated prevalence of substances in the community. The spatiotemporal variations of environmental and biological conditions in sewers can influence the transformation of biomarkers. To date, the relationship between environmental variables and biomarker stability in sewers is poorly understood. Therefore, this study evaluated the transformation of common illicit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in laboratory sewer reactors with different levels of pH, temperature, and suspended solids. The correlations between degradation rates of 14 biomarkers, 3 controlled environmental variables (pH, temperature, and suspended solids concentration), and 3 biological activity indicators (sulfide production rate, methane production rate, and the removal rate of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD)) were assessed using correlation matrix, stepwise regression method, and principal component analysis. The consistent results affirmed the dominant effects of biological activities and pH on biomarker transformation in sewers, particularly for labile compounds, whereas the impact of temperature or suspended solids was less significant. This study enhances the understanding of factors affecting the fate of micropollutants in sewer systems and facilitates the interpretation of WBE results for assessing drug use and public health in communities.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) discharged from wastewater effluents into drinking water resources are of growing concern for human health and the environment. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication and application of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) nanofiltration (NF) membranes with tailored selectivity for effective removal of EOCs from saline wastewaters. The PEM NF membranes were prepared via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of a cationic polymer, i.e., poly(diallyl dimethylammonium chloride), and anionic polymer, i.e., poly(sodium styrenesulfonate). Extensive surface characterization verifies that the fabricated PEM membranes have different pore sizes and surface charge properties depending on the LbL deposition cycle. We evaluated the performance of the PEM NF membranes for the rejection of different salts as well as the retention of representative EOCs, including perfluoroalkyl substances (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and antibiotics (amoxicillin trihydrate and tetracycline hydrochloride). Importantly, the PEM NF membrane coated with four bilayers showed as high as 90% EOC retention, comparable to the widely used commercial NF270 membrane, while allowing high passage of salt, including scale-forming divalent cations (<20% rejections of NaCl and CaCl2). This tailored selectivity of the four-bilayer PEM membrane enables high water flux and reduced inorganic (gypsum) scaling potential compared to the NF270 membrane during treatment of EOC-contaminated wastewaters.

AB Saline lakes are subject to numerous environmental impacts related to human activities, changing the chemical and biological natural conditions of the ecosystem. Sustainable development depends on the conservation of such delicate saline ecosystems, which may hold distinctive biodiversity. Pollution is one of the major threats to surface water bodies, for example by increasing nutrient contents and organic pollutants, including endocrine disrupting chemicals. Microbially mediated redox processes exert a fundamental control on nutrient turnover and contaminant removal. This study examines the influence of land use on the distribution of endocrine disrupting chemicals as well as on the microbial community composition in lacustrine sediments from Petrola saline Lake (SE Spain). The lake is impacted by anthropogenic activities (agriculture, farming, mining and urban wastewater spills). Applying chemical and molecular tools (sequencing of 16S rRNA gene) showed a clear influence of land use on the chemistry and bacterial abundance of the lake sediments. The sampling points closer to wastewater outflows and mining ponds (2635, 2643 and 2650) showed fewer numbers and types of endocrine disrupting chemicals as well as a smaller number of families in the microbial community. These findings improve our understanding of how land use affects both water chemistry and the abundance of organisms responsible for biogeochemical cycles.

AB This research aims to assess the presence of four antibiotic compounds detected in the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the POCTEFA territory (north of Spain and south of France) during the period of 2018-2019, and to relate the removal of antibiotic compounds with the processes used in the WWTPs. The performance of a photocatalytic TiO2/UV-VIS pilot-scale plant was then evaluated for the degradation of selected antibiotics previously detected in urban treated effluent. The main results reflect that azithromycin had the highest mass loadings (11.3 g/day per 1000 inhabitants) in the influent of one of the selected WWTPs. The results also show considerable differences in the extent of antibiotics removal in WWTPs ranging from 100% for sulfadiazine to practically 0% for trimethoprim. Finally, the photocatalytic TiO2/UV-VIS pilot-scale plant achieved the removal of the four antibiotics after 240 min of treatment from 78%-80% for trimethoprim and enrofloxacin, up to 100% for amoxicillin, sulfadiazine and azithromycin. The catalyst recovery via mechanical coagulation-flocculation-decantation was almost total. The Ti concentration in the effluent of the TiO2/UV-VIS pilot-scale plant was lower than 0.1% (w/w), and its release into the environment was subsequently minimized.

AB A select few prescription drugs can be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose when not used as prescribed. Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that expired, unwanted, or otherwise unused portions of most of these drugs be disposed of quickly through a take-back program. If such an option is not readily available, FDA recommends that they be flushed down the sink or toilet. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate the ecological and human-health risks associated with the environmental release of the 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) currently on the FDA "flush list". The evaluation suggests that even when highly conservative assumptions are used-including that the entire API mass supplied for clinical use is flushed, all relevant sources in addition to clinical use of the API are considered, and no metabolic loss, environmental degradation, or dilution of wastewater effluents are used in estimating environmental concentrations-most of these APIs present a negligible eco-toxicological risk, both as individual compounds and as a mixture.

AB ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel method on granular porous natural scoria. Structure and morphology of scoria, synthesized ZnO nanoparticles, and ZnO/scoria nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Approximately 49 mg of nano ZnO was immobilized per gram of scoria. Photocatalytic performance of ZnO/scoria nanocomposite was examined for phenazopyridine and Acid Blue 113 removal from synthetic aqueous solutions under UV irradiation in a continuous open channel reactor. Removal of Acid Blue 113 in pH of 5.5, flow rate of 15 ml/min and Acid Blue 113 concentration of 20 mg/L was obtained 70.78%. Removal of phenazopyridine in pH of 6.0, flow rate of 15 ml/min and concentration of 15 mg/L was obtained 72.55%. Also, prepared photocatalyst was used for treatment of pharmaceutical and textile pollutants from real wastewaters. COD reductions of these wastewaters were 40.55% and 58.25% respectively in their natural pH, 5 ml/min with initial COD of 800 and 510. Results reveal that ZnO/scoria nanocomposite is efficient for photocatalytic removal of pharmaceutical and textile pollutants with reusability. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB The membrane bioreactor (MBR) has recently been the focus of research for the treatment of emerging contaminants such as antibiotics in wastewater. Although the biofilm on membrane in an MBR has been considered a cause of "membrane biofouling", its positive impact on removing pollutants has not been well-studied. This study was designed to investigate the retention effect on the permeation of ampicillin (AMP) by the biofilm coated on cellulose acetate (CA) membrane (commonly used for MBRs) utilizing a novel method based on microbial sensitivity test. The bioflim layer (thickness of 12-16 mu m) increased the resistance of the membrane for AMP permeation by 3-28%. Diffusion appeared to be the main driving force for the mass transfer of AMP across the membrane. Besides, the biofilm increased the retention of AMP by 23% but exhibited similar adsorption capacity with comparison of the suspended activated sludge, which indicates that the compact structure of the biofilm was the major contributor for the added retention effect on AMP by the biofilm-coated CA membrane. This study suggests that biofilm (biofouling) in MBRs increases the retention of small-molecule constituents such as antibiotics. A delicate trade-off between reduced wastewater throughput and increased retention of contaminants should be obtained when an MBR is designed and operated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX), an antidepressant extensively used worldwide is considered an emerging pollutant. The present work intends to investigate for the first time the capacity of a bacterial community containing sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) enriched from an anaerobic sludge to biodegrade and use FLX as sole carbon source, since current literature suggests that this drug is poorly biodegraded being mainly removed by adsorption to sediments, where it persists. FLX was biodegraded under sulphate reducing conditions until reaching its lowest and reliably detectable concentration, when 20 mg/L of the drug was used as sole carbon source, while 66 +/- 9% of 50 mg/L FLX was removed, after 31 days. The initial bacterial population was mainly constituted by Desulfomicrobium and Desulfovibrio whereas during the experi-ments using FLX as unique carbon source a clear shift occurred with the increase of vadinBC27 wastewater-sludge group, Macellibacteroidetes, Dethiosulfovibrio, Bacteroides, Tolumonas, Sulfuricurvum, f_Enterobacteriaceae_OTU_18 that are assumed for the first time as FLX degrading bacteria. Although the main mechanism of FLX removal described in literature is by adsorption, in the results herein presented anaerobic biodegradation appears to play the main role in the removal of the FLX, thus demonstrating the potentialities that the anaerobic processes can play in wastewater treatment aiming the removal of new emerging compounds.

AB The current work is focused on the use of nanofiltration in the removal of micropollutants, specially drugs (diclofenac and ibuprofen) and heavy metal (zinc sulphate and zinc nitrate) from wastewater. The commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membranes (AFC 80, AFC 40, AFC 30) were characterised by demineralised water and the ability of the membranes to reject drugs and zinc(II) was subsequently examined. The influence of the operating conditions on the rejection and the permeate flux was evaluated. The operating conditions tested included the transmembrane pressure (5-30 bar); the effect of the feed concentration on the heavy metals rejection (50-200 mg L-1); the effect of ionic strength on the diclofenac and ibuprofen rejection (0-10 g L-1 NaCl) and the volumetric flow rate (5-15 L min(-1)). It has been shown that increasing the transmembrane pressure increases the intensity of the permeate flow and rejection. Drugs rejection also increases with increasing bulk feed flow rates; however, decreases with increasing ionic strength (NaCl concentration in feed). Experimental data indicated that concentration polarisation existed in the membrane separation process. The stable permeation flux and high rejection of drugs and heavy metals indicated the potential of NF for the recovery of drugs and zinc(II) from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are one the main pollutant of the environment. In the present study, photocatalytic processes using zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) and tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoparticles have been investigated for the feasibility of dexamethasone (DXM) decomposition. The effects of different variables such as solution pH, catalyst dosage, DXM concentration, contact time, and different irradiation sources were investigated. The results showed that the maximum efficiency achieved at pH 3 for both catalyst. Optimum catalyst dosage for WO3 and ZrO2 was 500 and 1500 mg/l, respectively. Maximum degradation was obtained at DXM concentration of 5 mg/l. The investigation of different irradiation sources exhibited that BLB/WO3 process was capable of 100% removal of DXM. Furthermore, approximately of 50% of mineralization of DXM was achieved by Halogen/WO3 in synthetic solutions. The degree of DXM mineralization and process performance in the actual hospital wastewater were also studied which showed lower efficiency than synthetic solution. Moreover, the experimental kinetics data were analyzed using Pseudo-first-order and Pseudo-second-order reactions. The obtained results followed Pseudo-first-order with the highest R-2 value of 0.99 for UV/TiO2. In the actual hospital wastewater, DXM was completely decomposed using halogen/WO3 at a contact time of 100 min.

AB The degradation kinetics, the operational influencing factors, the determination of short-chain organic by-products, the mineralization degree, the evolution of residual toxicity, as well as the treatment of complex matrices were systematically investigated on removal of piroxicam by Electro-Fenton process (EF), due to its persistence and low removal in water matrices. The second order reaction rate constant between piroxicam and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) was determined as (2.19 +/- 0.01) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). It was found that the process was able to almost completely mineralize 0.08 mM piroxicam solution (92% TOC removal) at 6 h treatment. Based on identification of short-chain carboxylic acids, released inorganic ions and the removal of total organic carbon, a schematic proposal of piroxicam degradation by EF treatment was done. The evolution of the acute toxicity of treated piroxicam solution was monitored by Microtox method, showing a significant toxicity reduction at 180 min treatment. Remarkably, piroxicam in simulated urine and hospital wastewater was completely degraded after 120 min of EF treatment. Therefore, the results indicate that the tested EF process constitutes an efficient option for the elimination of piroxicam in aqueous media.

AB Groundwater is essential for human life and its protection is a goal for the European policies. All the anthropogenic activities could impact on water quality.
   Conventional pollutants and more than 700 emerging pollutants, resulting from point and diffuse source contamination, threat the aquatic ecosystem.
   Policy-makers and scientists will have to cooperate to create an initial groundwater emerging pollutant priority list, to answer at consumer demands for safety and to the lack of conceptual models for emerging pollutants in groundwater.
   Among the emerging contaminants and pollutants this paper focuses on organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) mainly released into the environment by domestic households, industry, hospitals and agriculture. This paper starts from the current regulatory framework and from the literature overview to explain how the missing conceptual model for OWCs could be developed.
   A full understanding of the mechanisms leading to the contamination and the evidence of the contamination must be the foundation of the conceptual model. In this paper carbamazepine, galaxolide and sulfamethozale, between the OWCs, are proposed as "environmental tracers" to identify sources and pathways ofcontamination/pollution. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The occurrence of analgesics in the environment can be explained by the fact that they are very popular and in common use, for example: to treat the symptoms of colds, aches and pains or for the treatment of painful diseases of rheumatic and non-rheumatic origin. Analgesic drugs are only partly removed from wastewater using the biological wastewater treatment processes. The photochemical methods are mentioned as a useful tool for the removal of analgesic medicines from the aquatic environment. The elimination of three analgesic drugs: diclofenac, naproxen and ibuprofen from the aquatic environment using UV- and UV/H(2)O(2)-processes was the aim of the study. All experiments were performed in the water with the presence and the absence of the urea as the main urine component. With the presence of urea the values of photo-oxidation rate constants (in the UV/H(2)O(2)-process) varied from 0.22 min(-1) (ibuprofen) to 0.39 min(-1) (diclofenac). The values of the photodegradation rate constants in the solution without urea (in the UV/H(2)O(2)-process) varied from 0.25 min(-1) (ibuprofen) to 0.45 min(-1) (diclofenac). The study showed that naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac may be effectively removed from the aquatic environment (e. g. from the urine) by means of photochemical methods.

SO SUSTAINABILITY

AB Excessive use of detergents in wide industrial processes results in unwanted surfactant pollution. Among them, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) has well-known history to be used in pharmaceutical and industrial applications. However, if discharged without treatment, it can cause toxic effects on living organisms especially to the aquatic life. Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) could be a cost-effective and eco-friendly options for the treatment of wastewater containing SDS. In this study, FTWs mesocosms were established in the presence of hydrocarbons-degrading bacteria. Two plant species (Brachiaria mutica and Leptochloa fusca) were vegetated and a consortium of bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56, Acinetobacter junii strain TYRH47, and Acinetobacter sp. strain CYRH21) was applied to enhance degradation in a short-time. Results illustrated that FTWs vegetated with both plants successfully removed SDS from water, however, bacterial augmentation further enhanced the removal efficiency. Maximum reduction in SDS concentration (97.5%), chemical oxygen demand (92.0%), biological oxygen demand (94.2%), and turbidity (99.4%) was observed in the water having FTWs vegetated with B. mutica and inoculated with the bacteria. The inoculated bacteria showed more survival in the roots and shoots of B. mutica as compared to L. fusca. This study concludes that FTWs have the potential for the removal of SDS from contaminated water and their remediation efficiency can be enhanced by bacterial augmentation.

AB The complex nature of biological reactions in biofilm reactors often poses difficulties in analyzing such reactors experimentally. Mathematical models could be very useful for their design and analysis. However, application of biofilm reactor models to practical problems proves somewhat ineffective due to the lack of knowledge of accurate kinetic models and uncertainty in model parameters. In this work, we propose an inverse modeling approach based on tabu search (TS) to estimate the parameters of kinetic and film thickness models. TS is used to estimate these parameters as a consequence of the validation of the mathematical models of the process with the aid of measured data obtained from an experimental fixed-bed anaerobic biofilm reactor involving the treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The results evaluated for different modeling configurations of varying degrees of complexity illustrate the effectiveness of TS for accurate estimation of kinetic and film thickness model parameters of the biofilm process. The results show that the two-dimensional mathematical model with Edward kinetics (with its optimum parameters as mu(max)rho(s)/Y = 24.57, K-s = 1.352 and K-I = 102.36) and three-parameter film thickness expression (with its estimated parameters as a = 0.289x10(-5), b = 1.55x10(-4) and c = 15.2x10(-6)) better describes the biofilm reactor treating the industry wastewater.

AB This study tested the hypotheses that (1) exposure to treated Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) effluent will induce biological effects in exposed fish that are consistent with environmental estrogen (EE) exposure; and (2) seasonal differences in effluent composition will moderate biological effects. We conducted seven on-site exposures using a mobile laboratory. Total estrogenicity of effluents was 10- to 20-fold higher during spring than in fall. Common EEs including steroid estrogens, alkylphenols, and bisphenol-A were ubiquitous. An unusual spike in total estrogenicity identified a combined sewer overflow event. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) responded to exposure with subtle changes in vitellogenin concentrations and secondary sex characteristics. An opportunity to assess a common carp (Cyprinus carpio) population permanently sustained inside the Stickney WRP revealed pronounced exposure effects, but also the resilience of biological organisms even under long-term exposure. In contrast to other studies, no histopathological changes were found. The mobile exposure laboratory proved capable of maintaining U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-recommended exposure conditions while providing flexibility for rapid deployment at multiple sites with minimal operational disruption. Further studies using this platform hold promise to resolve the convoluted interactions between complex effluents and inherent biological complexity.

AB This study firstly explored the photodegradation of carbamazepine, one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals, with tailored BiPO4 nanomaterials. BiPO4 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were characterized and the results indicated that both the hydrothermal temperature and reaction time influenced the phase, morphology and optical properties of the BiPO4 catalysts, which may further determine their specific photocatalytic performances. The intrinsic microstructure and optical properties reflected the crystal properties of the catalysts to some extent. The BiPO4 prepared at 180 degrees C for 72 h (BPO-180-72) displayed the best photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation, during which carbamazepine was nearly completely eliminated from ultrapure water after 60 min irradiation. The good photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the synergistic effect of monoclinic phase and relatively ordered morphology of the resulting BiPO4. Particularly, the monoclinic phase was firstly proved to be more active than the hexagonal phase for BiPO4 samples. BPO-180-72 removed approximately 72.4% of carbamazepine from lab-prepared simulated wastewater after 60 min irradiation, suggesting the potential application of this material in wastewater treatment. Ten reaction intermediate products were observed and identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and a tentative reaction pathway was proposed. Results indicated that photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals were the main reactive species for the photodegradation of carbamazepine in the system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photolysis of caffeine was studied in solutions of fulvic acid isolated from Suwannee River, GA (SRFA) and Old Woman Creek Natural Estuarine Research Reserve, OH (OWCFA) with different chemical amendments (nitrate and iron). Caffeine degrades slowly by direct photolysis (>170 h in artificial sunlight), but we observed enhanced photodegradation in waters containing the fulvic acids. At higher initial concentrations (10 mu M) the indirect photolysis of caffeine occurs predominantly through reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH.) generated by irradiated fulvic acids. Both rate constant estimates based upon measured OH. steady-state concentrations and quenching studies using isopropanol corroborate the importance of this pathway. Further, OH center dot generated by irradiated nitrate at concentrations present in wastewater effluent plays an important role as a photosensitizer even in the presence of fulvic acids, while the photo-Fenton pathway does not at neutral or higher pH. At lower initial concentrations (0.1 mu M) caffeine photolysis reactions proceed even more quickly in fulvic acid solutions and are influenced by both short- and long-lived reactive species. Studies conducted under suboxic conditions suggest that an oxygen dependent long-lived radical e.g., peroxyl radicals plays an important role in the degradation of caffeine at lower initial concentration.

AB Zinc bacitracin (Zn-Bc) belongs to the group of nonribosomal peptide antibiotics (NRPA), comprising a mixture of non-biodegradable congeners characterized by complex structures containing cyclic, polycyclic, and branched chains. However, reports on the use of AOPs for the degradation of NRPA are non-existent. In this context, the present work investigated the photodegradation of Zn-Bc in aqueous solution by direct photolysis and the UVC/H2O2 process. The effects of the specific UVC photon emission rate and initial H2O2 concentration were studied following a Doehlert-design response surface approach. The results showed that all congeners photolyzed at the highest UVC doses in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, with a calculated quantum yield of 0.0141 mol Zn-Bc mol photons(-1). However, no TOC removal was observed after 120 minutes of irradiation, suggesting the disruption of the peptide bonds in the antibiotic molecules without significant changes in the amino acid residues. The addition of H2O2 substantially accelerated Zn-Bc photodegradation, resulting in a remarkable removal of up to 71% of TOC. Most importantly, the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus could be completely removed by both treatments. These findings point out that the UVC/H2O2 process can be straightly engineered for the treatment of metalloantibiotics-containing wastewater in pharmaceutical facilities.

AB The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in environmental matrices is an ongoing issue. This research project was carried out to increase our understanding of the loading, distribution and potential risk of CECs by sampling large and small tributaries in a specific area of the Delaware River watershed (in northeast USA) that is highly urbanized and significantly impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluents. Fifteen target compounds were selected for analysis based on their high frequency of detection in a previous multiyear study conducted on the Delaware River mainstem. Ten sampling sites were chosen on tributaries receiving numerous municipal and industrial discharges. Sampling locations were above and below potential source discharges. Sampling was designed to assess seasonal differences in CECs loadings. The measured environmental concentrations of the target compounds present a detailed picture of urban and industrial impacts on subwatershed receiving waters. An index of concern ranking system was applied to the sample locations by comparing measured environmental concentrations, existing target compound water quality criteria or predicted no effects levels and developing a concern summary variable. Triclocarban and diphenhydramine demonstrated to be compounds of high relative risk (RR) to the aquatic life of the Pennsylvania tributaries to the Delaware River.

AB Combinations of biological, oxidative and adsorptive advanced treatment technologies in hybrid systems hold promise to result in an improved mitigation of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) from municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. This study investigated potential process combinations including sequential biofiltration, ozonation and activated carbon adsorption and focused on synergies between these treatment steps. Results proved that pre-treatment of WWTP effluent using biofiltration resulted in a significant decrease in ozone demand for the transformation of TOrCs characterized by moderate reaction rate constants with ozone. At similar ozone doses the transformation of TOrCs was increased up to 25% when WWTP effluent was pre-treated by biofiltration compared to the transformation observed in WWTP effluent without pre-treatment. This was explained by the removal of dissolved organic matter during biofiltration (21 +/- 3% DOC and 11 +/- 3% UVA(254)) reducing the competition for ozone. For 12 out of 14 investigated TOrCs biological and biological-oxidative pre-treatment using sequential biofiltration with intermediate aeration or ozonation resulted in a substantial, up to 3-fold increase in treated filter bed volumes until a 10% breakthrough of granular activated carbon adsorbers was observed. Also here, the improved process efficiency was explained by the removal and structural alteration of dissolved organic matter during biological or biological-oxidative pre-treatment of the WWTP effluent.

AB Simultaneous application of solar photo-Fenton and ozonation (SPFO) for the efficient treatment of real wastewaters was studied. Four different industrial effluents were selected for the study: landfill leachate, pharmaceutical effluent and two textile wastewaters, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed technology. SPFO performance was compared with individual processes (either solar photo-Fenton or ozonation), as well as the hybrid Fenton and ozonation treatment. In highly polluted wastewaters, combined strategies led to higher organic matter removal than O-3 and photo-Fenton processes applied individually. Solar light favoured catalyst regeneration, allowing removal efficiencies up to 67% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 62% of total organic carbon (TOC) (in the case of textile wastewaters) using an initial concentration of only 10 mg Fe2+ L-1. The reduction of catalyst consumption, along with the absence of sludge production (since Fe2+ removal from the effluent is not required), led to a significant decrease in operational costs (up to 1.22 (sic) kg(-1) COD removed) when combined Fenton and ozonation was applied under solar light. SPFO results in a versatile, effective and economically efficient technology, thus postulating as a promising alternative for reducing the organic load of highly polluted industrial effluents prior to biological treatment.

AB Antidepressants are gaining public attention because of increasing reports of their occurrence in environment and their potential impact on ecosystems and human health. Continuous input of pharmaceuticals into rivers, through psychiatric hospital or wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) effluent, may cause adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems of the receiving water bodies. This work investigates the occurrence and sources of 8 antidepressants in main stream and tributaries of Huangpu River in Shanghai. The detected concentrations of the selected antidepressants ranged from low nanogram per liter to 42.9 ng L-1 (fluoxetine) in main stream and ranged from low nanogram per liter to 33.7 ng L-1 (fluoxetine) in tributaries. To study the effect of hospital or wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on environment, the upstream and downstream samples were analyzed. Generally, antidepressants had greater concentrations in downstream than that in upstream of the WWTPs or hospitals. It is suggesting that WWTPs and hospitals may introduce pollution into water environment. A preliminary risk assessment was conducted: none of the eight target compounds yielded risk quotient (RQ) values more than 0.1, thus indicating that no adverse effect is expected in water environment. These results will provide background data for future antidepressants pollution control and management in Shanghai, China.

AB The cost-effective and energy-efficient removal of organic micropollutants (MPs) from water and wastewater is challenging. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of porous beta-cyclodextrin polymers (P-CDP) as adsorbents of MPs in aquatic matrixes. Adsorption kinetics and MP removal were measured in batch and flow -through experiments for a mixture of 83 MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g L-1) and across gradients of pH, ionic strength, and natural organic matter (NOM) concentrations. Performance was benclunarked against a coconut-shell activated carbon (CCAC). Data reveal pseudo-second-order rate constants for most MPs, ranging between 1.5 and 40 g mg(-1) min(-1) for CCAC and 30 and 40000 g mg(-1) min(-1) for PCDP. The extent of MP removal demonstrates slower but more uniform uptake on CCAC and faster but more selective uptake on P-CDP. Increasing ionic strength and the presence of NOM had a negative effect on the adsorption of MPs to CCAC but had almost no effect on adsorption of MPs to P-CDP. P-CDP performed particularly well for positively charged MPs and neutral or negatively charged MPs with McGowan volumes greater than 1.7 (cm(3) mol(-1))/I00. These data highlight advantages of P-CDP adsorbents relevant to" MP removal during water and wastewater treatment. (GRAPHICS)

AB Adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC) is an effective treatment step for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater or drinking water. Different test methods are commonly used for evaluating the capability of a GAC depending on the raw material and activation method. Several of these methods have been tested with one GAC and different size fractions obtained by grinding and sieving: batch experiments with two distinct modes of agitation (magnetic stirring and horizontal agitation), laboratory-scale adsorbers (LSA), rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) and differential column batch reactors (DCBR). It was found that magnetically stirred batches and DCBR are well suited for minimizing the effects of film diffusion. However, magnetic stirring reduces the particle size especially for large grains and long experimental periods. For fixed-bed adsorbers (LSA and RSSCT), it was shown that increasing the contact time of the water with the GAC at high throughputs can significantly improve the removal of OMP even after 100,000 bed volumes. However, permeability losses in RSSCT even with tap water have to be considered as a severe drawback. Correlations have been established between the loading achieved in a batch after 24 h and the carbon usage rate (CUR) at which the same loading was reached in an RSSCT. As expected, RSSCT removed OMP more efficiently than batch experiments at the same CUR.

AB This study examined the degradation behavior of polycyclic musks (PMs) and antineoplastic drugs (ADs) and the absorbance spectra of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in municipal wastewater by ozone. Specific ozone doses used in the experiments ranged from 0 to 1 mg O-3/mg dissolved organic matter (DOC). The examined PMs included galaxolide, tonalide, celestolide, traseolide and phantolide. ADs included busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, flutamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen and methotrexate. Strong monotonic albeit nonlinear correlations were found to exist between relative changes of EfOM absorbance at 254 nm (i.e. Delta A(254)/A(254)(0)) and the degradation of the selected PMs and ADs. This result was interpreted based on the concept of the simultaneous oxidation of EfOM and, on the other hand, PMs and ADs. This interpretation showed that PMs were degraded primarily via OH radical attack, with tonalide and phantolide being less reactive compared with the other PMs.ADs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and busulfan were also determined to undergo oxidation by OH radicals. Comparison of the behavior of the radical probe para-chlorobenzoic acid and the examined ADs and PMs allowed evaluating corresponding reaction rate constants for reactions between these species and OH radicals.

AB A scale-up methodology was developed and verified that utilizes bench-scale biofilter results to simulate field-scale (pilot or full scale), flow-through biofilter performance. This methodology builds on recirculating batch reactor methods combined with single-pass flow-through methods at empty bed contact times (EBCTs) equivalent to the field scale. This method allows for control of variables that are often not controllable at the field-scale level, that is, influent primary and secondary substrate concentrations, temperature, and replication. The robustness of the method was verified using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal in one drinking water (DW) and two wastewater (WW) effluents and the removal of 12 trace organic contaminants in one WW effluent. The average absolute difference (delta) between bench- and pilot-scale results for 14 comparisons was 2% for DOC removal. Experimental DOC results were not impacted by the range of biofilter hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) with a WW effluent and a DW effluent, confirming that at Damkohler number II values less than 0.1, the biofilters were reaction rate limited with little contribution from mass transfer. This allows for the use of lower HLRs and shorter filter media depths at the bench scale to yield equivalent EBCTs of field scale. Utilizing bioacclimated media, this bench-scale methodology could expedite biofilter implementation in DW and water reuse treatment plants.

AB Reducing human and ecological risks of groundwater nitrate contamination requires understanding the source of nitrate. Land use practices, such as agriculture and residential development, can increase groundwater nitrate concentrations. This study evaluated a chemical source-tracing suite that paired analysis of agricultural herbicide metabolites and human wastewater constituents. The source-tracing suite was tested in an area subject to nitrate from both agriculture and on-site waste ("septic") systems. Monitoring wells showed that agricultural contamination was deeper (>5 m) in the aquifer consistent with its origin a greater distance from wells and that on-site waste ("septic system") contamination was shallower in the aquifer (<3 m). Repeated sampling of seventeen household wells showed evidence of both agricultural and on-site waste contamination in wells with higher nitrate concentrations. The artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were the only septic system indicators consistently detected. Less persistent compounds, such as caffeine and acetaminophen, were never detected in the household wells indicating they were attenuated over the distance between septic system and well and reducing their utility as a tracer of septic system nitrate. Overall, there was a positive relationship between sucralose, acesulfame and nitrate in wells with low levels of agricultural contamination although the relationship varied between wells.

AB P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCBI) is an important part of the multixeno-biotic resistance (MXR) defense system in aquatic organisms. The main goal of this study was identification of P-gp inhibitors in contaminated sediments using the effect directed analysis (EDA) approach. The samples were collected from the Gorjak creek (Zagreb, Croatia), a recipient of wastewater effluents from the pharmaceutical hidustry. Sediment samples were extracted and fractionated using a two-tiered approach. Resulting nonpolar, medium polar, and polar fractions were tested on the inhibition of P-gp activity using P-gp overexpressing PLHC-1/dox cells and calcein-AM as model substrate. The obtained ECM) values (up to 757 mu g/g, expressed in toxicity equivalents of model P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A) revealed high inhibitory potential of polar 1 fractions of investigated sediments and clearly reflected the impact of pharmaceutical wastewater. P-gp specific ATPase assay and the cytotoxicity modulation experiments with colchicine indicated that most of the observed P-gp inhibition was due to the presence of noncompetitive inhibitors. A detailed chemical analysis by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS) revealed nonionic surfactants, including alcohol polyethoxylates (LAEOs) and polypropylene glycols (PPGs), as the major components of the most active subfractions. Testing of several LAEO and PPG commercial mixtures confirmed their potential to inhibit the fish P-glycoprotein and modulate toxicity of other xenobiotics present in complex environmental samples.

AB We have investigated the occurrence of controlled drugs in two rivers, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and five hospital effluents in Taipei, Taiwan, and report here the concentrations of controlled drugs used as prescription medication or drugs of abuse. Of the target drugs, morphine, codeine, meth-amphetamines and ketamine were observed in significant quantities in hospital effluents, with maximum concentrations of 1240, 378, 260 and 206 and L-1, respectively. The other six compounds (including metabolites) were found at trace levels or below the method detection limits. In addition, the high occurrence in river waters of methamphetamine, codeine and ketamine (maximum values 405, 57, and 341 ng L-1, respectively) indicated the significant prevalence of these controlled drugs. This study demonstrated that effluents from hospitals and clinics and treated WWTP effluents contribute to the controlled substances that eventually reach natural rivers. We hypothesize that the occurrence of controlled drugs in the environment can be attributed to two main sources: (1) substance abuse by individuals and (2) treatment with prescription medication for acute and chronic pain. The presence of these contaminants in the aquatic environment may pose significant risk to aquatic and human life. Further studies are needed for verification and may contribute to the development of sustainable strategies for environmental remediation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urine can be collected separately from the general wastewater with the aim of recycling the nutrients. Urine source-separation not only prevents wasting nutrients but also prevents potentially hazardous micropollutants from entering the wastewater stream and tainting a final fertilizer product. We assessed various urine treatment technologies for their performance to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic steroid hormones, and their human biotransformation products. Removal efficiencies were determined with a combination of bioassays and chemical target analysis. The yeast estrogen screen yielded information on estrogenicity. Specific phytotoxicity and nonspecific baseline toxicity was determined with an algae chlorophyll fluorescence test. Filtration methods, such as nanofiltration and electrodialysis, were highly efficient with respect to toxicity reduction. Micropollutant degradation during biological treatment in a sequencing batch reactor was very compound specific. Ozonation removed the target analytes and the estrogenicity completely, but the baseline toxicity was only reduced by 50-60% depending on the ozone doses. Struvite precipitation produced a very "clean" fertilizer product that is ready to use. The examples show that bioassays and chemical analysis yield complementary information, but are very useful to monitor treatment efficiencies and to assess the ecotoxicological potential of byproducts of urine treatment processes. The results of this study present a method to assess the micropollutant removal efficiency, and therefore, support the choice of an appropriate urine processing technique for real-world applications.

AB In this study, adsorption of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as Diclofenac (DCF) on a commercial carbonaceous aerogel honeycomb monolith (NANOLIT (R)-NQ40) was ascertained. Based on, the overall design of an adsorption treatment should include a feasible regeneration process for the spent adsorbent. In this work, the adsorption/desorption process was ameliorated by coupling of electrochemical technology (anodic/cathodic polarisation). It was determined that the anodic polarisation enhanced the DCF removal and it was related with the applied voltage and the disposition of the electrodes into the bulk solution. Anodic polarisation at optimal conditions (voltage 0.9 V, electrodes gap 2.5 cm and electrolyte concentration higher than 1 mM) provoked an enhancement (around 30%) in the DCF adsorption rate. The spent aerogel regeneration method for the adsorbed or electro-adsorbed DCF was investigated and cathodic polarisation proved to be a viable regeneration alternative attaining the total regeneration of aerogel. The electro-desorption mechanism seemed to be linked to the generation of repulsive intermolecular forces in the aerogel surface. Finally, the sequential electro-adsorption/electro-desorption process was performed in successive cycles. The results confirmed the feasibility of this strategy, maintaining the efficiency with no structural changes in the monolith after several cycles being the electro-reversible adsorption of pollutants on aerogel a promising technology for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients, especially antibiotics, are micropollutants whose continuous flow into hydrological cycles has the potential to mediate antibiotic resistance in the environment and cause toxicity to sensitive organisms. Here, we investigated the levels of selected antibiotics in four wastewater treatment plants and the receiving water bodies. The measured environmental concentrations were compared with the proposed compound-specific predicted no-effect concentration for resistance selection values. The concentration of doxycycline, amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin within the influents, effluents, surface waters and river sediments ranged between 0.2 and 49.3 mu gL(-1), 0.1 to 21.4 mu gL(-1); (<)0.1 and 56.6 mu gL(-1); and 1.8 and 47.4 mu gkg(-1), respectively. Compared to the effluent concentrations, the surface waters upstream and downstream one of the four studied treatment plants showed two to five times higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and sulfamethoxazole. The risk quotient for bacterial resistance selection in effluent and surface water ranged between (<)0.1 and 53, indicating a medium to high risk of antibiotic resistance developing within the study areas. Therefore, risk mitigation and prevention strategies are a matter of priority in the affected areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in coking wastewater are difficult to remove due to their complex composition, poor biodegradability, and toxicity. In this work, the potassium ferrate process and the traditional Fenton process were compared to a combination of the ferrate(VI) and Fenton processes for the purpose of degrading phenanthrene, a typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. A series of laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the chemical reaction kinetics of the ferrate(VI) process and the optimum reaction conditions of ferrate(VI) process and the combined ferrate(VI) and Fenton process. The optimum pH of the ferrate(VI) process was 6, and the apparent activation energy of the reaction was found 29.68kJ/mol. In contrast, the optimum conditions for the combined process was an initial pH of 5 and a molar ratio of PHE:K2FeO4:H2O2 of 1:2:2. Under these conditions, the maximum removal efficiency of the combined process reached 84.01%, increased by 10.35% and 31.4% of the maximum rate achieved in the ferrate(VI) process and the Fenton process, respectively. The combined ferrate(VI) and Fenton process also had the advantage of no additional Fe(II) catalyst being required throughout the whole reaction process, resulting in a relatively low initial cost for the practical application of the combined process.

AB This study explores the enhancement of UV-C tertiary treatment by sulfate radical based Advanced Oxidation Processes (SR-AOPs), including photolytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) and their photocatalytic activation using Fe(II). Their efficiency was assessed both for the inactivation of microorganisms and the removal or micropollutants (MPs) in real wastewater treatment plant effluents. Under the studied experimental range (UV-C dose 5.7-57 J/L; UV-C contact time 3 to 28 s), the photolysis of PMS and PS (0.01 mM) increased up to 25% the bacterial removal regarding to UV-C system. The photolytic activation of PMS led to the total inactivation of bacteria (approximate to 5.70 log) with the highest UV-C dose (57 J/L). However, these conditions were insufficient to remove the MPs, being required oxidant's dosages of 5 mM to remove above 90% of carbamazepine, diclofenac, atenolol and triclosan. The best efficiencies were achieved by the combination of PMS or PS with Fe(II), leading to the total removal of the MPs using a low UV-C dosage (19 J/L), UV-C contact time (9 s) and reagent's dosages (0.5 mM). Finally, high mineralization was reached ( > 50%) with photocatalytic activation of PMS and PS even with low reagent's dosages.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the biological effect of the secondary effluent (SE) of a wastewater treatment plant and reclaimed water treated via ultrafiltration (UF) followed by either reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration or nanofiltration (NF) to be used for environmental use by comparing the results of algal growth inhibition tests of concentrated samples of the SE and permeates of RO and NF with those of six rivers in southern Okinawa Island. Although the SE water had no adverse effects on the growth of the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, it could lead to water quality degradation of rivers in terms of its toxic unit value, whereas the use of RO and NF permeates would not lead to such degradation. The recharge of rivers, into which domestic wastewater and livestock effluents might be discharged in southern Okinawa Island, with reclaimed water subjected to advanced treatment could dilute the concentrations of chemicals that cause biological effects and improve the water quality of the rivers, based on the results of the bioassay using P. subcapitata. Comparing the results of bioassays of reclaimed water with those of the ambient water at a site might be effective in assessing the water quality of reclaimed water for environmental use at the site.

AB Continuous release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) present in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is nowadays leading to the adoption of specific measures within the framework of the Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive). The ozonation process, normally employed for drinking water production, has also proven its potential to eliminate PPCPs from secondary effluents in spite of their low concentrations. However, there is a significant drawback related with the costs associated with its implementation. This lack of studies is especially pronounced regarding the economic valuation of the environmental benefits associated to avoid the discharge of these pollutants into water bodies. For the first time the shadow prices of 5 PPCPs which are ethynilestradiol, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, tonalide and galaxolide from treated effluent using a pilot-scale ozonation reactor have been estimated. From non-sensitive areas their values are -73.73; -34.95; -42.20; -10.98; and -8.67 respectively and expressed in (sic)/kg. They represent a proxy to the economic value of the environmental benefits arisen from undischarged pollutants. This paper contributes to value the environmental benefits of implementing post-treatment processes aimed to achieve the quality standards required by the Priority Substances Directive.

AB A study was conducted in an area in north. Italy, on the effluent of two different sized hospitals and the influent and effluent of the receiving municipal treatment plant of one of the examined hospitals. The aim was to investigate 73 selected pharmaceuticals, belonging to twelve different classes, comparing their occurrence in the effluent directly exiting the hospital with that, mixed with the local urban effluent, at the point of its entry and exit from the treatment plant.
   Consistent differences were found in the concentrations of some antibiotics, analgesics and lipid regulators in the two wastewaters, confirming that hospital effluents should not be considered as possessing the same pollutant nature as urban wastewater. Furthermore, analysis of percentage contributions of the hospital to the treatment plant influent evidences that hospitals represent one of the main sources of pollutants, in particular antibiotics, receptor antagonists and lipid regulators.
   Hence, an environmental risk assessment, performed on the effluent from the hospital and the influent and effluent from the treatment plant, revealed a high risk for 9 pharmaceuticals in hospital effluent and for 4 of the 9 substances in the treatment plant influent and effluent, with antibiotics being the most critical compounds in terms of contribution and potential environmental risk for the hospital.

AB Reclaimed wastewater (RW) is increasingly used to irrigate agricultural land and to alleviate agricultural water shortages worldwide. This usage has resulted in concerns about soil contamination by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the human health risks associated with dietary crop intake. In this study, we systematically analysed the occurrence and accumulation of 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite in soils and various crops (cucumber, eggplant, long bean and wheat) from realistic RW irrigation fields with different irrigation histories (20, 30 and 40 years) in Beijing and evaluated the human health risks associated with the consumption of these crops. The 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.67 to 22.92 ng L-1 in RW, 0.029-28.13 mu g kg(-1) in irrigated soil, and < 0.01-28.01 mu g kg(-1) in crops. The concentrations of N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and triclosan were higher than those of other PPCPs, with respective concentrations of 14.39-31.44 ng L-1 and 15.93-26.23 ng L-1 in RW, 10.92-23.29 mu g kg(-1) and 20.22-28.13 mu g kg(-1) in irrigated soil and 17.92-28.01 mu g kg(-1) and 8.92-14.91 mu g kg(-1) in crops. However, the estimated threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) and hazard quotient (HQ) values revealed that the concentrations of N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and triclosan in crops irrigated with RW should be considered a de minimis risk to human health. The concentrations of 11 PPCPs and one active metabolite in soils and crops and the calculated fruit bioconcentration factors (BCFs) did not display obvious increases associated with the duration of RW irrigation in real agricultural systems (P > 0.05). The concentrations of the studied PPCPs in the RW used for irrigation followed different patterns from the concentrations detected in the irrigated soils and crops. Although the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethazine and trimethoprim in RW were higher than those of many other studied PPCPs, their respective values in the irrigated soils and crops did not display a similar tendency. The uptake and accumulation of PPCPs varied among the crop species (P < 0.05). Although PPCPs were detected in eggplant, long bean and wheat (BCFs: not applicable-1.67, 0.03-1.35 and 0.01-5.01, respectively), PPCPs accumulated at increased levels in cucumber (BCFs 0.03-18.98). The estimated TTC and HQ values showed that the consumption of crops irrigated long-term with RW presents a de minimis risk to human health. However, further studies with more PPCPs and additional crop species need to be conducted, the synergistic effects of chemical mixtures of multiple PPCPs and the toxic effects of PPCP metabolites should be elucidated to obtain more reliable information on the safety of wastewater reuse for irrigation.

AB Background, aim and scope Water is a renewable resource and acceptable quality is important for human health, ecological and economic reasons, but human activity can cause great damage to the natural aquatic environment. Managing the water cycle in a sustainable way is the key to protect natural resources and human health. On a global level, the microbiological contamination of water sources is a major problem in connection with poverty and the United Nations Millennium Development Declaration is an important initiative to handle this problem. In terms of environmental health, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) circulate globally; as they travel long distances, they are found in remote areas far from their original source of application and can cause damage wherever they move to. On a global scale, United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) issued the Stockholm Convention to reduce POPs; in the European Union (EU), one intention of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to reach the good chemical status of waters; beside these regulations, there are other directives in support of these goals. The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the Stockholm Convention and the WFD allows meeting the targets of protection of human and environmental health, which are established in the different directives and how could we approach the targets.
   Materials and methods The aims and scopes of different directives are compiled and compared with the actual quality of water, different approaches of standard settings are compared and potential treatment options are discussed. Results Under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into force in May 2004, governments are required to develop a National Implementation Plan ( NIP) setting out how they will address their obligations under the convention and how they will take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment by the use of best available techniques ( BAT) and application of best environmental practices (BEP). On a European level, the WFD has been in place as the main European legislation to protect our water resources and the water environment of Europe since 2000. It requires managing river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services of any specific water body. Nevertheless, the goals of other directives as for drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological, priority substances and priority hazardous substances (PS/PHS) contamination. Following the detection of substances, a risk assessment with sound effect data needs to be performed also for regulatory decisions and priorisation of measures to remove emerging contaminants. Beside personal care products and industrial contaminants, faecal pollution of recreational waters is one of the major hazards facing users, although microbial contamination from other sources as well as chemical and physical aspects also affects the suitability of water for recreation. As in arid and semiarid areas, wastewater is considered for irrigation with regulatory needs of hygienic and chemical parameters-health-based targets-to avoid the contamination of crops and food. In surface waters, currently, the relationships between physical and chemical properties and the biological state of surface waters were quite well-understood to enable the management of catchments and rivers to achieve ecological quality.
   Discussion Nevertheless, more work is needed to find out the actual impact of the regulations for single chemicals and complex mixtures, in terms of environmental quality standards to achieve a 'good chemical status', on the good biological status. In a next step after the adoption of the list of PS/PHS substances, which also includes the POPs, the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) needs to be adjusted and existing or new treatment options (BATs) should comply with the new requirements of the different directives.
   Conclusions Relevant substances threaten human health and the environment by new effects such as CMR, endocrine-disrupting effects or neurotoxicity which are not yet considered in an adequate way by assessment methods and regulatory standards and the application of abatement technologies. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals helps to control the sources, but WFD, the Stockholm Convention and UWWTD need to be harmonised and a rolling revision process should react on new developments. Finally, to answer the question if the Stockholm Convention and the WFD (2000/60/EC) could reach the target-I would state that they provide a very valuable frame to approach the targets, but there is still way to go to reach them on an EU level and on a global scale, also under the aspects of the Stockholm Convention and the Millennium Development Goals.
   Perspectives The compilation of the goals of different regulations and combined actions will save a lot of administrative efforts and money.

AB At the beginning of the 1970s, the time of the first UN Conference on the Human Environment, most of the major rivers in the developed world were in a parlous state with their natural purification capacity far exceeded by the volume of effluents that they were receiving from both industrial and domestic discharges. Since then there have been radical changes both in environmental governance and our understanding of the issues. During the last 40 years many of the problems of the 1970's caused by effluent discharges have been resolved and a dramatic improvement in the aquatic environment has occurred. However, both incremental advances and step changes in scientific knowledge will continue to create new challenges for effluent management in the decades to come.

AB A predictive approach seems useful to identify pharmaceuticals in the environment and give an idea of overall levels of contamination, so as to restrict monitoring to those molecules most likely to be contaminants. We propose an approach based on two parts. The first is to rank the molecules according to the predicted environmental loads; the second is to refine the list by analysing the pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and comparing the concentrations with levels previously measured in surface water. This approach identified a restricted group of priority pollutants (ofloxacin, furosemide, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, spiramycin, bezafibrate, erythromycin, lincomycin and clarithromycin) in the aquatic environment in Italy, for further studies and monitoring.

AB 3D mesoporous BiOBr microspheres via a one-step solvothermal process without templates were synthesized. The as-synthesized material was characterized by XRD, XPS, FESEM, TEM, UV-Vis and nitrogen adsorption techniques. The photodegradation behavior of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IBP) in aqueous BiOBr suspension was investigated under simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared 3D mesoporous BiOBr microspheres was excellent. IBP photodegradation intermediates were detected by GC/MS analyses, and a detailed reaction pathway was proposed. Luminous bacteria (Vibrio qinghaiensis) toxicity evaluation showed the decrease of the toxicity of the photodegradation intermediates. Based on the results, 3D BiOBr could be a promising catalyst on irradiation by visible light, and even under sunlight.

AB In recent years, because of both lowered discharge limits and reduction of usable water sources, reutilization of water became inevitable. This situation makes the application of advanced water treatment technologies compulsory. In this study, applicability of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) methods was investigated for reuse of industrial wastewater treated with advanced treatment method at organized industrial zone. For this purpose, two NF (HL-GE and DL-GE) and one RO (AG-BWRO) membranes were used at 10 bar of applied pressure. Permeability test revealed that HL membrane exhibited the highest permeability with 7.22 +/- 0.79 L/m(2) h bar of permeability constant followed by AG membrane with a permeability constant of 6.03 +/- 0.25 L/m(2) h bar. Less permeable membrane was DL with a permeability constant of 2.08 +/- 0.11 L/m(2) h bar. In terms of rejection performance, conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-) and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) were rejected by HL membrane with an average rejection of 37.2 +/- 2.1%, 38.6 +/- 2.5%, 72.5 +/- 5.5%, 79.9 +/- 6.1%, 85.4 +/- 1.2%, 86.0 +/- 0.5%, 88.8 +/- 0.3%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 46.0 +/- 0.9%, 27.0 +/- 0.3% 17.9 +/- 1.1%, 64.3 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The respective rejections by DL membrane were 31.1 +/- 0.8%, 31.2 +/- 1.1%, 36.8 +/- 16.4%, 68.2 +/- 7.3%, 81.0 +/- 4.0%, 77.9 +/- 0.7%, 84.7 +/- 07%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 41.0 +/- 04%, 18.4 +/- 1.7%, 14.0 +/- 1.3%, and 45.2 +/- 2.7%. On the other hand, higher water quality was obtained with AG-BWRO membrane. AG-BWRO achieved conductivity, salinity, COD, TOC and color rejections of 96.8 +/- 0.2%, 96.9 +/- 0.1%, 74.7 +/- 2.8%, 90.5 +/- 4.8% and 87.6 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Divalent ions and monovalent ions were rejected by AG-BWRO membrane with an average rejection of higher than 94%. In conclusion, AG-BWRO membrane was found to be the best membrane considering both product water quality and quantity. DL membrane was found to be the worst one among the three membranes investigated in this work. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Addition of external carbon sources to post-denitrification systems is frequently used in wastewater treatment plants to enhance nitrate removal. However, little is known about the fate of micropollutants in post-denitrification systems and the influence of external carbon dosing on their removal. In this study, we assessed the effects of two different types and availability of commonly used carbon sources -methanol and ethanol-on the removal of micropollutants in biofilm systems. Two laboratory-scale moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs), containing AnoxKaldnes K1 carriers with acclimated biofilm from full-scale systems, were operated in continuous-flow using wastewater dosed with methanol and ethanol, respectively. Batch experiments with 22 spiked pharmaceuticals were performed to assess removal kinetics. Acetyl-sulfadiazine, atenolol, citalopram, propranolol and trimethoprim were easily biotransformed in both MBBRs (biotransformations rate constants 410 between 1.2 and 12.9 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)), 13 compounds were moderately biotransformed (rate constants between 0.2 and 2 L g(biomass)(-1) d(-1)) and 4 compounds were recalcitrant. The methanol-dosed MBBR showed higher kw (e.g., 1.5-2.5-fold) than in the ethanol-dosed MBBR for 9 out of the 22 studied compounds, equal k(bio) for 10 compounds, while 3 compounds (i.e., targeted sulfonamides) were biotransformed faster in the ethanol dosed MBBR. While biotransformation of most of the targeted compounds followed first-order kinetics, removal of venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole could be described with a cometabolic model. Analyses of the microbial composition in the biofilms using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that the methanol-dosed MBBR contained higher microbial richness than the one dosed with ethanol, suggesting that improved biotransformation of targeted compounds could be associated with higher microbial richness. During continuous-flow operation, at conditions representative of full-scale denitrification systems (hydraulic residence time = 2 h), the removal efficiencies of micropollutants were below 35% in both MBBRs, with the exception of atenolol and trimethoprim (>80%). Overall, this study demonstrated that MBBRs used for post denitrification could be optimized to enhance the biotransformation of a number of micropollutants by accounting for optimal carbon sources and extended residence time.

AB The global presence of antibiotics in the environment has created concerns about the emergence of antibiotic resistance bacteria and potential hazard to humans and the ecosystem. This work aims to study the removal of levofloxacin, a new generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic from aqueous solutions by enzyme mediated oxidation process and optimization of the conditions thereof by response surface methodology (RSM) using Box-Behnken design (BBD). For this study, experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of independent variables namely, pH, temperature, mediator concentration and antibiotic concentration on the degradation percentage of levofloxacin antibiotic using laccase enzyme derived from Trametes versicolor. The residual levofloxacin concentration was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). On applying the quadratic regression analysis, among the main parameters, it was found that the percentage degradation was significantly affected by all the four variables. The predicted values for percentage degradation of levofloxacin were close to the experimental values obtained and the R-2 (0.95) indicated that the regression was able to give a good prediction of response for the percentage degradation of levofloxacin in the studied range. The optimal conditions for the maximum degradation (99.9%) as predicted by the BBD were: temperature of 37 degrees C, pH of 4.5, mediator concentration of 0.1 mM and levofloxacin concentration of 5 mu g mL(-1). The findings of the study were further extended to study the effect of partially purified enzymes isolated from Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus florida and Pleurotus sajor caju on the degradation of levofloxacin at concentrations ranging from as low as 0.1 to as high as 50 mu g mL(-1) in synthetic wastewater utilizing the optimized conditions generated by BBD. A maximum degradation of 88.8% was achieved with the partially purified enzyme isolated from Pleurotus eryngii at 1 mu g mL(-1) levofloxacin concentration which was at par with the commercial laccase which showed 89% degradation in synthetic wastewater at the optimized conditions. The biodegradation studies were conducted using only 2 units of laccase. Thus, the expensive commercial laccase can be effectively replaced by crude laccase isolated from indigenous macrofungi such as P. eryngii, P. florida and P. sajor caju as a cost effective alternative to degrade levofloxacin present in contaminated wastewater using as low as 2 units of enzyme for a 72 h treatment period.

AB The presence of the antimicrobials triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS)in Fountain Creek, a wastewater-dominated stream, and the Arkansas River, Colorado, USA was measured in the surface water, suspended sediments, and bed sediments during spring runoff (high flow) and summer base flow (low flow) conditions. Fountain Creak is a tributary of the Arkansas River. Passive polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used along with active sampling (water grab samples) to measure and TCS concentrations in these surface waters. The concentration of TCC and TCS, based on POCIS measurements, ranged from 4.5 to 47.3 ng/L and 3.9 to 28.3 ng/L, respectively, at the five sample sites monitored in this study under both flow conditions. The range of concentrations of TCC and TCS in suspended sediments was 0.7-57.3 ng/g and 0.7-13.3 ng/g, respectively, and was closely tied to the quantity of organic carbon in the suspended sediment, which ranged from 1.6 to 14.5%. The quantity of organic carbon in suspended sediment during the summer base flow was influenced by runoff from the burn area of a large forest fire that occurred between the two sampling periods. The primary transport mechanism of TCC and TCS in these surface waters was in the dissolved phase, with 64-99% of TCC and 68-99% of TCS transported in the dissolved phase. The total amount of TCS and TCC in bed-sediments was relatively low, with the maximum amount at any one site being 0.38 +/- 0.15 ng/g TCS and 4.09 +/- 5.26 ng/g TCC. Fountain Creek contributed up to 76% and 69% of the TCC and TCS, respectively, that is transported directly below its confluence with Arkansas River. Fountain Creek drained approximately 3.0 g/day TCS (in spring), 2.9 g/day TCS (in summer) and 1.9 g/day TCC (in spring), 2.0 g/day TCC (in summer) into the Arkansas River, which suggests consistent input of TCC and TCS into Fountain Creek, such as in discharge of treated wastewater that is independent of changing creek flow conditions.

AB Background: This study investigated the oxidation of selected progestagenic steroid hormones by potassium permanganate at pH 6.0 and 8.0 in ultrapure water and wastewater effluents, using bench-scale assays. Second order rate constants for the reaction of potassium permanganate with progestagens (levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, norethindrone and progesterone) was determined as a function of pH, presence of natural organic matter and temperature. This work also illustrates the advantages of using a novel analytical method, the laser diode thermal desorption (LDTD-APCI) interface coupled to tandem mass spectrometry apparatus, allowing for the quick determination of oxidation rate constants and increasing sample throughput.
   Results: The second-order rate constants for progestagens with permanganate determined in bench-scale experiments ranged from 23 to 368 M-1 sec(-1) in both wastewater and ultrapure waters with pH values of 6.0 and 8.0. Two pairs of progestagens exhibited similar reaction rate constants, i.e. progesterone and medroxyprogesterone (23 to 80 M-1 sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 26 to 149 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at pH 6.0 and 8.0) and levonorgestrel and norethindrone (179 to 224 M-1 sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 180 to 368 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at pH 6.0 and 8.0). The presence of dissolved natural organic matter and the pH conditions improved the oxidation rate constants for progestagens with potassium permanganate only at alkaline pH. Reaction rates measured in Milli-Q water could therefore be used to provide conservative estimates for the oxidation rates of the four selected progestagens in wastewaters when exposed to potassium permanganate. The progestagen removal efficiencies was lower for progesterone and medroxyprogesterone (48 to 87%) than for levonorgestrel and norethindrone (78 to 97%) in Milli-Q and wastewaters at pH 6.0-8.2 using potassium permanganate dosages of 1 to 5 mg L-1 after contact times of 10 to 60 min.
   Conclusion: This work presents the first results on the permanganate-promoted oxidation of progestagens, as a function of pH, temperature as well as NOM. Progestagen concentrations used to determine rate constants were analyzed using an ultrafast laser diode thermal desorption interface coupled to tandemmass spectrometry for the analysis of water sample for progestagens.

AB Wastewater (WW) reuse for vegetable crops irrigation is regularly applied worldwide. Such a practice has been found to allow the uptake of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) by plants and their subsequent entrance to the food web, representing an important alternative pathway for the exposure of humans to PhACs, with potential health implications. Herein we report the impacts of the long-term (three consecutive years) WW irrigation of a tomato crop with two differently treated effluents under real agricultural conditions, on (1) the soil concentration of selected PhACs (i.e. diclofenac, DCF; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; trimethoprim, TMP), (2) the bioaccumulation of these PhACs in tomato fruits, and (3) the human risks associated with the consumption of WW-irrigated fruits. Results revealed that the concentration of the studied PhACs in both the soil and tomato fruits varied depending on the qualitative characteristics of the treated effluent applied and the duration of WW irrigation. The PhAC with the highest soil concentration throughout the studied period was SMX (0.98 mu g kg(-1)), followed by TMP (0.62 mu g kg(-1)) and DCF (0.35 mu g kg(-1)). DCF was not found in tomato fruits harvested from WW-irrigated plants during the first year of the study. However, DCF displayed the highest fruit concentration (11.63 mu g kg(-1)) throughout the study (as a result of prolonged WW irrigation), followed by SMX (5.26 mu g kg(-1)) and TMP (3.40 mu g kg(-1)). The calculated fruit bioconcentration factors (BCFF) were extremely high for DCF in the 2nd (108) and 3rd year (132) of the experimental period, with the respective values for SMX (0.5-5.4) and TMP (0.2-6.4) being significantly lower. The estimated threshold of toxicity concern (ITC) and hazard quotients (HQ) values revealed that the consumption of fruits harvested from tomato plants irrigated for long period with the WW applied for irrigation under field conditions in this study represent a de minimis risk to human health. However, more studies need to be performed in order to obtain more solid information on the safety of WW reuse for irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reactions of ozone (O-3) with the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin G (PG) and cephalexin (CP) have previously been found to yield products retaining antibacterial activities. These products are unequivocally identified here as the stereoisomeric (R)-sulfoxides of each parent molecule and characterized by a combination of chemical analysis and an antibacterial activity assay. PG-(R)-sulfoxide, which is similar to 15% as potent as PG itself, is formed in similar to 55% yield, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide, which is similar to 83% as active as CP, is formed with a maximum similar to 34% yield. PG-(R)-sulfoxide is recalcitrant toward further oxidation by O-3, but readily transformed by hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) k(HO center dot)(,app)(N) = 7.4 x 10(9) M(-1)s(-1), pH 7), resulting in quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. In contrast CP-(R)-sulfoxide is degraded by both O-3 and HO center dot (k"(O3,app) = 2.6 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) and k"(HO center dot,app) = 7.6 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), pH 7), leading to quantitative elimination of its antibacterial activity. During ozonation of a secondary municipal wastewater effluent sample (pH 8.1, C-DOC = 4.0 mg/L, [alkalinity] = 3.6 mM as HCO3-) spiked with [PG](0) = 1 mu M, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.15 mu M for O-3 doses up to 100 mu M (4.8 mg/L), but reached 0.47 mu M with 10-mM t-BuOH added as a HO center dot scavenger. In contrast, CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields did not exceed 0.1 mu M for the same wastewater spiked with [CP](0) = 1,mu M in either the presence or absence of t-BuOH, indicating that CP-(R)-sulfoxide transformation is governed primarily by direct reaction with O-3. These findings suggest that, for a given degree of parent compound transformation, PG-(R)-sulfoxide yields would likely be greatest during zonation of wastewaters characterized by low O-3 demands and high HO center dot scavenging rates, whereas CP-(R)-sulfoxide yields would be less matrix-dependent In general, complete deactivation of penicillins during wastewater treatment will likely require higher O-3 exposures than necessary for deactivation of cephalosporins.

AB The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals also produces wastes, mainly wastewaters (WWs). These WWs must be responsibly managed. Sometimes, the organic contents of these WWs are not easily removable in standard WW treatment, hence technical options must be investigated to pretreat such WWs in order to remove or destroy the recalcitrant compounds, mostly the active pharmaceutical ingredients themselves. This contribution from a pharmaceuticals company describes WW assessment and management principles, the search for pretreatment options and several case studies on WW (pre)treatment at some pharma production sites of the Roche Group.

AB The ability of several mesocosm-scale horizontal subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands (CW) to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater was assessed in the winter and summer of 2008. As CWs are generally used as secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment systems, their efficacy was compared when fed from two different primary treatment systems, a sedimentation tank and an anaerobic hydrolysis upflow sludge bed reactor (HUSB). The influence of plants (Phragmites australis) in the CWs and their feeding regime (continuous flow or batch flow) on PPCP removal were also monitored. One of the CWs was replicated and operated simultaneously in Barcelona and Leon, Spain, in order to study the effect of environmental conditions on PPCP removal. All systems operated in the open air. The sedimentation tank offered slightly better removal values throughout the experimental period than the HUSB. The presence of P. australis enhanced the removal of salicylic acid, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate, but only in summer (when plants were more active). The use of a batch flow or a continuous flow made very little difference to PPCP removal efficiency. When the two mesocosm replicates were compared, temperature proved to be one of the most determining parameters affecting PPCP elimination, with naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, caffeine, galaxolide, tonalide and methyl dihydrojasmonate being removed in SSF-CWs more efficiently at higher temperatures. In general, the most easily removed PPCPs in planted CWs were caffeine (14 +/- 74%-84 +/- 7% in winter, 98 +/- 1%-99 +/- 1% in summer), methyl dihydrojasmonate (28 +/- 21%-63 +/- 17% in winter, 93 +/- 2%-98 +/- 1% in summer) and salicylic acid (0%-97 +/- 4% in winter, 41 +/- 40%-89 +/- 9% in summer), followed by naproxen (0%-41 +/- 16% in winter, 60 +/- 18%-95 +/- 4% in summer) and ibuprofen (0%-47 +/- 26% in winter, 35 +/- 12%-99 +/- 1% in summer). Other substances experimented lower removal efficiencies, like ketoprofen (4 +/- 27%-27 +/- 14% in winter, 0%-37 +/- 32% in summer), diclofenac (0%-22 +/- 22% in winter, 0%-71 +/- 8% in summer), carbamazepine (0%-9 +/- 100% in winter, 0%-58 +/- 21% in summer), galaxolide (0% in winter, 25 +/- 14%-87 +/- 5% in summer) and tonalide (0% in winter, 32 +/- 12%-76 +/- 12% in summer).

AB Activated carbon (AC), used for removal of organic micropollutants in European wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), is usually produced from non-renewable resources that need to be transported over long distances. Utilising local residual biomass as a raw material may be advantageous in terms of sustainability. This study investigated the environmental and energy balances of using biowaste and biomass from landscape management for micropollutant removal at a commercial scale WWTP. Both residual biomasses were processed using the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) technique to obtain a press cake that was used as feedstock for AC production. The results showed a lower global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand in comparison to a fossil-based conventional AC Differences in GWP between residual and fossil ACs were enhanced when the end-of-life incineration step was considered, and residual AC had a lower social risk associated with its production. Energy efficiency of AC production was substantially increased by utilising waste heat generated in the pyrolysis process of biochar production and by using electricity generated in a combined heat and power plant using biogas from the methanation of IFBB press fluids. Converting residual biomass into activated carbon using IFBB and a state-of-the-art pyrolysis and activation unit along with energy recovery would improve WWTP sustainability and self-sufficiency in terms of the raw materials required.

AB This study was designed to assess the occurrence and concentrations of a broad range of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from three local estuaries within a large estuarine ecosystem. In addition to effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), we sampled water and whole-body juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) in estuaries receiving effluent. We analyzed these matrices for 150 compounds, which included pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), and several industrial compounds. Collectively, we detected 81 analytes in effluent, 25 analytes in estuary water, and 42 analytes in fish tissue. A number of compounds, including sertraline, triclosan, estrone, fluoxetine, metformin, and nonylphenol were detected in water and tissue at concentrations that may cause adverse effects in fish. Interestingly, 29 CEC analytes were detected in effluent and fish tissue, but not in estuarine waters, indicating a high potential for bioaccumulation for these compounds. Although concentrations of most detected analytes were present at relatively low concentrations, our analysis revealed that overall CEC inputs to each estuary amount to several kilograms of these compounds per day. This study is unique because we report on CEC concentrations in estuarine waters and whole-body fish, which are both uncommon in the literature. A noteworthy finding was the preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon relative to staghorn sculpin, a benthic species with relatively high site fidelity.

AB A fish plasma model (FPM) has been proposed as a screening technique to prioritize potential hazardous pharmaceuticals to wild fish. However, this approach does not account for inter- or intraspecies variability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. The present study elucidated the uptake potency (from ambient water), tissue distribution, and biological risk of 20 pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) residues in wild cyprinoid fish inhabiting treated-wastewater-impacted streams. In order to clarify the uncertainty of the FPM for PPCPs, we compared the plasma bioaccumulation factor in the field (BAF(plasma) = measured fish plasma/ambient water concentration ratio) with the predicted plasma bioconcentration factor (BCFplasma = fish plasma predicted by use of theoretical partition coefficients/ambient water concentration ratio) in the actual environment. As a result, the measured maximum BAF(plasma) of inflammatory agents was up to 17 times higher than theoretical BCFplasma values, leading to possible underestimation of toxicological risk on wild fish. When the tissue blood partition coefficients (tissue/blood concentration ratios) of PPCPs were estimated, higher transportability into tissues, especially the brain, was found for psychotropic agents, but brain/plasma ratios widely varied among individual fish (up to 28-fold). In the present study, we provide a valuable data set on the intraspecies variability of PPCP pharmacokinetics, and our results emphasize the importance of determining PPCP concentrations in possible target organs as well as in the blood to assess the risk of PPCPs on wild fish.

AB The occurrence of two pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen and diclofenac, in a vulnerable karst groundwater system was investigated. The hydrogeology of the karst system was identified by collecting H-3 samples in groundwater over 27 years and by performing tracer tests. The isotopes and tracer data were interpreted by mathematical modeling to estimate the mean transit time of water and to characterize the hydrogeological flow paths in the groundwater system. By this approach, a mean H-3 transit time of 4.6 years for the fissured-porous karst aquifer was determined, whereas the fast flowing water in the conduit system showed a mean transit time of days.
   Both pharmaceuticals which infiltrated along sinkholes and small streams into the karst system were detected in concentrations of up to approximately 1 mu g/L in effluent water of the wastewater treatment plants. Diclofenac was present in most samples collected from four springs discharging the karst groundwater to the rivers Altmuhl and Anlauter in concentrations between 3.6 and 15.4 ng/L In contrast, ibuprofen was rarely detected in groundwater. The results of this study suggest that both pharmaceuticals move into the fractured system of the karst system and go into storage. Thus dilution processes are the dominant control on the concentrations of both pharmaceuticals in the fractured system, whereas biodegradation is likely less important. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The photochemical degradation of tyrosol (TY) in wastewater was investigated by theoretical method. The highly oxidative radicals (center dot OH and SO4 center dot-) were employed to study the TY transformation behaviors and kinetic properties. The center dot OH-addition and H-abstraction reaction mechanisms were predominant for center dot OH and SO4 center dot--initiated reactions, respectively. The rate constants of TY + center dot OH and TY + SO4 center dot- systems were determined as 9.15 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1 )and 3.14 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1) at 298 K. The generated SO4 center dot- from advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) showed good performance for TY degradation in liquid phase. The direct photolysis was also considered in the excited state in order to reveal the photo-excited reaction mechanism. Due to high endothermicity and energy barrier, direct photolysis is difficult to proceed spontaneously compared to indirect photochemical processes initiated by strong oxidative radicals. Halflife values of TY with center dot OH reactions demonstrated that the high concentration of free radicals would significantly shorten the exposure time of TY in water environment. The results of the ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms suggested TY degradation was a mainly less harmful process. However, hydroxylation product P7 (hydroquinone) was a potential developmental toxicant with greater aquatic toxicity than TY, which was an exception to deserve more concern in environment.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been detected in effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants worldwide. The presence of this compound in various water resources even at very low concentrations poses a big threat both to human health and aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the removal of diclofenac from aqueous solution using Fe-Mn binary oxide (FMBO) adsorbents was investigated. FMBO adsorbents were prepared at varying Fe/Mn molar ratios (1:0, 3:1, and 1:1) through simultaneous oxidation and co-precipitation methods. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of important parameters, such as initial DCF concentration, FMBO dosage, solution pH, and Fe/Mn molar ratio, on DCF removal. Acidic to neutral pH conditions were more favorable for DCF adsorption, while increasing initial DCF concentration and adsorbent dosage resulted in higher DCF removal efficiencies for the three oxides. Lower Fe/Mn molar ratio during FBMO synthesis favored higher DCF removals of up to 99% within a wide pH range. Optimization of operating parameters (initial DCF concentration, FMBO dosage, and solution pH) by Box-Behnken design resulted in up to 28.84 mg g(-1) DCF removal for 3:1 FMBO. Freundlich isotherm best described the experimental data, indicating that adsorption occurred on heterogeneous adsorbent surface. Chemisorption was the rate-limiting step of the DCF removal, as best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

AB An efficient chiral liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method has been developed for the determination of metoprolol (MTP) and three of its major metabolites, namely O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha-HMTP) and metoprolol acid (MTPA) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents. The optimized analytical method has been validated with good quality parameters including resolution >1.3 and method quantification limits down to the ng/L range except for MTPA. On the basis of this newly developed analytical method, the stereochemistry of MTP and its metabolites was studied over time in effluent/sediment biotic and sterile microcosms under dark and light conditions and in influents and effluents of 5 different WWTPs. MTP stereoselective degradation was exclusively observed under biotic conditions, confirming the specificity of enantiomeric fraction variations to biodegradation processes. MTP was always biotransformed into MTPA with a (S)-enantiomer enrichment. The results of enantiomeric enrichment pointed the way for a quantitative assessment of in situ biodegradation processes due to a good fit (R-2 > 0.98) of the aerobic MTP biodegradation to the Rayleigh dependency in all the biotic microcosms and in WWTPs because both MTP enantiomers followed the same biodegradation kinetic profiles. These results demonstrate that enantiomeric fractionation constitutes a very interesting quantitative indicator of MTP biodegradation in WWTPs and probably in the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently, our attention has focused on the low level detection of many antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and other organic chemicals in water resources. The limited studies available suggest that urban or rural streams receiving wastewater effluent are more susceptible to contamination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and other organic chemicals at 18 sites on seven selected streams in Arkansas, USA, during March, April, and August 2004. Water samples were collected upstream and downstream from the influence of effluent discharges in northwestern Arkansas and at one site on a relatively undeveloped stream in north-central Arkansas. At least one antibiotic, pharmaceutical, or other organic chemical was detected at all sites, except at Spavinaw Creek near Mayesville, Arkansas. The greatest number of detections was observed at Mud Creek downstream from an effluent discharge, including 31 pharmaceuticals and other organic chemicals. The detection of these chemicals occurred in higher frequency at sites downstream from effluent discharges compared to those sites upstream from effluent discharges; total chemical concentration was also greater downstream. Wastewater effluent discharge increased the concentrations of detergent metabolites, fire retardants, fragrances and flavors, and steroids in these streams. Antibiotics and associated degradation products were only found at two streams downstream from effluent discharges. Overall, 42 of the 108 chemicals targeted in this study were found in water samples from at least one site, and the most frequently detected organic chemicals included caffeine, phenol, para-cresol, and acetyl hexamethyl tetrahydro naphthalene (AHTN).

AB The selection of a coagulant-flocculant agent which, based on the maximum chemical oxygen demand removal, warrants the best performance of the removal system for a very complex high-load chemical-pharmaceutical industry wastewater, is described. A total of 23 coagulants/flocculants was tested, including salts, poly-hidroxyaluminates, synthetic polymers as well as natural gums. In a second stage, some mixing aspects were studied. The effects of the specific impeller, the agitation speed during the coagulation and flocculation stages, and the absence or presence of baffles were evaluated in a six-Place agitation system. The conventional impellers were replaced by the following types of propellers: Rushton, marine, A310 (Lighting), three flat blades, 45 degrees inclined six blades, and conventional flat blade propeller. It was demonstrated that the appropriate coagulation-flocculation system is capable of diminishing the GOD, the apparent color and the dissolved solids up to 40.6, 25.6 and 39.4%, respectively. The best results were observed when using BL-5086, guar gum, Niad II-3, Niad II-4 and locus beam gum. The impeller performance was highly dependent on the agitation speed for each fixed system. With respect to the mixing aspects, it was shown that the selection of the right propeller for the coagulation and flocculation stages is crucial in determining the quality of the treated water, as well as the quantity and quality of the residual sludges generated in the process.

Performance of Ti/RuO2 as a cathode for hydrogen production from contaminated water at low current density having pharmaceutically active compounds was found to be competitive. Stability of Ti/RuO2 as an anode as well as a cathode was found to be satisfactory. Use of kaolin seems to apparently increase the hydrogen production, which is not documented in any previous research.

AB Halogenated aromatic compounds are toxic and carcinogenic. This is the case of 4-chlorophenol (4CP), a priority pollutant found in large amounts in industrial wastewater effluents from pharmaceutical, dye, pulp and paper industries. Long term exposure to 4-CP even at low-concentration is associated to endocrine disruption. Photocatalysis is a promising advanced oxidation process that attains complete degradation of organic pollutants. The use of UV lamps undermines actual photocatalysis application due to the electrical energy requirements. In this frame, the development of visible light photoactive catalysts can overcome these challenges allowing the implementation using affordable light sources like light emitting diodes (LEDs) or natural sunlight. This work is to present the synthesis and use of an alternative photocatalyst that provided eight-fold increase on 4-CP degradation in comparison to commercial TiO2 Degussa P-25. Almost complete removal (99.20%) was achieved with synthesized Fe/N/S-doped TiO2 at 1.0 g L-1 of photocatalyst dose and pH 7.0 for treating 10 ppm of 4-CP.The first-order rate constant, k(LH ) and Langmuir adsorption constant, Ku(LH, )were calculated with values of 0.429 min(-1) and 2.326 ppm(-1), respectively. The Fe/N/S-TiO2. photocatalysts showed an excellent stability maintaining their performance during four cycles of recovery/reuse. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB A novel strain capable of degrading triclosan was isolated from the acclimated activated sludge and identified to be Dyella sp. WW1 based on 16S rDNA analysis. The effect of initial concentration of triclosan (0.2, 1, 5, and 10 mg/L), temperature (15, 25, and 35 degrees C), pH (5, 7, and 9), and additional carbon source on the degradation of triclosan was investigated in a mineral medium. The results showed that Dyella sp. WW1 can use triclosan as sole carbon source and degrade it when initial triclosan concentration was in the range of 0.2-10 mg/L. The optimal condition for Dyella sp. WW1 to degrade triclosan was 15 degrees C and pH 7. TOC removal efficiency was more than 90%. Dyella sp. WW1 can degrade 3,5-dichloro-4-hydrobenzoic via co-metabolism in the presence of triclosan, but cannot degrade trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, and diclofenac. In the presence of glucose, Dyella sp. WW1 firstly utilized glucose to synthesize the biomass and then degraded triclosan. When triclosan concentration decreased to an extent (1.2 mg/L in this study), Dyella sp. WW1 started to use glucose again. The wastewater components did not significantly affect the activity of Dyella sp. WW1 to degrade triclosan. During the biodegradation process, six metabolite products were identified. Based on the metabolites, two degradation pathways were tentatively proposed. In summary, Dyella sp. WW1 could be used for degrading triclosan in the real wastewater.

AB Biodiversities can differ substantially among different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) communities. Whether differences in biodiversity translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services, however, is under active debate. Theoretical considerations predict that WWTP communities with more biodiversity are more likely to contain strains that have positive effects on the rates of particular ecosystem functions, thus resulting in positive associations between those two variables. However, if WWTP communities were sufficiently biodiverse to nearly saturate the set of possible positive effects, then positive associations would not occur between biodiversity and the rates of particular ecosystem functions. To test these expectations, we measured the taxonomic biodiversity, functional biodiversity, and rates of 10 different micropollutant biotransformations for 10 full-scale WWTP communities. We have demonstrated that biodiversity is positively associated with the rates of specific, but not all, micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, one cannot assume whether or how biodiversity will associate with the rate of any particular micropollutant biotransformation. We have further demonstrated that the strongest positive association is between biodiversity and the collective rate of multiple micropollutant biotransformations. Thus, more biodiversity is likely required to maximize the collective rates of multiple micropollutant biotransformations than is required to maximize the rate of any individual micropollutant biotransformation. We finally provide evidence that the positive associations are stronger for rare micropollutant biotransformations than for common micropollutant biotransformations. Together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in biodiversity can indeed translate into differences in the provision of particular ecosystem services by full-scale WWTP communities.

AB For water reuse applications, "tight" nanofiltration (NF) membranes (of polyamide) as an alternative to reverse osmosis (RO) can be an effective barrier against pharmaceuticals, pesticides, endocrine disruptors and other organic contaminants The use of RO in existing water reuse facilities is addressed and questioned, taking into consideration that tight NF can be a more cost-effective and efficient technology to target the problem of organic contaminants. It was concluded that tight NF is an acceptable barrier for organic contaminants because its removal performance approaches that of RO, and because of reduced operation and maintenance (O&M)costs in long-term project implementation Average removal of neutral compounds (including 1,4-dioxane) was about 82% and 85% for NF and RO, respectively, and average removal of ionic compounds was about 97% and 99% for NF and RO, respectively. In addition, "loose" NF after aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR) can be an effective barrier against micropollutants with removals over 90% When there is the presence of difficult to remove organic contaminants such as NDMA and 1,4-dioxane: for 1,4-dioxane, source control or implementation of treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants will be an option, for NDMA, a good strategy is to limit its formation during wastewater treatment, but there is evidence that biodegradation of NDMA can be achieved during ARR.

AB The occurrence of organic pollutants into water resources, including pharmaceutics, personal care products, pesticides, and/or hormones, is a major issue for all biological species. The impacts of these contaminants on both human beings and the environment are not yet fully understood, and the water pollution has raised a major public concern for many worldwide health authorities. In this letter, we propose a new strategy allowing the decontamination of organic pollutants based on polymer-free bionspired materials. A simple incubation of contaminated samples with nucleolipids allows a quantitative decontamination.

AB A submerged photocatalytic membrane reactor (SPMR) was used with suspended and immobilized N-TiO2 under visible irradiation for diclofenac (DCF) removal from wastewater. The effects of initial N-TiO2 concentrations for the SPMR with suspended N-TiO2 were determined for batch processes. Hydrogen peroxide was also coupled with the photocatalytic process. In continuous conditions, a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was combined with the SPMR for enhancing effluent quality. DCF removal by the SPMR with suspended and immobilized N-TiO2 at a low N-TiO2 dosage (0.5 g/L) was not much different between the two systems, but increased with higher N-TiO2 dosages for the reactor with suspended N-TiO2. Coupling H2O2 with the photocatalytic process under visible irradiation enhanced the DCF removal efficiency. In continuous conditions, DCF concentrations in the photoreactor increased during the reaction time, while those in the effluent (RO permeate) were steady for both systems and both processes. The permeate flux in the reactor with suspended N-TiO2 declined faster than in the reactor with the immobilized N-TiO2. Coupling H2O2 with the photocatalytic process yielded more resistant permeate flux rates. The cake layer formed on the microfiltration membrane of the SPMR with suspended N-TiO2 under visible irradiation was denser than others after completing the process.

AB In this study, photocatalytic degradation of synthetic hospital wastewater containing two pharmaceutical contaminants, namely amoxicillin trihydrate (a commonly used antibiotic) and metformin HCl (a widely used diabetic medicine), was carried out using a laboratory-scale photoreactor (200 mL), TiO2 as photocatalyst, and 125 W low-pressure mercury vapour lamp emitting UV rays at 365 nm. The response surface methodology based on face-centred central composite design was used to optimize the independent variables, namely the initial concentrations of contaminants (10-50 mg/L), TiO2 dosage (250-1250 mg/L), initial pH (3-11), and reaction time (30-150 min). Results showed that both amoxicillin and metformin removals were influenced by all the four variables individually and also by the interaction between these variables. Response surface and overlaid contour plots were used to evaluate the optimum conditions. It was found that the maximum removal of amoxicillin (90%) and metformin (98%) could occur when the pH is 7.6, TiO2 dosage is 563 mg/L, and reaction time is 150 min for an initial concentration of the contaminants at 10 mg/L. Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of photocatalytic degradation. Low adsorption of contaminants on TiO2 surface and negligible degradation of contaminants using acetonitrile as solvent suggest that hydroxyl radical attack could be the predominant pathway in the removal process. The COD and TOC analyses of the samples confirmed the mineralization of the compounds to more than 60%.

AB Wastewater effluents are teeming with organisms, nutrients and chemical substances which water treatment processes fail to remove. Among these substances, pharmaceuticals such as antidepressants are a frequent occurrence, and have been reported to lead to severe effects in the physiology and behaviour of non-target marine species across taxa. Venlafaxine (VFX) is one of the most consistently prescribed substances for the treatment of human depressive disorders, acting as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In the present study, the potential effects of this antidepressant on the survival and key behaviours (i.e. movement, aggression and foraging) of white seabream (Diplodus sargus) larvae were addressed. Larvae were submitted to an acute exposure of two different VFX treatments (low concentration, 10 mu gL(-1); and high concentration, 100 mu gL(-1)) for a total of 48h. Sampling took place after 24 and 48h of exposure. Overall, results showed a significant effect of a two-day exposure to VFX in larvae of D. sargus. Survival was significantly reduced by exposure to a high concentration, but behavioural effects of antidepressant exposure were subtle: i.e. increased attack frequency and temporary modulation of capture success. Further research efforts should be directed towards evaluating the potential chronic effects of antidepressants in marine species, if we are to anticipate possible pressures on natural populations, and effectively advice policymakers towards the investment in new and more efficient methods of wastewater treatments.

AB The degradation of erythromycin (ERY) and ethylparaben (EtP) in urban wastewater effluents at low concentration level during ozonation was investigated under different experimental conditions. Both substrates were rapidly eliminated within 2 min at low ozone dose of 0.3 mg L-1 and the experimental data were well fitted in the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The ratio of HO center dot- and O-3-exposure (R-ct) at the inherent pH was found to be 1.9 x 10(-8). The degradation of ERY and EtP was pronounced at pH 8 compared to acidic pH conditions, while the degradation rate of both substrates was found to be matrix depended. It was also shown that both O-3(-) and HO center dot-mediated pathways are involved in the degradation of EtP, whereas the saturated-rich structure of ERY renders it O-3-recalcitrant. Under the optimum O-3 dose, the BrO3- concentration was found to be lower than 10 mu g L-1. Five and fifteen transformation products were elucidated during ERY and EtP oxidation, respectively. The root and shoot inhibition can be attributed to the oxidation products formed upon dissolved effluent organic matter transformation. Escherichia coil harbouring resistance to ERY survived ozonation better than EtP-resistant E. coil. However, neither ERY- nor EtP-resistant E. coli were detected after 15 min of ozonation.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most recalcitrant pharmaceutically active compounds routinely detected in wastewater effluent-impacted environment. Biocatalytic degradation with enzymes such as laccase provides a promising approach for the elimination of CBZ. However, the relatively low redox potential of laccase makes its efficient CBZ degradation difficult. Therefore, an environmentally benign and effective mediator is required. In this study, three natural phenolic compounds, namely p-coumaric acid (PCA), syringaldehyde (SYR), and acetosyringone (ACE), were investigated as redox mediators for the enzymatic removal of CBZ by both free and immobilized laccase. Among the tested mediators, PCA resulted in the optimal CBZ removal performance with 60% removal rate (20 mu M initial CBZ) after 96 h incubation with immobilized laccase in a conventional suspension system. The degradation of CBZ was then carried out in a membrane hybrid reactor with the effluent recirculating through suspended biocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles. The effect of operation parameters including PCA concentrations, initial enzyme activity and operational flux on CBZ removal were investigated. Further CBZ metabolites study identified 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZD), 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxy-CBZ (CBZE) and acridone as the major metabolites of CBZ oxidation by laccase. The toxicity tests determined by algal viability using the fluorometric indicator alamarBlue indicated that the CBZ treatment via the hybrid reactor could effectively remove the toxicity of parent CBZ compound.

TI Estimation of community-wide multi-chemical exposure via water-based

SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL

AB This paper explores the strong potential of chemical mining of wastewater for markers of community-wide intake of wide-ranging harmful chemicals belonging to several usage groups: industrial chemicals, personal care products, pesticides, illicit drugs, lifestyle chemicals and prescription pharmaceuticals as a proxy for multi chemical community-wide exposure. An estimation of chemical intake in five contrasting town/cities based in the Avon River catchment in the South-West UK was undertaken. High-resolution spatiotemporal pharmaceutical prescription databases were used for system calibration, both in terms of biomarker selection and its correction factor, as well as for the overall system performance evaluation, both spatially and temporality. Only metabolism data accounting for phase two metabolism provided correct estimates of pharma intake. Using parent compounds as XCRs (xenobiotic compounds residue) was found to overestimate exposure due to an inclusion of directly disposed (unused) drugs. Spatiotemporal trends in XC intake were observed as a result of occupational exposure (higher bisphenol A (BPA) intake during weekday), and lifestyle choices (higher cocaine and pyrethroid pesticides intake during weekend). WBE is not intended to estimate individual exposure to chemicals. It can however provide estimates at a community level, and as a result, it has the potential to be developed into an early warning system, a powerful tool for large scale screening studies identifying communities at risk and in need of high resolution individual testing at a localised scale.

LA English
DT Article
ID SEQUENCES; QUALITY
AB A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated ZYSR67-Z(T), was isolated from a pharmaceutical wastewater sample collected from a chemical factory in Zhejiang, China. The strain was motile by a single polar flagellum and grew at 4-42 degrees C (optimum, 35 degrees C), pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum, 6.0) and 0-5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2.0%). Based on multilocus sequence analysis using 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD, the strain ZYSR67-Z(T) formed a distinct phylogenetic group in the genus Pseudomonas. The average nucleotide identity values between strain ZYSR67-Z(T) and the closely related 10 type strains of the Pseudomonas species were 75.8-78.6%. The in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values indicated that strain ZYSR67-Z(T) and the type strains of the Pseudomonas shared 21.4-23.1% DNA relatedness. The predominant isoprenoid quinone system was ubiquinone-9 while ubiquinone-8 was present in trace amounts. The major fatty acids (> 10%) identified were C-12(.0), C-16(.0), C-18.1 (omega)7(c) and summed features 3 (C-16(.1) (omega)7(c) and/or iso-C-15.0 2OH). The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content was 62.6 mol%. On the basis of morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, together with the results of phylogenetic analysis, strain ZYSR67-Z(T) was proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, named Pseudomonas pharmafabricae sp. nov.. The type strain is ZYSR67-Z(T) (=CGMCC 1.15498(T) = JCM 31306(T)).

AB The increasing contamination of freshwater with pharmaceuticals, surfactants, pesticides and other organic compounds are of major concern. As these contaminants are detected at trace levels in the environment it is important to determine if they elicit biological responses at the observed levels. In addition to chemical pollutants, there is also a concern for increasing levels of bacteria and other microorganisms in freshwater systems. In an earlier study, we observed the activation of inflammatory systems downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in southern Sweden. We also observed that the water contained unidentified components that were pro-inflammatory and potentiated the immune response in human urinary bladder epithelial cells. In order to determine if these effects were unique for the studied site or represent a common response in Swedish water, we have now performed a study on three WWTPs and their recipient waters in central Sweden. Analysis of immune responses in urinary bladder epithelial cells, monocyte-like cells and blood mononuclear cells confirm that these waters activate the immune system as well as induce pro-inflammatory responses. The results indicate that the cytokine profiles correlate to the endotoxin load of the waters rather than to the levels of pharmaceuticals or culturable bacteria load, suggesting that measurements of endotoxin levels and immune responses would be a valuable addition to the analysis of inland waters.

AB Four simple advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), i.e. heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). sonolysis (US), ozonation (O-3) and H2O2 oxidation, as well as their combinations were investigated in bench-scale for removing the organics present in the reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate from a municipal wastewater reclamation plant. It was observed that the degradation efficiencies reached a plateau after 1 h of reaction, with varying removals of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) up to 52%. The O-3-based AOPs exhibited relative high efficiencies in treating the organics present in the raw RO concentrate. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) coagulation was preferred over activated carbon adsorption as pretreatment process to improve the subsequent AOP treatments of the RO concentrate. Coupling pretreatment with coagulation, the various AOPs could efficiently remove the organics, resulting in an overall DOC removal of 34-68%, a significant improvement in biodegradability (7-20 times), and a decrease of ecotoxicity. Analyses of molecular weight (MW) distribution of the treated RO concentrate revealed that coagulation could remove large MW organics that were AOP-resistant, while AOP treatments could effectively decompose the complex organics into small molecular organics. The results also demonstrated that a simple integrated method. FeCl3 coagulation + photocatalysis (UVC/TiO2), could finally achieve 95% of the organics removal from the RO concentrate within 6 h.

AB The objective of this work was to analyze the applicability of advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) based on the UV/H2O2/Catalyst system for the oxidative degradation of tetracycline (TC) from aqueous solutions. TC is a rather stable pharmaceutical compound and the retrieval methods for its effective decomposition are an extremely urgent problem for the wastewater treatment processes.
   During the experiments, several possible catalytic systems were investigated. It was determined that TiO2 (anatase) and Al2O3 are the most active in the TC oxidative degradation. Using these catalysts allowed to significantly reduce the amount of hydrogen peroxide feed into the oxidation system (using TiO2 - 3 times, Al2O3 - 4 times compared with the reaction stoichiometry), while the degree of TC destruction in both cases was 99,9 %. It is noted that when using TiO2, the oxidation reactions of intermediates occur more slowly, despite the greater amount of hydrogen peroxide in the system and the reduction in COD at 360 s of exposure was only 50 %. At the same time, in the system with Al2O3 as a catalyst, COD decreased by 75 % at 360 s of the experiment. It was determined that the reactions occurring during catalytic oxidation in the different systems under study attribute to the first and pseudo-first order. Conducted toxicological tests showed that, in spite of the complete TC destruction, additional sorption treatment is required for their complete neutralization.
   Based on the conducted experiments, it was concluded that the analyzed methods can be used for water treatment processes.

AB In this work, the performances of ozonation, photolytic ozonation (UV-C/O-3), and photocatalytic ozonation (UV-A/TiO2/O-3) in degrading ozone recalcitrant micropollutants in four different real domestic wastewaters were evaluated in semi-continuous operation, together with the influence of water matrices in the ozone mass transfer and pollutant degradation rates. The (OH)-O-center dot exposure per consumed ozone ratio, defined as R-OH,R-O3, was applied for single ozonation and modified for light-assisted ozonation processes to evaluate and compare the contribution of radical pathway on micropollutants abatement for the different wastewaters studied. R-OH,R-O3 plots presented good fitting (R-2 > 0.95) in two stages, corresponding to different ozone mass transfer regimes, for all cases. Light-assisted ozonation attained higher pollutant degradation for all water matrices compared to single ozonation, although the performance of UV-assisted processes was more sensitive to matrix factors like composition and turbidity. Moreover, the improvement brought by both light-based processes on R-OHO3 values mainly took place during the second stage. Thus, photocatalytic ozonation reached R-OHO3 values higher than double for all wastewaters, compared with single ozonation (between 105% and 127% increase). These values represent a saving of almost half of the overall ozone needs (42%) for the same ozone recalcitrant micropollutant depletion, although it would require the adoption of higher ozone doses than the currently employed for ozonation in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The availability of water resources is limited, and rising consumption has increased pressure on natural resources. Therefore, reclaimed water represents an alternative option for use in urban areas, industry and, in particular, agriculture. Recent research has shown that some pharmaceutical compounds are not fully removed by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may eventually be released into agricultural systems through the application of wastewater-based resources (sludge and effluent).
   The present study develops an intelligent expert system (based on a feed forward neural network trained via an extreme learning machine algorithm) for predicting the carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) content in lettuce tissues irrigated with reclaimed water from WWTPs. This reduces laboratory costs, mitigates the negative impacts on the environment and leads to more effective, safer decisions on the use of reclaimed water in agriculture. The results obtained, which were validated through statistical testing, demonstrate that the intelligent expert system is well calibrated and reliable. Finally, this system was used to predict maps of CBZ and DCF accumulation in lettuce crops if they were watered with effluent from 10 WWTPs located in the Region of Murcia (Spain). In conclusion, our system provides highly accurate predictions of the amount of CBZ and DCF contained in different lettuce tissues (roots and leaves) and the predicted concentrations do not present any health risk.

AB Most of the published studies concerning water and wastewater ozonation for subsequent reutilization or discharge are focused on applying ozone as an advanced treatment process downstream a biological secondary treatment. Ozonation usually shows good performances in improving water quality as shown when monitoring aggregate parameters during ozone treatments. Nevertheless, additional studies related to ozone application on pre-biological treatment stages should be considered for a better understanding of its effects on water quality as well as on the existing process performances. Therefore, the present study investigates the impact of ozone on the organic matter from municipal waste water effluents with the aim to highlight potential benefits depending on the ozone application point. Special focus was made on ozone transfer and kinetics. To do so, aggregate parameters as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), turbidity and absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) were selected to characterize the effluent quality before and after treatment. These parameters provided useful information regarding the extent of oxidation, the changes in aromaticity and in biodegradability of the effluent organic matter (OM). Ozone application to primary effluents displayed a positive impact on aggregate parameters, improving effluent quality. For both type of effluents, the ozone consumption can be classically described by two characteristics which are the immediate ozone demand and the subsequent constant of first order decay. Their evaluation pointed out the major influence of global organic matter parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human antidepressants have been shown to have a wide variety of effects on aquatic mollusks. The antidepressants venlafaxine ("Effexor'') and citalopram ("Celexa'') are human pharmaceuticals detected in effluent from wastewater treatment plants. We report on the acute effects of venlafaxine and citalopram on the attachment ability of two freshwater snails, Leptoxis carinata and Stagnicola (=Lymnaea) elodes. In laboratory experiments, venlafaxine induced significant foot detachment from the substrate in L. carinata at nominal concentrations as low as 313 pgL(-1) (10(-12) M) and in S. elodes at 31.3 ng L-1. Citalopram was equally potent in L. carinata, inducing significant foot detachment in 405 pgL(-1) (10(-12) M), but slightly less potent in S. elodes inducing significant foot detachment in 4.05 mu gL(-1). In all cases of foot detachment from the substrate, snails were not able to reattach while exposed to the drugs. The lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) for venlafaxine (313 pgL(-1)) and citalopram (405 pg L-1) are about 700x and 25,000x, respectively, lower than the concentrations of these two antidepressants recently reported from North American and European wastewater treatment plants. These are the lowest concentrations of any antidepressant reported to have a detrimental effect on any aquatic animal. The possible physiological mechanism of this toxicity and the potential ecological impacts of these and other antidepressants on aquatic snails and their communities are discussed.

AB Reusing treated wastewater can effectively alleviate water shortages and water contamination problems but depends on ensuring the safety of the reclaimed water that is produced. The operating and management conditions for water reclamation plants in China have been changed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China at the end of 2019 to prevent emerging viruses being spread through wastewater treatment processes and the reclaimed water that is produced. Removal of pathogens and trace organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals) in a real water reclamation plant after the start of COVID-19 epidemic was studied. Disinfection byproduct formation caused by chlorine being added to meet disinfection requirements was also assessed. The pathogenic microorganism concentrations in effluent were <2 (most probable number)/L, and the removal rates for most trace organic compounds were >80% when advanced treatments were performed using ozone, ultraviolet light, and chlorine doses of 2 mg/L, 20.5 mJ/cm(2), and 2-3 mg/L, respectively. The main disinfection byproduct produced at a chlorine dose of 2 mg/L and a residence time of 1 h was chloroform (at concentrations <15 mu g/L). The results indicated that the water reclamation processes with modified conditions gave high pathogen and trace organic compound removal rates and reasonably well-controlled disinfection byproduct concentrations.

AB Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used flame retardant yet a persistent pollutant in the environment. In this study, various microporous and mesoporous carbon-based materials were synthesized and their adsorption performance toward TBBPA was systematically evaluated. The adsorbents were characterized by transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption and Zeta potential measurements. TBBPA adsorption over coal-based activated carbon (F300), coconut-shell-based activated carbon (AC) and CMK-3 followed Freundlich adsorption model, while TBBPA adsorption over zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC), single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) could be well described by both Freundlich model and Langmuir model. Compared with F300 and AC, TBBPA diffusion on ZTC and CMK-3 is faster because of their ordered pore structure and higher average pore size. The surface-area-normalized adsorption capacity of TBBPA was higher on ZTC, AC and F300 than on CMK-3, SWNT and MWNT, which can be attributed to the stronger micropore-filling effect with the microporous carbonaceous materials. The presence of humic acids had little effect on TBBPA sorption over ZTC, F300, CMK-3 and AC, while suppressed TBBPA adsorption on SWNT and MWNT were observed. In the column adsorption test, ZTC was capable of continuously treating synthetic wastewater stream, indicating that ZTC had great potential to be used as an effective adsorbent for TBBPA removal.

AB Solutions with 0.65 mM of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid (INH) in 0.050 M Na2SO4 at pH 3.0 were treated by electro-Fenton (EF) and UVA photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes using a cell with a BDD anode and a carbon-PTFE air-diffusion cathode. The influence of current density on degradation, mineralization rate, and current efficiency has been thoroughly evaluated in EF. The effect of the metallic catalyst (Fe2+ or Fe3+) and the formation of products like short-chain linear aliphatic carboxylic acids were assessed in PEF. Two consecutive pseudo-first-order kinetic regions were found using Fe2+ as catalyst. In the first region, at short time, the drug was rapidly oxidized by (OH)-O-au, whereas in the second region, at longer time, a resulting Fe(III)-INH complex was much more slowly removed by oxidants. INH disappeared completely at 300 min by EF, attaining 88 and 94% mineralization at 66.6 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Isonicotinamide and its hydroxylated derivative were identified as aromatic products of INH by GC-MS and oxalic, oxamic, and formic acids were quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC. The PEF treatment of a real wastewater polluted with the drug led to slower INH and TOC abatements because of the parallel destruction of its natural organic matter content.

AB Simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent were successfully achieved using TiO2 microspheres modified with both platinum nanoparticles and phosphates (P-TiO2/Pt) for the first time. The coexistence of platinum and phosphate on the surface of TiO2 microspheres was confirmed by transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. P-TiO2/Pt microspheres showed a significantly higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2 microspheres and TiO2 powders (P25) for the removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluent with the removal ratio of 100%, 58.2% and 48.5% in 200 min, respectively. Moreover, the marked production of hydrogen (photonic efficiency: 3.23 x 10(-3)) was accompanied by the removal of estrogenic activity only with P-TiO2/Pt as photocatalysts. The hydrogen production rate was increasing with decreased DO concentration in secondary effluent. Results of reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluation during P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process showed that O-2(-) and OH were dominant ROS in aerobic phase, while OH was the most abundant ROS in anoxic phase. Changes of effluent organic matter (EfOM) during photocatalysis revealed that aromatic, hydrophobic, and high molecular weight fractions of EfOM were preferentially transformed into non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW fractions (e.g. aldehydes and carboxylic acids), which were continuously utilized as electron donors in hydrogen production process.

AB This study deals with the chemical characterization of hospital effluents in terms of the predicted and measured concentrations of 38 pharmaceuticals belonging to 11 different therapeutic classes. The paper outlines the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches through an analysis of a case study referring to a large hospital. It highlights the observed (and expected) ranges of variability for the parameters of the adopted model, presents the results of an uncertainty analysis of direct measurements (due to samplingmode and frequency and chemical analysis) and a sensitivity analysis of predicted concentrations (based on the annual consumption of pharmaceuticals, their excretion rate and annual wastewater volume generated by the hospital). Measured concentrations refer to two sampling campaigns carried out in summer and winter in order to investigate seasonal variability of the selected compounds. Predicted concentrations are compared to measured ones in the three scenarios: summer, winter and the whole year.
   It was found that predicted and measured concentrations are in agreement for a limited number of compounds (namely atenolol, atorvastatin and hydrochlorothiazide), and for most compounds the adoption of the model leads to a large overestimation in all three periods. Uncertainties in predictions are mainly due to the wastewater volume and excretion factor, whereas for measured concentrations, uncertainties are mainly due to samplingmode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

AB Photodegradation characteristics of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the effectiveness of H2O2 addition for PPCPs photodegradation during UV treatment were examined in this study. Average k (1st order rate constant) value for all the PPCPs investigated increased by a factor of 1.3 by H2O2 addition during UV treatment using biologically treated water (TW) spiked with the 30 PPCPs. Therefore, the effectiveness of H2O2 addition for PPCPs removal during UV treatment in real wastewater treatment process was expected. It could be also known that H2O2 addition would improve photodegradation rates of PPCPs highly resistant for UV treatment such as DEET, ethenzamide and theophylline. UV dose required for 90% degradation of each PPCP was calculated from k values obtained in UV and UV/H2O2 treatment experiments using TW spiked with 30 PPCPs. For UV treatment, UV dose required for degrading each PPCP by 90% of initial concentration ranged from 38 mJ cm(-2) to 5644 mJ cm(-2). indicating that most of PPCPs will not be removed sufficiently in UV disinfection process in wastewater treatment plant. For UV/H2O2 treatment, all the PPCPs except seven PPCPs including cyclophosphamide and 2-QCA were degraded by more than 90% by UV irradiation for 30 min (UV dose: 691 mJ cm(-2)), indicating that H2O2 addition during UV treatment will be highly effective for improving the degradation of PPCPs by UV, even though much higher UV dose is still necessary comparing to for UV disinfection.

AB Despite increasing public concern about air and water pollution risks posed by concentrated animal feeding operation areas (CAFOs), there is little information about bioavailability and ecosystem impacts of agrochemicals used to increase productivity. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of wastewaters originating from beef cattle feeding operation on Daphnia pulex. Specifically, we assessed lethal and chronic sublethal exposure effects using various endpoints including survival, oxygen consumption, morphology, reproduction, and swimming behavior. Exposure assessments (acute and chronic) were performed with ten (10) surface water samples collected from on-site retention ponds designated as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and R (reference site). Surface water samples were diluted to yield five concentrations (stock, 1x, 2x, 3x, and 4x) as treatments and deionized water was used as control. Results showed site-specific and concentration-related effects on toxicity endpoints. Among treatments, significant (p<0.05) increase in mortality rate (for A, E, F, and H) and decreasing total body length and width (for B, C, D, and G) of D. pulex were observed with increasing wastewater concentration. However, treatments did not have significant effect on swimming behavior (average speed) after exposure to the wastewater samples from all sites except for site E. Evidence from this study suggested that surface waters near beef cattle feed yards affected physiological responses in D. pulex and therefore may similarly affect organisms in the surrounding aquatic ecosystems.

AB The present work aims to study the electrochemical (EC) process applied for the removal of contaminants of emergent concern (CECs) from wastewater after secondary treatment and the effect of the process on the total culturable microorganisms. The EC experiments were performed in a cylindrical open reactor with 500 mL of effluent, and a fixed current density of 8 mA/cm(2) was applied through mixed metal oxide electrodes. The experiments were conducted in different sets. In the first round (Set 1), the effluent sample was spiked with three CECs (200 ppb each): caffeine (CAF), carbamazepine (CBZ), and oxybenzone (OXY). For the best treatment period, 6 h, electrodegradation rates ranged from 41 +/- 7% for CAF to 95 +/- 6% for OXY, with an 87% removal of total culturable microorganisms. In the second round (Set 2), aiming to assess EC process efficiency in a more complex CEC mixture, the effluent was spiked with six more CECs (200 ppb each): diclofenac (DCF), triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and ibuprofen (IBU), giving a total of nine CECs. In this case, the EC process allowed decreasing the CEC content by 19-100% (below the limit of detection), depending on the effluent samples, and the culturable microorganisms by 99.98% after a 6 h treatment. By contributing to CEC degradation and microorganism removal, the EC process proved to be a viable remediation and disinfection technology for secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants.

AB The selective extraction and concentration of salt from coal gasification brine (CGB) by nanofiltration membranes is a promising technology to achieve near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification wastewater. To investigate the feasibility of recovery of salts and the interaction of organic compounds, multivalent ions and monovalent ions on the rejection ratio, three nanofiltration membranes (OWNF1, NF270 and Desal-5 DK) with an 1812 spiral-wound module were used in crossflow filtration. The rejection mechanism was analyzed by comparing the rejection performance as a function of the operation pressure (increasing from 1.0 MPa to 2.5 MPa), the concentration (increasing from 10,000 mg/L to 25,000 mg/L) and pH values (increasing from 3.0 to 10.0). The concentrations of anions and cations were determined using an ion chromatographic analyzer and an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer, respectively. The results show that the rejection of sulfate and the chemical oxygen demand were higher than 92.12% and 78.84%, respectively, at appropriate operation, while negative rejection of chloride was observed in the CGB. The decreasing rejection of organic compounds was due to swelling of the membrane pore in high-concentration solutions. Meanwhile, the organic compounds weakened the negative charge of the membrane active layer, consequently decreasing the ion rejection. More than 85% of the sodium chloride could be recovered, indicating that this technology is suitable for resource recovery from CGB and near-zero liquid discharge of coal gasification industry.

AB The relevant environmental hazard related to the presence of pharmaceuticals in water sources requires the development of high effective and suitable wastewater treatment technologies. In the present work, a hybrid process coupling electro-Fenton (EF) process and aerobic biological treatment (Bio-EF process) was implemented for the efficient and cost-effective mineralization of beta-blocket metoprolol (MPTL) aqueous solutions. Firstly, operating factors influencing EF process were assessed. MTPL solutions were completely mineralized after 4h-electrolysis under optimal operating conditions and BDD anode demonstrated its oxidation superiority. The absolute rate constant of MTPL oxidation by (OH)-O-center dot (k(MTPL)) was determined by the competition kinetics method and found to be (1.72 +/- 0.04) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). A reaction pathway for the mineralization of the drug was proposed based on the identification of oxidation byproducts. Secondly, EF process was used as pre-treatment. An increase of BOD5/COD ratio from 0.012 to 0.44 was obtained after 1 h EF treatment, along with 47% TOC removal and a significant decrease of toxicity, demonstrating the feasibility of a post-biological treatment. Finally, biological treatment successfully oxidized 43% of the total TOC content. An overall 90% mineralization of MPTL solutions was achieved by the Bio-EF process, demonstrating its potentiality for treating wastewater containing pharmaceutical residues. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB A microcapillary film reactor (MCF) was adopted to evaluate and compare the removal efficiency of benzoylecgonine (BE), an emerging micropollutant deriving from illicit drug abuse (cocaine), in different aqueous matrices: milliQ water, synthetic and real wastewater and surface water. The removal processes investigated were the direct photolysis with UV radiation at 254 nm, and the advanced oxidation process (AOP) with the same UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide. As a result of the microfluidics approach developed through an innovative experimental apparatus, full conversion of BE was reached within a few seconds or minutes of residence time in the MCF depending on the process conditions adopted. The radiation dose was estimated to be approximately 5.5 J cm(-2). The innovative MCF reactor was found to be an effective tool for photochemical studies, especially when using highly priced, uncommon, or regulated substances. The removal efficiency was affected by the nature of the aqueous matrix, due to the presence of different xenobiotics and natural compounds that act primarily as HO' radical scavengers and secondly as inner UV254 filters. Moreover, nano -liquid chromatography (LC)-high resolution-mass spectrometry analysis was utilized to identify the main reaction transformation products, showing the formation of hydroxylated aromatics during the photochemical treatment.

AB CPKelco ApS, Denmark is the largest pectin plant in the world and the second largest refined carrageenan plant. The products are used for texturising purposes, primarily within the food industry, but also within the pharmaceutical industry. The products are extracted from imported natural raw materials, like dried citrus peel and special seaweed plants. In the production processes a considerable amount of water and energy are used. The excess water from the production processes is led to CPKelco's own WWTP, which is one of the largest industrial WWTPs in Denmark.
   In order to obtain higher process stability and lower energy consumption in the WWTP, CPKelco decided to change the nitrogen removal process from a conventional nitrification/denitrification process to a nitration/denitration process, which comprises an oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and a controlled reduction of nitrite to N-2. Theoretically this process will decrease the oxygen consumption for oxidation by 25% and the use of carbon source for the reduction will be decreased by 40% compared to the conventional process.
   This paper presents and discusses the experiences and results from three year's continuous operation of the nitration/denitration process in an activated sludge plant, and the overall performance results are discussed in relation to the previous results. Accordingly the implementation of the nitration/denitration process was done successfully, and today the plant operates with much higher process stability than obtained before, and even the most stringent effluent requirements for nitrogen can be obtained.

AB The effect of neat and modified nanodiamond (ND) nanoparticles on the structure and performance of PVDF membranes was studied. ND was first oxidized (O-ND) thermally, then silanized (S-ND) using the esterification reaction by vinyltrimethoxysilane, and finally was PVP functionalized (P-ND) via surface initiated free-radical polymerization method. The results of FTIR analysis revealed that PVP was successfully immobilized onto ND nanoparticles. Different percentages of ND and P-ND nanoparticles were then embedded into PVDF membranes. The results showed that the hydriphilicity and water flux of membranes improved as the percentage of nanoparticles increased. Moreover, the number of pores on the surface of PVDF/P-ND membrane increased in comparison to neat PVDF and PVDF/ND membranes even though the pore size distribution curve of PVDF/P-ND membrane was shifted towards smaller pores. In addition, the presence of ND and P-ND nanoparticles within PVDF membranes increased the portion of beta-phase in the PVDF structure which resulted in abrasion and fouling resistant membranes. The performance of neat PVDF, 1.5 wt. % PVDF/ND and 1.5 wt. % PVDF/P-ND membranes was studied in MBR system with pharmaceutical wastewater feed and it was found that antifouling properties PVDF/P-ND membrane were better than that of PVDF/ND membrane.

AB The degradation of a mixture of four pharmaceutical compounds (atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacin and trimethoprim) in distilled water and in a synthetic solution simulating a typical secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant by ozonation, solar TiO2-photocatalytic oxidation and a sequence of both methods has been investigated. Degradation by ozone led to the complete removal of the selected emerging compounds (EC) but an accumulation of ozonation by-products (e.g., phenolic intermediates and carboxylic acids) in solution was observed. The presence of ozone-consuming substances in the synthetic effluent had not a negative impact on the removal of the pharmaceuticals but on their mineralization (TOC removal <8%). By photocatalytic oxidation, the pharmaceutical compounds were completely removed with UVA radiation doses lower than 0.3 kJ per mg EC while about 70% TOC conversion was achieved with a UVA radiation dose of I kJ per mg EC. The presence of organic and inorganic matter in the secondary effluent had a negative impact on the mineralization of pharmaceuticals. Thus, initial TOC removal rate was five times lower when treating the pharmaceuticals in the synthetic effluent compared to distilled water. The application of a sequential ozone - TiO2 solar photocatalytic oxidation treatment allowed complete removal of pharmaceuticals by ozonation and further mineralization of ozonation by-products by the photocatalytic treatment.

AB Phenol is a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound and its biodegradation is very important to meet the environmental regulations. Two bacterial strains capable of utilizing phenol as a sole source of carbon were isolated from the wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics these strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pseudomallei. Both of these strains were very efficient for phenol degradation. R pseudomallei degraded phenol at a maximum concentration of 1500 mg L-1 within seven days with a specific growth rate of 0.013 h(-1) and phenol degradation rate of 13.85 mg L-1 h(-1). Maximum initial concentration of phenol utilized by R aeruginosa was 2600 mg L-1 with 0.016 h(-1) specific growth rate and 26.16 mg L-1 h(-1) phenol degradation rate. Moreover, the effect of various salts i.e., NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4 and K2SO4 on the growth of these strains and phenol degradation rate (at 1000 mg L-1) was studied. In the presence of these salts, R aeruginosa showed up to 1.53 and 1.34 times faster phenol degradation rate and specific growth rate, respectively as compared to P. pseudomallei. In addition, P aeruginosa exhibited higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reduction rates as compared to the strain R pseudomallei. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The mechanisms of elimination of an anticancer drug (cyclophosphamide) by a membrane bioreactor were investigated. The membrane bioreactor was run for 153 days with a sludge retention time (SRT) of 20 days. A removal efficiency of 60% was observed despite some variations in the influent. This removal was higher than reported in most of the studies in the literature. Biodegradation was the predominant removal mechanism and sorption onto sludge could be neglected.

AB The radiation based treatment of amoxicillin trihydrate (AMT) in aqueous solutions was investigated in the present study based on the use of high energy electron beam (EB) and gamma rays (gamma) under different parametric conditions viz. initial concentrations, dose, pH of solution, addition of organic and inorganic additives, H2O2, and various water mediums. Presence of H2O2 exhibits significant effect on the mineralization efficiency of AMT rather than degradation extent. The efficacy of gamma- and EB-irradiation to degrade AMT decreased in wastewater in comparison to surface, ground and ultrapure water. Under both radiation-based treatments, the degradation of AMT followed pseudo-first order rate kinetics and HO center dot was the most active reactive species employed in the degradation of AMT. Remarkably, the k-value of AMT degradation under EB-irradiation was found to be low in comparison to the k-value under gamma-irradiation treatment of AMT. Toxicity assessment revealed that the both gamma and EB-irradiation treated AMT solutions did not acquire any toxicity against all the studied microorganisms when compared to un-treated solution of AMT. Total cost (operational and installation) for the degradation of AMT under gamma- and EB-irradiation was also evaluated. In comparison to gamma-irradiation, the use of EB plants could play an imperious role in near future at pilot and commercial scale for very large volume of real industrial wastewater treatment.

AB On September 14, 2018, Hurricane Florence delivered similar to 686 mm rainfall to a 106 km(2) watershed in coastal North Carolina, USA. A forested land treatment site comprises one third of the watershed wherein municipal wastewater effluent is spray-irrigated onto 8.9 km(2) of forest. This communication provides insight for land treatment function under excess water duress as well as changes in organic chemical composition in on- and off-site waters before (June 2018) and after (September & December 2018) Hurricane Florence's landfall. We compare the numbers and relative abundances of chemical features detected using suspect screening high resolution mass spectrometry in waste-, ground-, and surface water samples. Values for upstream and receiving waters in September were lower than for sampling events in June and December, indicating an expected dilution effect across the watershed. Chemical diversity was greatest for all surfacewater samples in December, but only upstream surface water showed a dramatic five-fold increase in relative chemical abundance. Chemical abundance in on-site water and downstream surfacewater was equal to or lower than the September storm dilution effect. These data suggest that the land treatment system is functionally and hydrologically robust to extreme storm events and contributed to dilution of upstream chemical reservoirs for downstream receiving waters for months after the storm. Similar systems may embody one water reuse strategy robust to the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Effluent from anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) contains ammonia and would require post-polishing treatment before it can be disinfected by chlorine. However, additional post-treatment steps to remove nutrients offset the energetic benefits derived from anaerobic fermentation. The use of chlorine or ozone also promotes concerns associated with disinfection byproducts. This study evaluates UV/H2O2 as a potential strategy suited for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds as well as antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from AnMBR effluent. Our findings indicate that 10 mg/L H2O2 and 61.5 mJ/cm2 of UV fluence are able to achieve a 4-log removal of both Escherichia coli PI7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae L7. However, a higher fluence of 311 mJ/cm2 with the same amount of H2O2 would be required to achieve >90% removal of atenolol, carbamazepine and estrone. The removal of the pharmaceutical compounds was driven by the hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2, while UV exposure governed the inactivation of ARB and ARGs. UV/H2O2 increased overall mutagenicity of the treated wastewater matrix but did not result in any changes to the natural transformation rates. Instead, UV significantly reduced natural transformation rates by means of DNA damage. Overall, UV/H2O2 could be the ideal final disinfection strategy for AnMBR effluent without requiring additional post-treatment prior disinfection.

AB This study evaluates application of three different nanopowder mixtures for decomposition of diclofenac (DCF), one of frequently detected pharmaceutical in wastewater. Analyzed three photocatalytic mixtures ZnO/SnO2, ZnO/TiO2 and ZnO/In2O3 are for the first time used for diclofenac degradation. A set of experiments were performed in order to investigate influence of catalyst concentration (0.10-0.60 mg mL(-1)), initial concentration of diclofenac (0.002-0.010 mg mL(-1)) and pH value (5-9). The increase in the catalyst concentration leads to a decrease in the degradation rate constant, which is the most pronounced in the ZnO/TiO2 and ranges from 0.47 (6) min(-1) to 0.25 (3) min(-1). The influence of pH on efficacy shows completely different effects: ZnO/In2O3 is most effective in alkaline environments, ZnO/TiO2 in neutral environments, while ZnO/SnO2 efficiency is good in both alkaline and acidic environments. Initial concentrations of diclofenac showed a complex effect on the degradation rate. The four dominant intermediates were detected by LC MS/MS technique. In case of all three nanomaterials, intensive degradation was achieved in first 30 minutes. The economical analysis of photocatalytic treatment was provided where the preparation of nanomaterials does not demand high costs and with the highest diclofenac concentration, total operation costs are the lowest (77.14 US$/kWh).

AB The increasing amount of residual pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater has a negative impact on both the environment and human health. In the present study, we developed new cellulose acetate/Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (Mg-Al LDH) nanocomposite membranes as an efficient method to remove pharmaceutical substances from wastewater. The morphology, porosity, surface properties and thermal stability of nanocomposite membranes containing various amounts of nanofiller were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray microtomography (mu CT), contact angle measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The Mg-Al LDH nanofiller showed a high degree of exfoliation in the polymer matrix, evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hydrodynamic properties and adsorption capacity were evaluated with pure water and aqueous solutions of two common drugs, diclofenac sodium (DS) and tetracycline (TC), and the nanocomposite membranes showed an improved permeability compared with neat cellulose acetate. The membrane prepared with 4 wt.% Mg-Al LDH loading exhibited the highest water flux compared with the pure polymer one (529 vs 36 L.m(-2).h(-1)) and a tenfold increase in adsorption capacity for DS. This enhancement is attributed to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged drug molecule and positively charged Mg-Al LDH layers. Conversely, in the case of TC, the increase in adsorption capacity was smaller and was assigned to hydrogen bonding interactions between the drug molecule and the nanofiller.

AB In this work, a carbon nanotube (CNT) electrochemical filter was investigated for treatment of aqueous antibiotics using tetracycline (TC) as a model compound. Electrochemical filtration of 0.2 mM TC at a total cell potential of 2.5 V and a flow rate of 1.5 mL min(-1) (hydraulic residence time <2 s) resulted in an oxidative flux of 0.025 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2). Replacement of the perforated Ti cathode with a CNT cathode increased the TC oxidative flux by 2.3-fold to 0.020 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2) at a total cell potential oaf 1.0 V. Effluent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and disk agar biocidal diffusion tests indicate that the electrochemical filtration process can degrade the TC molecular structure and significantly decrease its antimicrobial activity, respectively. Addition of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) negatively affected the TC electrooxidation because of competition for CNT sorption and electrooxidation sites. At 2.0 V total cell potential, TC spiked (0.2 mM) into drinking water reservoir and wastewater treatment plant effluent samples had an oxidative flux of 0.015 +/- 0.001 and 0.022 +/- 0.001 mol h(-1) m(-2), respectively, and an energy requirement of 0.7 kWh kgCOD(-1) or 0.084 kWh m(-3). These results indicate a CNT electrochemical filter may have potential to effectively and efficiently treat antibiotics in water and wastewater effluent.

AB Pharmaceutical fate in surface water depends on a combination of physical and chemical processes, but currently, little information is available on cumulative dissipation rates in effluent-dominated receiving waters. In this study, dissipation rates were calculated for pharmaceutical compounds in two streams receiving municipal wastewater effluents using results from passive samplers. Seventeen pharmaceuticals were detected at the two sampling locations, and first-order dissipation rates were found to range between 0.03 and -0.02 h-(1), indicating that some compounds were conserved, while others rapidly dissipated over several kilometers downstream of the source.

AB The release of micropollutants in surface water depends on different sources and on different pathways. Through substance flow analysis, this study estimates the annual load of two pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole) in a catchment area, due to different emission pathways: wastewater treatment plant effluent, combined sewer overflows, and runoff from sludge and manure amended soil. It emerged that wastewater treatment plant effluent is the main emission pathway for carbamazepine (98.5% referring to the total released annual load) and land runoff (98%) for sulfamethoxazole.
   The study also investigates the parameters (including manure disposed on the land, removal efficiency and combined sewer overflow flowrate) which mostly influence the results, and those which are affected by higher uncertainty. The most uncertain parameters are those determining the fate of pharmaceuticals once in soil and surface water.
   The study concludes with a comparison between the predicted concentrations in different points of the receiving water body of the two key compounds, modeled with substance flow analysis, and those directly measured in a dedicated sampling campaign. The main discrepancies were found for sulfamethoxazole. Future research focusing on monitoring campaigns under different weather conditions and in different environmental compartments (soil and water) will certainly provide new insights in this kind of study.

AB Antibiotics are routinely used in intensive animal agriculture operations collectively known as Concentrated Animal Feed Operations (CAFO) which include dairy, poultry and swine farms. Wastewater generated by CAFOs often contains low levels of antibiotics and is typically managed in an anaerobic lagoon. The objective of this research is to investigate the uptake and fate of aqueous sulfamethazine (SMN) antibiotic by alfalfa (Medicago sativa) grass grown under hydroponic conditions. Uptake studies were conducted using hydroponically grown alfalfa in a commercially available nutrient solution supplemented with 10 mg/L of SMN antibiotic. Analysis of alfalfa sap, root zone, middle one-third, and top portion of the foliage showed varying uptake rate and translocation of SMN. The highest average amount of SMN (8.58 mu g/kg) was detected in the root zone, followed by the top portion (1.89 mu g/kg), middle one-third (1.30 mu g/kg), and sap (0.38 mu g/kg) samples, indicating a clear distribution of SMN within the sampled regions. The ultraviolet (UV) spectra of parent SMN and translocated SMN identified in different parts of the plant present the possibility of metabolization during the uptake process. Uptake of SMN using alfalfa grown under hydroponic conditions has potential as a promising remediation technology for removal of similar antibiotics from wastewater lagoons.

TI PPCPs removal by aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor

DT Article
DE Granular sludge; PPCPs; Membrane bioreactor; Removal efficiency
AB An aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (GMBR) was applied to the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) wastewater. The influence of granular sludge on five antibiotic and antiphlogistic PPCPs wastewater and the removal effect of methyl alcohol and conventional organic matter were investigated while constantly reducing the density of inflow organic matter. The results showed that the sludge granulation process in the system was rapid but unstable, and that the system exhibits a dissolution-reunion dynamic equilibrium. The reactor demonstrated varying removal effects of PPCPs on different objects. The use of a GMBR was more effective for the removal of prednisolone, naproxen, and ibuprofen; the first two drugs were lower the average removal rate of which reached 98.46 and 84.02 %, respectively; whereas the average removal rate of ibuprofen was 63.32 %. By contrast, the GMBR has an insignificant degradation effect on antibiotics such as amoxicillin, indicating that such antibiotic medicine is not easily degraded by microorganisms, which plays different roles in system operation. Because of the different chemical structures and characteristics of drugs that result in various degradation behavior. During the GMBR granulation process, the value of mixed liquor volatility suspended solids (MLVSS) gradually increases from 1.5 to 4.1 g/L during the GMBR granulation process, and the removal rate of CODCr reaches up to 87.98 %. After reducing the density of organic matter is reduced, the removal rates of NH3-N and TP both reach more than 90 %, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique is considerably effective in the removal of methanol.

AB This work focuses on applying supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) for eliminating residues of pharmaceutical, endocrine-disruptor and pesticide species from the reject of reverse-osmosis-treated secondary municipal wastewater. SCWO, a well-known treatment method for organic sludge and highly concentrated wastewaters, has not yet been investigated with reverse osmosis (RO) retentates of municipal secondary effluents. The results shown here, focusing on batch SCWO of municipal effluent RO retentate spiked with emerging pollutants, demonstrate the potential of utilizing this single advanced-oxidation generic treatment to fully-mineralize the vast variety of organic species encountered in municipal wastewater effluents, while at the same time lowering its total organic carbon concentration by up to 99%. The chosen model pollutants (carbamazepine and 17 beta-Estradiol both in synthetic solution and within a real effluent RO retentate matrix) and the effluent's background organic matter, started to degrade already at subcritical conditions, however near-complete mineralization of the full matrix (including transformation products) was invariably attained only at fully-established supercritical conditions (450 degrees C-540 degrees C). The extreme hydrothermal oxidation conditions applied in this work allowed for simultaneous oxidation of target molecules and background organic species throughout the applied temperature range, while the phenomenon known as "radicals scavenging" by the background organic matter, was not observed. A new technique is introduced in this work for controlling the pressure within semi-batch SCWO experiments.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in treated municipal effluents have the potential to adversely impact exposed organisms prompting elevated public concern. Using transcriptomic tools, we investigated changes in gene expression and cellular pathways in the liver of male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to 5% concentrations of full secondary-treated (HTP) or advanced primary-treated (PL) municipal wastewater effluents containing CECs. Gene expression changes were associated with apical end points (plasma vitellogenin and changes in secondary sexual characteristics). Of 32 effluent CECs analyzed, 28 were detected including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and industrial compounds. Exposure to both effluents produced significantly higher levels of plasma VTG and changes in secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., ovipositor development). Transcript patterns differed between effluents, with <10% agreement in the detected response (e.g., altered production of transcripts involved in xenobiotic detoxification, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were observed following exposure to both effluents). Exposure to PL effluent caused changes in transcription of genes involved in metabolic pathways (e.g., lipid transport and steroid metabolism). Exposure to HTP effluent affected transcripts involved in signaling pathways (e.g., focal adhesion assembly and extracellular matrix). The results suggest a potential association between some transcriptomic changes and physiological responses following effluent exposure. This study identified responses in pathways not previously implicated in exposure to complex chemical mixtures containing CECs, which are consistent with effluent exposure (e.g., oxidative stress) in addition to other pathway responses specific to the effluent type.

AB The mobility and fate of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in natural waters, soil-water systems and wastewater are controlled in part by surface interactions with nanometer (10(-9) m) metal oxide particles. Experiments were performed by mixing solutions of ofloxacin (OFL), a common, fluoroquinolone-class human and veterinary antibiotic, with 25 nm-TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles at different pH conditions. Both sorption and degradation of OFL were observed in the drug-nanoparticle solutions with initial OFL concentrations of similar to 3 to 690 mu M. Though overall isotherm behavior is logarithmic, OFL removal from the solution can be approximated by linear removal coefficients (K-r). At pH 4. K-r = 42 +/- 8 L kg(-1), at pH 6 K-r = 1288 +/- 217 L kg(-1), and at pH 9 K-r = 26 +/- 7 L kg(-1). Rinsing of substrates at pH 4 resulted in desorption of approximately 11% of the original OFL removed from the solution by TiO2 nanoparticles. Less than 1% of the removed OFL at pH 6 was recovered by rinsing the substrate; and, at pH 9 about 39% of the OFL removed by nanoparticles during the initial mixing experiment was desorbed during rinsing.
   Mass spectral analysis of OR solutions after the removal of the solid nanoparticles yielded ions that indicate the presence of de-methylated and de-carboxylated fluoroquinolone species, resulting from the degradation of OFL at the TiO2 surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photo-electro catalysis (PEC) has emerged as an efficient, sustainable, and green technology for the treatment of recalcitrant compounds, where anode plays a critical role. Novel preparation methods for anodes as catalysts should be considered in order to achieve larger active sites and diverse oxidants production, which can directly enhance the degradation performance. Therefore, in this work, a new cheap and green electrode material modification or synthesis method was studied. A graphene-like carbon mesoporous layer and SnO2 layer over TiO2 was produced and it resulted in higher porosity and stability of the electrode. This led to dominating advantage on photo/electrocatalytic activity and degradation performances. Synthesized electrodes attribute better charge separation and it was analyzed by electrochemical characterization. Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide (O-2(-)) radicals were dominant oxidants in the degradation process based on the catalytic and degradation mechanism. However, the synergistic effect of photo and electro-catalytic degradation performances shrank under unoptimized PEC operational parameters. Therefore, the effect of various PEC parameters for the degradation of emerging pollutants was optimized. It was found that 90% degradation of emergent pollutants was achieved at optimized PEC operational parameters within 60 min of reaction time. Intermediates via PEC degradation of emerging pollutants were identified and a possible removal pathway was thus proposed. The three-dimensional SnO2-G-TiO2 electrodes hold great potential for PEC treatment of wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, both CuO nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods were anchored on thermally-exfoliated g-C3N4 nano sheets (denoted as CZ@T-GCN) via isoelectric point-mediated annealing process as a novel nano-photocatalyst towards degradation of amoxicillin (AMOX). The features of prepared materials were characterized using BET, UV-vis DRS, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM, EIS and transient photocurrent techniques. These analyses demonstrated the successful formation of heterojunctions between components of CZ@T-GCN nanocomposite, which reflected in significantly increased electron-hole separation and enhanced degradation of AMOX as compared with pure substances. The investigation of influential operative parameters confirmed that the complete removal of AMOX could be attained under catalytic dosage of 0.9 g L-1 and pH of 7.0 within 120 min simulated sunlight illumination. Generation of OH center dot upon illumination of catalysts was verified by terephthalic acid photoluminescence (TPA-PL) spectroscopy. Also, trapping tests proved that OH center dot and O-2(center dot-) were the major reactive radicals in AMOX decontamination. A novel double Z-scheme mechanism as well as a tentative pathway for fractionation of AMOX by CZ@T-GCN photocatalytic system were proposed in details. Only a marginal decrease in photocatalytic activity occurred after 5 consecutive tests. In an attempt to study the industrial applicability of catalyst, more than 79 % COD and 63 % TOC were eliminated under optimum conditions during 120 min illumination and the biodegradability of treated wastewater was also improved.

TI Reducing the impact of antibiotics in wastewaters: Increased removal of
   mitoxantrone from wastewater by biosynthesized manganese nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Adsorption; Green synthesis; Manganese nanoparticles; Mitoxantrone
AB In recent years, the efflux of antibiotics into the environment has increased due to increased pharmaceutical usage worldwide. This has led to an urgent need for novel methods to sustainably treat wastewaters. In this study, mitoxantrone (MTX) was selected as representative contaminant antibiotic and a green tea extract was used to cleanly synthesize manganese nanoparticles (Mn NPs) for the subsequent removal of MTX from wastewaters with a maximum removal efficiency of 97.4% (97.40 mg g(-1)) in laboratory trials and a removal efficiency of 77.3% in real wastewaters. SEM analysis showed that MTX was uniformly adsorbed onto the negatively charged Mn NPs surface whereas FTIR analysis revealed that chemical attachment of MTX on the surface of Mn NPs was via N-H groups within the MTX molecules. Isothermal adsorption and kinetic studies further confirm that the adsorption of MTX was via a Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model, suggesting that chemisorption was occurring. A mechanism for the Mn NPs based MTX adsorption was proposed, involving a combination of valence bond adsorption, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction and pore -filling. Overall, biosynthesized Mn NPs has significant potential for practical applications in removing MTX from contaminated wastewater due to low material costs and a high MTX adsorption capacity. In addition, the synthetic method used was both environmentally friendly and sustainable involving no use of harsh surfactants or solvents common in more traditional synthetic routes.

AB Partial-filling micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (PF-MEKC) with UV detection was applied for determination of human-based steroids in water samples of Finnish wastewater treatment plants. The samples were purified with solid-phase extraction (SPE) on octadecyl substituted polymer sorbents obtaining analyte enrichment of 20,000-fold. The steroids studied were androgens, estrogens, and progesterone. Three of the steroids could be quantified with the PF-MEKC method. The detection and quantification limits were 0.05-1.06 mu g/mL and 0.15-3.2 mu g/mL, meaning in the SPE concentrates as 2.5-53 pg/L and 7.5-160 pg/L, respectively. In the influent waters, the total amount of testosterone glucuronide, androstenedione, and progesterone was up to 350 ng/L. In effluent water samples the total steroid quantity was maximum at 320 ng/L. Remarkably high quantity of androstenedione was quantified in both influent and effluent water samples. The cleanest effluent waters were produced in Western Finland. Correspondingly, the highest quantities were located near the largest lake and river areas in South-Eastern Finland. The concentration variation in effluent waters was explained with differences in the purification materials and processes at the plants and with steroid adsorption on soil and organic material suspended into water.

AB This work reports the novel application of an Fe-based 2D metal-organic framework (MOF), prepared with 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate (bpydc) as organic linker, as highly active catalyst for heteroge-neous photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) treatment of the lipid regulator bezafibrate in a model matrix and urban wastewater. Well-dispersed 2D structures were successfully synthesized and their morphological, physicochemical and photocatalytic properties were assessed. UV/Vis PEF using an IrO2/air-diffusion cell with an extremely low catalyst concentration (0.05 g L-1, tenfold lower than reported 3D MOFs) outperformed electro-oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2, electro-Fenton and visible-light PEF. Its excellent performance was explained by: (i) the enhanced mass transport of H2O2 (and organic molecules) at the 2D structure, providing active sites for heterogeneous Fenton's reaction and in-situ Fe(II) regeneration; (ii) the ability of photoinduced electrons to reduce H2O2 to (OH)-O-center dot, and Fe(III) to Fe(II); and (iii) the enhanced charge transfer and excitation of Fe-O clusters, which increased the number of electron-hole pairs. LC-QToF-MS and GC-MS allowed the identification of 16 aromatic products of bezafibrate. The complete removal of four micropollutants mixed in urban wastewater at pH 7.4 revealed the great potential of (Fe-bpydc)-catalyzed PEF process. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four horizontal subsurface flow pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) named as S1, S2, M1 and M2 were constructed to treat aquaculture wastewater. And two different plant species (Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) were cultivated in single and mixed planting patterns in these four CWs. The removal rate of conventional pollutants (nutrient and organic compounds), antibiotics including enrofloxacin (ENR), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were evaluated among those CWs. The total nitrogen and NH4+-N removal rates of all CWs were 73.24%-91.46% and 61.20%-92.27%, respectively. CWs with mixed planting patterns, such as M1 (planted with Iris pseudacorus at the forepart and Phragmites australis at the back) and M2 (alternate cultivation with Iris pseudacorus and Phragmites australis) showed better performances than CWs planted with single plant species, such as S1 (Iris pseudacorus) and S2 (Phragmites australis). However, S1 and S2 exhibited higher removal efficiencies for emerging contaminants: S1 had removal efficiencies of 77.64%, 68.70%, and 58.21% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively, and S2 had removal efficiencies of 81.11%, 64.94%, and 56.26% for ENR, SMZ, and total ARGs, respectively. Compared with single planting, the dominant genera in mixed planting exhibited lower relative abundance in anaerobes and higher percent of bacteria associated with nitrogen metabolism, indicating that different plant physiological characteristics affected the microbial community structures of the CWs.

AB Removal of the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which commonly pollute wastewater has been observed upon incubation with white-rot fungi. To date, there is no consensus on what is the optimal fungal source for the enzymes that catalyze remediation of EDCs. Herein, two white-rot fungi cultures (Lentinula edodes and Phanerochaete chrysosporium) were tested for an ability to remove the pollutant 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Mass spectrometry indicates a moderate removal of EE2 for simple potato dextrose cultures of both fungi within one week (50% EE2 remaining in L. edodes; 57% remaining in P. chrysosporium). Due to an absence of measured laccase activity from P. chrysosporium, it was hypothesized that the improved EE2 remediation in L. edodes was due to laccase. Supplementation of L. edodes cultures that improve production of laccase exhibit a corresponding increased ability to remove EE2 (20% EE2 remaining). P. chrysosporium cultures did not respond to supplementation accordingly (48% remaining). Consistent with laccase-specific remediation by L. edodes, incubations of EE2 in the presence of a purified laccase produced identical mass spectra to those observed from L. edodes cultures. The dominant soluble product observed for each has a mass consistent with hydroxylated EE2 (m/z 313). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of EE2 remediation by L. edodes culture. In addition, data indicate that the removal of EE2 is improved by increased production of the high-activity laccase secreted by the fungus.

AB Intense reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture is practiced all over the world, especially in arid and water-scarce regions. In doing so, pharmaceutical residues in the water are irrigated to the soil and subsequently can percolate into the local aquifers. Since evaporation rates in these areas are typically high, persistent substances might enrich in the groundwater recharge of closed catchments like the Jordan Valley. Against this background, unsaturated column tests were conducted to investigate the potential for evaporative accumulation of the two pharmaceuticals bezafibrate and carbamazepine under simulated arid climate conditions. Parallel tests were conducted with inhibited microbiological activity where both substances showed an increase in the effluent concentrations proportional to the evaporation loss of the inflow solution. The mean accumulation factors of the pharmaceuticals correspond to the evaporated water loss. The experiments indicate the accumulation potential for pharmaceuticals with high persistence against biodegradation. For the first time, the overall potential for evaporative enrichment could be demonstrated for pharmaceuticals. Under the given experimental conditions, the two investigated pharmaceuticals did not enrich faster than chloride, which might result in soil salting prior to reaching harmful pharmaceutical concentrations in soil water. The findings are relevant to future assessments of environmental impacts of persistent trace substances, which need to take into account that concentrations in the aquatic cycle might increase further due to evaporative enrichment.

AB Veterinary antibiotics are widely used at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to prevent disease and promote growth of livestock. However, the majority of antibiotics are excreted from animals in urine, feces, and manure. Consequently, the lagoons used to store these wastes can act as reservoirs of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There is currently no regulation or control of these systems to prevent the spread of these bacteria and their genes for antibiotic resistance into other environments. This study was conducted to determine the disinfection potential of chlorine, ultraviolet light and ozone against swine lagoon bacteria. Results indicate that a chlorine dose of 30mg/L could achieve a 2.2-3.4 log bacteria reduction in lagoon samples. However, increasing the dose of chlorine did not significantly enhance the disinfection activity due to the presence of chlorine-resistant bacteria. The chlorine resistant bacteria were identified to be closely related to Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis. A significant percentage of lagoon bacteria were not susceptible to the four selected antibiotics: chlortetracycline, lincomycin, sulfamethazine and tetracycline (TET). However, the presence of both chlorine and TET could inactivate all bacteria in one lagoon sample. The disinfection potential of UV irradiation and ozone was also examined. Ultraviolet light was an effective bacterial disinfectant, but was unlikely to be economically viable due to its high energy requirements. At an ozone dose of 100mg/L, the bacteria inactivation efficiency could reach 3.3-3.9 log. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing attention is being paid to the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. In this study, comprehensive environmental impact analyses (EIAs) were performed for the secondary treatment processes, tertiary treatment processes, and entire plants at five full-scale WWTPs in Kunming, China. The EIAs took into account greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, potential for the effluent to cause eutrophication, ecological risks posed by endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in treated effluent, and the risks posed by heavy metals in excess sludge. A comprehensive assessment toward environmental sustainability was performed using a fuzzy approach. The results indicated that the biological treatment process made the largest contribution (> 68% of the total) of the secondary treatment processes to GHG emissions and that electricity consumption made the largest contribution (> 64% of the total) of the tertiary treatment processes to GHG emissions. Large numbers of EDCs were removed during the secondary treatment processes, but the potential ecological risks posed by EDCs still require attention. High mercury concentrations were found in excess sludge. The plant that removed the largest proportion of pollutants and produced effluent posing the least ecological risks gave the best comprehensive EIA performance. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Within our therapeutic drug arsenal, antibiotics are of significant importance and are widely used in huge amounts to medicate, e.g., bacterial infections in humans and animals. Regarding the more than 10 types of antimicrobial drugs, the highly important orally taken beta-lactams typically include dry suspension formulations. In many cases for this formulation, even after usage according to specification, residues remain in the prepared dry suspension bottle, which is often cleaned at home and the contents are flushed down into domestic wastewater. This plausible practice adds to the fact that, e.g., amoxicillin can be found in river waters, and is to be monitored in the EU, as given by resolution 2008/105/EG article 8b. When imported into the environment, beta-lactam antibiotics can cause severe ecological problems, and equally importantly, therapeutic applications of these antibiotics are endangered by the forced development of pathogenic resistance. To avoid these issues, we developed and validated a fast, simple, robust, and cost-effective method using a 1 M sodium hydroxide solution to effectively hydrolyze and inactivate beta-lactam residues. In this paper, we strongly propose a procedure involving pharmacists to take back residue of beta-lactam dry suspension formulations. Subsequently, qualified pharmaceutical staff could inactivate beta-lactam residue in the laboratory by the proposed method, and then dispose of the mixture into wastewater.

AB We propose the integration of bioanodes composed of onion waste (OW)-derived biocarbon catalysts + Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) for application in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). OW is activated by pyrolysis and the resulting catalysts are functionalized with methanol by intermittent microwave heating (IMH). The functionalized-activated onion waste (FAOW) catalysts are labeled as FAOW4, FAOW6, and FAOW8 after treatment at 400, 600, and 800 degrees C, respectively. As a comparison, an N-doped graphene catalyst (FNSG) is also studied. The substrate in the anode chamber of the MFC is highly recalcitrant pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW, pH = 9.2). The XRD results show that the FAOW catalysts have an amorphous structure, contrasting with the crystalline pattern of FNSG. It is shown that microwave heating has only a slight effect on the structural order of the FAOW series while promoting disorder at FNSG. Testing in half-cells show that the current density (j) increases at anodes in the order FAOW8 > FAOW6 > FAOW4. The j values increase even more at full bioanodes after growing a biofilm of B. subtilis on the catalyst layer of FAOW8 and FAOW6. In MFC tests, the FAOW8 + B. subtilis bioanode can produce a maximum power density (P-cell) of 30.72 mW m(-2), sustaining high performance during a 14-day long-term test. Therefore, FAOW8 and B. subtilis are proposed as a highly performing catalyst-biofilm configuration to generate energy from PWW in an MFC.

AB The present study evaluated the efficiency of a semi-closed, tubular, horizontal photobioreactor (PBR) to treat a mixture of irrigation and rural drainage water, focusing in the removal of different contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), and evaluating the environmental impact of the resulting effluent. Target CECs included pharmaceuticals, personal care products and flame retardants. Of the 13 compounds evaluated, 11 were detected in the feed water entering the PBR, and diclofenac (DCF) (1107 ng L-1) and N,N-diethyl-toluamide (DEET) (699 ng L-1) were those present at the greatest concentrations. The best removal efficiencies were achieved for the pharmaceuticals diazepam (94%), lorazepam (LZP) (83%) and oxazepam (OXA) (71%), and also for ibuprofen (IBU) (70%). For the rest of the CECs evaluated, attenuation was similar to that obtained after conventional wastewater treatment, ranging from basically no elimination (carbamazepine (CBZ) and tris-(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP)) to medium efficiencies (DCF and tributyl phosphate (TBP) (50%)). Environmental risk assessment based on hazard quotients (HQs) resulted in HQ values < 0.1 (no risk associated) for most of the compounds and most of the trophic levels considered. Values between 1 and 10 (moderate risk) were obtained for tonalide (AHTN) (fish) and CBZ (invertebrates). The most sensitive trophic level was green algae, whereas fish and aquatic plants were the most resilient. Our results suggest that microalgae-based treatments could become a green, cost-effective alternative to conventional wastewater treatment regarding the efficient elimination of these contaminants.

AB Retention soil filters (RSFs) protect water bodies from pollutant loads originating from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by filtering the wastewater through a filter layer having a depth of 0.75 to 1 m. The microbiological processes in the filter material are influenced by the redox potential (Eh). This potential is a strong indicator of the prevailing environmental conditions and the possible type of microbial activity. Previous investigations of filter bodies have been confined to constructed wetlands (CWs) with regular intermittent wastewater inflow. Compared to CWs, RSFs are characterized by higher oxygen availability due to alternating operating and dry periods. This study aimed to determine the Eh in RSFs and investigate its influence on the removal efficiency for different substances. We established a conceptual model for the standard Eh curve following a loading event, and the variations to this standard in two depths and between treatments. Correlations were determined with a canonical correlation analysis between the pollutant removal of COD, ammonium, phosphorous, E. coli, somatic coliphages and diclofenac and the Eh. Although the removal efficiency is influenced by several additional operating factors such as the preceding dry period, filter age and the respective inflow concentrations, our results show that the Eh is an adequate approach to assess the removal efficiency of RSFs for these substances.

AB Highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater remains a great challenge due to low quantum efficiency and poor solar energy utilization of the currently employed photocatalysts. Herein, a novel BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst is designed and prepared by a simple one-pot solvothermal method, and characterized by various techniques. By using this photocatalyst, degradation efficiency of four kinds of emerging refractory organic pollutants (sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol A, 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen) in water is investigated under simulated solar irradiation. Then, total organic carbon is measured to determine the mineralization degree, and degradation intermediates of the pollutants are identified to propose their degradation pathway. It is found that under the given conditions, complete degradation of the pollutants is observed within the irradiation of 5-24 h, and 81-96% mineralization degree is achieved in 24 h. Furthermore, it is shown that the degradation kinetics can be described by pseudo-first order model. Based on the detected intermediates during the degradation process of 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen, the degradation pathways of these two pollutants are suggested to involve cleavage of side chain, heterocyclic ring opening and hydroxylation of aromatic ring. In addition, the application of the BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst in the purification of the spiked real wastewater is also investigated. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been widely documented that municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents are a major source of artificial sweeteners to surface waters. However, in rural areas, the extent to which septic systems contribute these same compounds to groundwater aquifers is largely unknown. We examined the occurrence of four commonly used artificial sweeteners in an unconfined sand aquifer that serves as a water supply for rural residents, as a receptor of domestic wastewater from septic systems, and as a source of baseflow to the Nottawasaga River, ON, Canada. Groundwater from the Lake Algonquin Sand Aquifer in the southern Nottawasaga River Watershed was collected from private domestic wells and as groundwater seeps discharging along the banks of the Nottawasaga River. Approximately 30% of samples had detectable levels of one or more artificial sweeteners, indicating the presence of water derived from septic system effluent. Using acesulfame concentrations to estimate the fraction of septic effluent in groundwater samples, similar to 3.4 to 13.6% of the domestic wells had 1% or more of their well water being derived from septic system effluent. Similarly, 2.0 to 4.7% of the groundwater seeps had a septic effluent contribution of 1% or more. No relationship was found between the concentration of acesulfame and the concentration of nitrate, ammonium, or soluble reactive phosphorus in the groundwater, indicating that septic effluent is not the dominant source of nutrients in the aquifer. It is expected that the occurrence of artificial sweeteners in shallow groundwater is widespread throughout rural areas in Canada.

AB Three multifunctional adsorbents of carbon-based metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives have been successfully prepared by varying zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF8) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) ratio. Thus-synthesized nanocomposites are adopted to simultaneously remove conventional phosphate and emerging organic contaminants (EOC). Among the three hybrids, ZIF8/CNT40 possessing Zn: -OH (CNT) similar to 1:2 harvests the largest contaminant removal efficiency. For the single system of phosphate, the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of ZIF8/CNT40 reaches 188.5 mg g(-1), and maintaining removal percentage of 100% and >92% in wastewater containing phosphate of 0.98 mg L-1 and 5.93 mg L-1 at neutral condition, respectively. As for phosphate-EOC binary system, the presence of phosphate has no significantly adverse impact on EOC removal. Nevertheless, the removal efficiency of phosphate is impeded by the presence of EOC, and this adverse impact of acetaminophen (AAP) and/or triclosan (TCS) is highly likely to be more serious in the binary system of phosphate and TCS. Such negative influences tend to be relived for ZIF8/CNT40 harnessing better tolerance of structure. Furthermore, these experimental results have shown a good agreement with the theoretical calculation, suggesting ZIF8/CNT hybrids hold a significant prospect for phosphate and EOC sequestration in environmental wastewater with complex components to eliminate growing eutrophication and increasing concern of EOC.

AB Activated carbon (AC) was prepared from date palm leaflets via KOH activation. AC was oxidized with HNO3 to produce oxidized activated carbon (OAC) that was surface functionalized using ethylene diamine to produce basic surface (BAC-EDA) and ethylamine to produce hydrophobic carbonaceous surface (HAC-EA). Details of preparation and characterization was published earlier. The adsorption of chlorpheniramine (CP), a basic drug, and ibuprofen (IBU), an acidic drug, on these carbons was investigated at different initial pH, contact time, drug concentration and temperature. Drug adsorption depends mainly on solution pH and the adsorbent surface nature, and initial pH 7 was found optimal for the removal of both drugs. Equilibrium adsorption was reached faster on HAC-EA, OAC and BAC-EDA than on AC with kinetic adsorption data following well pseudo second order model, and enhanced performance as temperature rises. Activation energy (E-a) was found to be in the range of 11.7-29.1 kJ/mol. Equilibrium adsorption data follow well the Langmuir model with better performance as temperature rises. CP uptake follows the order: HAC-EA > OAC > AC > BAC-EDA whereas the adsorption of IBU follows the order: OAC > AC > HAC-EA > BAC-EDA. Thermodynamic parameters showed that drug adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous. Drug adsorption from spiked hospital wastewater showed slightly less capacity than that from deionized water. Dominant adsorption forces between the drugs and the carbons varied from carbon to another depending on their surface nature and solution pH.

AB To investigate the occurrence and bioaccumulation of organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) near four major wastewater ocean outfalls in the Southern California Bight, more than 75 pharmaceutical and personal care products, current-use pesticides, and industrial/commercial chemicals were analyzed in sediment and liver tissues of hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) using gas and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. Although most CECs targeted were infrequently detected or not detectable, triclosan, 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) and bis(2-ethylhexylphthalate) were detected in all sediments at median (maximum) concentrations of 5.1 (8.6), 30 (380), and 121 (470) mu g/kg, respectively. In the liver, 4-NP and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners 47 and 99 were detected in >90% of samples at median (maximum) concentrations of 85 (290) and 210 (480) mu g/kg, respectively. The sedative diazepam was detected in all liver samples, but was infrequently detected in sediments. Sediment and liver concentrations across outfall locations ranged over several orders of magnitude and were elevated relative to a reference site. Relative to sediment, accumulation in liver of PBDEs 47 and 99 was comparable to that for legacy organochlorines, confirming their high bioaccumulation potential and suggesting their inclusion in future tissue monitoring studies. Mean tissue PBDE and diazepam concentrations were higher in livers from male versus female P. verticalis, suggesting that gender differences also be considered in designing such studies. Environ.

TI The behaviour of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals during struvite

SO WATER RESEARCH

ID SOURCE-SEPARATED URINE; WATER; NUTRIENT
AB Separating urine from wastewater at the source reduces the costs of extensive wastewater treatment. Recovering the nutrients from urine and reusing them for agricultural purposes adds resource saving to the benefits. Phosphate can be recovered in the form of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate). In this paper, the behaviour of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals during the precipitation of struvite in urine is studied.
   When precipitating struvite in urine spiked with hormones and non-ionic, acidic and basic pharmaceuticals, the hormones and pharmaceuticals remain in solution for more than 98%.
   For heavy metals, initial experiments were performed to study metal solubility in urine. Solubility is shown to be affected by the chemical conditions of stored and therefore hydrolysed urine. Thermodynamic modelling reveals low or very low equilibrium solute concentrations for cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb). Experiments confirmed Cd, Cu and Pb carbonate and hydroxide precipitation upon metal addition in stored urine with a reaction half-life of ca. 7 days.
   For all metals considered, the maximum specific metal concentrations per gram phosphate or nitrogen showed to be typically several orders of magnitudes lower in urine than in commercially available fertilizers and manure. Heavy metals in struvite precipitated from normal stored urine could not be detected.
   Phosphate recovery from urine over struvite precipitation is shown to render a product free from most organic micropollutants and containing only a fraction of the already low amounts of heavy metals in urine. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cytostatic drugs have become one of the greatest environmental threats. They occur in surface, ground and even drinking water. Their key emission sources are hospital effluents, municipal wastewater, as well as drug manufacturers and their effluents. These compounds are extremely stable in natural waters and they are not significantly removed during wastewater treatment, because they are resistant to biodegradation. The aim of this work was to establish possible negative effects of chosen cytostatics: bleomycin and vincristine on the three trophic levels of surface waters. A single agent acute toxicity test was conducted on representatives of the producer an - aquatic freshwater plant Lemna minor, the consumer - crustaceans Daphnia magna, and the decomposer - bacteria Pseudomonas putida. Binary mixture tests were performed according to the Concentration Addition, Response Additivity, and Independent Action models. Both substances had a different effect on the tested organisms; bleomycin could be classified as a very toxic, while vincristine as a toxic water pollutant. Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values designed in the presented single agent acute toxicity studies are < 10 mg/L in all the tests with bleomycin as well as vincristine conducted on L. minor. In tests with vincristine performed on D. magna and P. putida EC50 > 100 mg/L. The highest toxicity is demonstrated by bleomycin towards the aquatic freshwater plant (EC50 = 0.2 mg/L). The binary mixture of the tested chemicals showed antagonistic effects of environmental concern.

AB The laboratory scale of the two-stage membrane bioreactor (2S-MBR) was investigated to find the optimal hydraulic retention times (HRT) in treatment of selected 10 antibiotics in real hospital wastewater. It showed that elimination of the antibiotics varied, depending upon antibiotic types and HRT. High biodegradation attributed to amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Fluoroquinolones/tetracycline adsorbed highly on anoxic (ANX) sludge, but tended to be biodegraded in the aerobic tank. Sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim were mainly accumulated in the ANX/aerobic sludge. In order to increase biodegradation, 2S-MBR was upgraded to a three-stage MBR (3S-MBR) using the polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads of Pseudomonas putida (TISTR1522) in an entrapped cells reactor (ECR) as a pretreatment unit. Ciprofioxacin (CIP) in a synthetic wastewater was a refractory antibiotic for this feature investigation. It showed improvement of CIP degradation reached to 90% in 3S-MBR as compared to 58% of 2S-MBR. As a result, 24 CIP-transformed products (TPs) were detected. Additionally, 3S-MBR showed better efficacy of nitrogen removals. The SEM and FISH techniques revealed bacterial consortium in the system showing that the beads were well supported P. putida growth as well as synchronizing volume available for other bacteria. This feature makes P. putida being a potential microorganism for CIP biodegradation via bioaugmentation in 3S-MBR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zinc oxide nano-particles were synthesized, characterized and used for photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline using UV-C and visible light. Effects of several operational factors including initial pH of antibiotic solution, initial antibiotic concentration and ZnO nano-particles loading amount were investigated. Comparing photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of doxycycline under UV-C and visible light showed successful application of the method under both light sources. However, reaction rate was higher under UV-C irradiation, which degraded doxycycline almost completely in 5 hours, and 68% mineralization was achieved. Synthesized ZnO nano-particles were successfully applied for photocatalytic degradation of doxycycline in a pharmaceutical wastewater sample. The process was fitted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with rate constants in the range of 6-22 (x10(-3)) mg L-1 min(-1) with respect to initial concentration of doxycycline under UV-C irradiation. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was also employed for describing the photocatalytic reaction with surface reaction kinetic constant k(c) and equilibrium adsorption constant K-LH values calculated as 0.12 mg L-1 min(-1) and 2.2 L mg(-1), respectively. Degradation of doxycycline was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy and a validated stability indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method that was developed using stressed samples of doxycycline and could selectively determine doxycycline in the presence of its degradation products. Mass spectrometry was used for determining final degradation products.

AB This study investigate the feasibility of using solar photovoltaic cell (PV) - battery system as a renewable energy source for driven electrochemical treatment of acidic solution of food colorant Brilliant Blue FCF (E133) dye using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and carbon-felt cathode. The average solar irradiation intensity of over 20,000 kJ m(-2) day(-1) was recorded and the PV cells produced more than 10 A current intensity for 8.5-9 h a day, which was sufficient for completely charge two 12 V batteries during the day. Irrespective of slight fluctuation of solar irradiation, constant electric current values (100-500 mA) were able to selected for the electrooxidation with H2O2 (EO-H2O2) and EF treatment of E133 solution. Complete decolorization and mineralization of the E133 solutions was achieved with either process at higher current, whereas only total color removal was obtained at lower current with excellent COD removal. The initial N in the E133 molecule was recovered in the treated solutions mainly as NH4+ along with significant proportion of NO3-, whereas SO32-. in the molecule was released into the solution as SO42-. without detecting SO32-. The solar PV-battery system is a suitable green energy source for efficient electrochemical treatment of organic polluted wastewater.

AB Water and wastewater effluents contain a vast range of chemicals in mixtures that have different chemical structures and characteristics. This study presents a treatment technology for the removal of mixtures of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), oxtetracycline (OTC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP)) from contaminated water. The treatment combines pH modification of the water to an optimal value, followed by a photolytic treatment using direct polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) irradiation by medium pressure UV lamp. The pH adjustment of the treated water leads to structural modifications of the pollutant's molecule thus may enhance direct photolysis by UV light. Results showed that an increase of water pH from 5 to 7 leads to a decrease in degradation rate of SMX and an increase in degradation rate of OTC and CIP, when studied separately and not in a mixture. Thus, the optimal pH values for UV photodegradation in a mixture, involve initial photolysis at pH 5 and then gradually changing the pH from 5 to 7 during the UV exposure. For example, this resulted in 99% degradation of SMX at pH 5 and enhanced degradation of OTC and CIP from 54% and 26% to 91% and 96% respectively when pH was increased from 5 to 7. Thus the pH induced photolytic treatment has a potential in improving treatment of antibiotics in mixtures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The construction and electrochemical response characteristics of poly (vinyl chloride) matrix membrane sensors for seven phenolic compounds (phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol, alpha-naphthol and beta-naphthol) are described.
   The membranes incorporate ion association complexes of these seven phenolic anions with phenanthroline-iron(II) as electroactive materials.
   These sensors show linear response for phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol, alpha-naphthol, and beta-naphthol over wide concentration ranges, with an average anionic slope 54.3 mV per concentration decade.
   The suggested sensors exhibit fast response time (1 min), low determination limits (1 x 10(-5) M), good stability (2-3 weeks), reasonable selectivity to phenolic compounds in the presence of other water pollutants. The average percentage recovery was 99.78+/-0.088 for individual phenolates and 99.61+/-0.198 for phenolates in mixtures.
   The investigated sensors were successfully used for direct potentiometric determination of traces of these phenolic compounds in wastewater samples. Results with mean accuracy of 99.74 +/- 0.29%, 99.82+/-0.36%, 99.65+/-0.47%, 99.73+/-0.37%, 99.77+/-0.30%, 99.86+/-0.31% and 99.91+/-0.22% was obtained for the seven sensors, respectively.
   These results were compared with data obtained using the British pharamacopial method (The British Pharmacopoeia, Her Majesty's Stationary Office, London, 1993) and others (Clarke's Isolation and Identification of Drugs in Pharmaceuticals Body Fluids and Post-mortem Materials, 2nd Edition, The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1998).

AB This paper describes the degradation of the X-ray contrast agent iopromide (IOP) and the antibiotic ofloxacin (OFLOX) by the white-rot-fungus Trametes versicolor. Batch studies in synthetic medium revealed that between 60 and 80% of IOP and OFLOX were removed when spiked at approximately 12 mg L-1 and 10 mg L-1, respectively. A significant number of transformation products (TPs) were identified for both pharmaceuticals, confirming their degradation. IOP TPs were attributed to two principal reactions: (i) sequential deiodination of the aromatic ring and (ii) N-dealkylation of the amide at the hydroxylated side chain of the molecule. On the other hand, OFLOX transformation products were attributed mainly to the oxidation, hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring.
   Experiments in 10 L-bioreactor with fungal biomass fluidized by air pulses operated in batch achieved high percentage of degradation of IOP and OFLOX when load with sterile (87% IOP, 98.5% OFLOX) and unsterile (65.4% IOP, 99% OFLOX) hospital wastewater (HWW) at their real concentration (mu g L-1 level). Some of the most relevant IOP and OFLOX TPs identified in synthetic medium were also detected in bioreactor samples. Acute toxicity tests indicated a reduction of the toxicity in the final culture broth from both experiments in synthetic medium and in batch bioreactor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A combined strategy of a photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR) was evaluated for total C and N removal from a synthetic wastewater containing exclusively 200 mg L-1 of the antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Photo-Fenton reaction was optimized at the minimum reagent doses in order to improve the biocompatibility of effluents with the subsequent biological reactor. Consequently, the pretreatment was performed with two different initial H2O2 concentrations (300 and 400 mg L-1) and 10 mg L-1 of Fe2+. The pre-treated effluents with the antibiotic intermediates as sole carbon source were used as feed for the biological reactor. The SBBR was operated under aerobic conditions to mineralize the organic carbon, and the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) was optimized down to 8 h reaching a removal of 75.7% of the initial Total Organic Carbon (TOC). The total denitrification of the NO3- generated along the chemical-biological treatment was achieved by means of the inclusion of a 24-h anoxic stage in the SBBR strategy. In addition, the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) was successfully used to complete the N balance determining the N fate in the SBBR. The characterization and the good performance of the SBBR allow presenting the assessed combination as an efficient way for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with biorecalcitrant pharmaceuticals as the SMX (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For the first time, the operational feasibility of the solar photo-Fenton process at neutral pH in continuous flow has been tested for three consecutive days. The aim of the treatment was to remove of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from wastewater treatment plant secondary effluents. To this end, a 5 cm-deep raceway pond reactor was run in continuous flow mode and the degradation of the CECs present in real secondary effluents was monitored at their natural concentrations. To keep dissolved iron at neutral pH, ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) was used to form the complex Fe(III):EDDS as an iron source for the photo-Fenton reactions. At pilot scale the effects of the Fe(III):EDDS molar ratio (1:1 and 1:2) and hydraulic residence time (HRT) (20 and 40 min) on CEC removal were studied. The best operating condition was 20 min of HRT, giving rise to a treatment capacity of 900 L m(-2) d(-1), with CEC removal percentages of around 60%. The reactant concentrations were 0.1 mM Fe(III):EDDS at a 1:1 M ratio and 0.88 mM H2O2. Under these operating conditions, the short-term stability of the process was also demonstrated, thus pointing out the potential of this solar technology as a tertiary treatment.

AB 25 antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides) were detected in swine wastewater, river water, rivulet water and in groundwater samples from multi-level monitoring boreholes (with sampling ports, respectively, at 10, 25 and 50 m below the land surface) at Jianghan Plain, central China. Except swine wastewater, the antibiotic concentrations in groundwater, river and rivulet water were higher in spring than those in winter. Nineteen antibiotics were detected at 100% frequencies in all kinds of water samples. In groundwater, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were the predominant antibiotics and the total concentrations of 25 antibiotics commonly decreased with the aquifer depth. Most groundwater samples collected in spring had high concentrations of norfloxacin, with average values of 65.27 ng.L-1, 37.28 ng.L-1 and 46.83 ng.L-1, respectively, at 10, 25 and 50 m deep boreholes. By contrast, the concentrations of sulfamethazine and erythromycin were rather low in groundwater, but high in surface water. Groundwater samples collected from sites close to rivers or rivulets had much higher contents of antibiotics than those from other sites, indicating that the dominant source of antibiotics in groundwater should be the contaminated rivers or rivulets, rather than the scattered pig and poultry farms in the study area.

AB In this study, the flow dynamic behavior of cylindrical electrochemical reactor (CER) has been investigated for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluent. The residence time distribution is considered as a tool to investigate the flow dynamic behavior of the electrolyte within the reactor. The reactor is operated at fixed current density of 2.5 A/dm(2) with lead oxide/titanium as electrode by varying flow rates such as 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 L/h. Impacts of various flow rates on flow dynamics were examined. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the presence of a dead volume and short circuiting in the reactor were reduced for the optimum flow rate of 70 L/h in the reactor. The potential of the CER was experimentally validated by analyzing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, color, total dissolved solids, suspended solids and odor emanating from the effluent. Findings of this study reveal that maximum COD reduction of about 85.71% with minimum energy consumption of 63.82 kW h/kg COD at a flow rate of 70 L/h, which has good mixing and less backmixing condition inside the reactor. The experimental findings prove that the CER with a cylindrical mesh electrode can be used for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents and is capable of achieving the quality of pharmaceutical effluents treated wastewater to the reuse standard prescribed for pharmaceutical industries.

AB Membrane fouling remains the major obstacle for development of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This paper aimed at investigating the effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) present in a discontinuous way at high concentration (peak injection) on fouling propensity of activated sludge from a MBR that treats domestic wastewater. Batch experiments with peak injection of CBZ (100 mu g L-1 in sludge for 3 h) were performed for sludges sampled from a MBR operated under different organic loading conditions. HPLC-SEC analysis with a fluorescence detector was employed to study the effects of CBZ on protein-like compounds in supernatant. With addition of CBZ in sludge, a significant increase of sludge fouling propensity was observed when using sludge sampled from the MBR operated under low organic loading rate (0.1 kg COD/ kg EVESS/d), which could be attributed to the increase in the quantity of protein-like substances with a 100-1000 kDa molecular size in supernatant. Whereas reduced CBZ effect was found for sludge sampled from the MBR operated under higher organic loading rate (0.2 kg COD/kg MLSS/d). Whatever the sludge, the injection of CBZ induced no significant change of the floc size distribution and of the polysaccharide concentration in supernatant. Moreover, it did not affect the sludge microbial activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB An important beneficial reuse of treated wastewater (recycled water) in arid and semiarid regions is landscape irrigation. However, the environmental fate, especially groundwater contamination potential, of trace contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is a significant concern that can hinder the acceptance and adoption of such reuses. In this study, we irrigated mature turfgrass plots with nonspiked tertiary treated wastewater for over 6 mo at 100 or 130% of the reference evapotranspiration rate (ETo) and collected leachate water at the 90-cm depth on a weekly basis. In the recycled water, all 14 target PPCPs were consistently found, and the mean levels of atenolol, gemfibrozil, meprobamate, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole were above 100 ng L-1. However, only five compounds were detected in the leachate at trace levels. Trimethoprim and primidone were frequently found, whereas the detection of sulfamethoxazole, meprobamate and carbamazepine was less frequent (<50%). When detected, the overall mean concentration in the leachate was 10.2 ng L-1 for trimethoprim, 7.1 ng L-1 for primidone, and 2.9 to 12.4 ng L-1 for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and meprobamate. The majority of the target PPCPs were completely removed. Given that the irrigation rates were higher than normal, this study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of turfgrass systems in attenuating PPCPs during recycled water irrigation. However, it is also apparent that some PPCPs are more susceptible to leaching than others, and these PPCPs thus merit further research attention.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is detected worldwide in water bodies due to the incomplete removal by wastewater treatments. Contrasting results have been reported on the toxicity of IBU on aquatic biomonitor plants such as duckweed, and no data about IBU detection and metabolism in plants has been reported. In this work, the effects of 1 mg L-1 IBU on Lemna gibba L. were monitored in an 8-day laboratory test. In particular, an increase in frond number (+12%) and multiplication rate (+10%) while no variations in photosynthetic pigment content were observed. Moreover, UPLC-HRMS analysis of the presence of IBU and its metabolites in plants and in the growth medium was performed. The results showed that, besides IBU, 11 IBU metabolites were detected in plants. Among the IBU metabolites, hydroxyl- and dihydroxyl-IBU were found, whereas carboxyl-IBU was undetectable. Interestingly, some IBU metabolites were detected in the plant growth solution at the end of the IBU treatment, while no IBU products were found in the IBU solution without plants, suggesting a role for L. gibba in IBU metabolism. The findings of this work represent an important step for a better evaluation of the effects of IBU and its metabolites in duckweed, with notable implications for the eco-toxicological assessment of IBU in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Polar organic micropollutants (MPs) can have ecotmdcological effects on aquatic ecosystems and their occurrence in drinking water is a threat to public health. An extensive exposure assessment of MPs in large river and lake catchments is a necessary but challenging proposition for researchers and regulators. To get a complete picture of MP exposure in a large catchment, we employed a novel integrated strategy including MP measurement in the international catchment of Lake Constance and mass-flux modeling. A comprehensive screening of 252 MPs in the lake water by high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify the most commonly present MPs for the study site It was found that the wastewater borne MPs diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfarnethoxazole, acesulfame, sucralose, benzotriazole, and methylbenzotriazole accounted for the most frequent and prominent findings The concentration pattern of these compounds in the catchment was calculated based on regionalized inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WVVTPs) and substance specific elimination rates. In 52, 8, and 3 of the 112 investigated river locations the concentration exceeded the predicted no effect levels for diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, respectively. By coupling the catchment and lake model the effect of future trends in usage as well as possible mitigation options were evaluated for the tributaries and the lake. The upgrade of the major WWITs in the catchment with a postozonation step would lead to a load reduction between 32% and 52% for all substances except for sucralose (10%).

AB The feasibility of aerobic digestion for pharmaceutical and domestic sludges was studied in order to determine the best operational conditions for digestion and to assess the need for pH stabilisation. Sludge concentrations ranging from 1500 to 11000 m l(-1) and from 4500 to 22000 mg l(-1) were tested with representative domestic and pharmaceutical waste activated sludges, respectively. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), settled sludge volume, sludge volume index (SVI), stirred sludge volume index (SSVI), specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), sludge capillary suction time (CST), supernatant biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), supernatant chemical oxygen demand (COD), supernatant turbidity, sludge Roc morphology and biodiversity were all monitored. The reductions achieved in settled sludge volume, MLSS and MLVSS were higher for domestic than for pharmaceutical sludges. A significant improvement in domestic sludge settleability (due to a change in flee morphology) appeared between 14 and 21d of aerobic digestion, followed by an increase in supernatant turbidity and a decrease in sludge filterability Eventually, pH stabilisation at 6.5 improved sludge characteristics, leading to a clearer recycled supernatant and a better sludge filterability. No odour or foam problems were recorded. The aerobic digestion performance achieved was a reduction of 42-53% MLSS, 53-64% MLVSS. 66-93% SOUR, 53-81% settled sludge volume and full stabilisation for domestic sludges: while fur pharmaceutical sludges reductions of 4-18% MLSS, 6-25% MLVSS, and 64-79% SOUR were achieved with full stabilisation.

AB Methoxyanilines are aniline derivatives that are important chemical precursors for numerous Dye and Pharmaceuticals industries. Wastewater containing methoxyanilines have high toxicity and carcinogenic properties and if discharged without prior treatment into fresh water resources, can result in possible detrimental eff;ects to aquatic life and public health. Therefore, in this work Fenton-like oxidation was evaluated for the degradation of 2-methoxyaniline (2-MA) and 4-methoxyaniline (4-MA) separately using abundantly available Laterite soil as an alternative source of iron against commercially procured iron (CI) in Fenton-oxidation. Parameters like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), iron and initial methoxyanilines concentration were investigated for each of the methoxyanilines in separate experiments. For initial methoxyanilines concentration of 0.5 mM, the maximum methoxyanilines removal of 83.28 +/- 0.26% and 86.34 +/- 0.34% and COD removal of 71.91 +/- 0.31% and 72.64 +/- 0.29% for 2-MA and 4-MA at pH 3 and pH 2.5 was attained at laterite soil iron [LSI] of 0.05 mM respectively. From kinetic studies of 2-MA and 4-MA, reaction time was estimated to be 360 min. Degradation with LSI was found to be slower and lesser than CI, but is comparable and can be applied as a replacement of CI for treatment of wastewater containing toxic and incalcitrant chemicals.

AB For the first time the occurrence of 26 nitrogen heterocyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (N-HETs) and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) as a marker for anthropogenic influence was determined in an entire river system and its influents. Besides the investigation of diurnal and annual variations in concentrations, dilution and load calculations, the aims were to facilitate transferability to other rivers by identifying sources of the different substances. To create a sufficient database over 180 aqueous samples from the River Fuhse (Lower Saxony, Germany), its catchment area, effluents of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rainwater were analyzed. Typical substances found in background water samples and rain samples were quinoline and isoquinoline, whereas 1-/3-methylisoquinoline were traced back to an industrial WWTP. Due to similar concentration levels in the effluents of municipal WWTPs, their impact on the river correlated with their nominal loads. In municipal WWTP effluents CBZ (c(median) = 1693 ng L-1), 2-methylquinoline (c(median) = 64 ng L-1), and acridine (c(median) = 62 ng L-1) prevailed. Although the occurrence of N-HETs at contaminated sites is a widely discussed scientific topic, this study showed that the investigated site was a source with only small volumetric contribution to N-HET concentrations in the adjacent river. In total the River Fuhse discharges 20 kg a(-1) N-HETs and 21 kg a(-1) CBZ into the receiving river. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify sources of emerging organic contaminants in the Zumbro River watershed in Southeastern Minnesota. Two main principal components (PCs) were identified, which together explained more than 50% of the variance in the data. Principal Component 1 (PC1) was attributed to urban wastewater-derived sources, including municipal wastewater and residential septic tank effluents, while Principal Component 2 (PC2) was attributed to agricultural sources. The variances of the concentrations of cotinine, DEET and the prescription drugs carbamazepine, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole were best explained by PC1, while the variances of the concentrations of the agricultural pesticides atrazine, metolachlor and acetochlor were best explained by PC2. Mixed use compounds carbaryl, iprodione and daidzein did not specifically group with either PC1 or PC2. Furthermore, despite the fact that caffeine and acetaminophen have been historically associated with human use, they could not be attributed to a single dominant land use category (e.g., urban/residential or agricultural). Contributions from septic systems did not clarify the source for these two compounds, suggesting that additional sources, such as runoff from biosolid-amended soils, may exist. Based on these results, PCA may be a useful way to broadly categorize the sources of new and previously uncharacterized emerging contaminants or may help to clarify transport pathways in a given area. Acetaminophen and caffeine were not ideal markers for urban/residential contamination sources in the study area and may need to be reconsidered as such in other areas as well.

AB Wild male roach (Rutilus rutilus) living in U.K. rivers contaminated with estrogenic effluents from wastewater treatment works show feminized responses and have a reduced reproductive capability, but the chemical causation of sexual disruption in the roach has not been established. Feminized responses were induced in male roach exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the pharmaceutical estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, EE2 (up to 4 ng/L), during early life (from fertilization to 84 days post-hatch, dph), and these effects were signaled by altered patterns of expression of two cloned roach estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ER alpha and ER beta, in the brain and gonad/liver. Transactivation assays were developed for both roach ER subtypes and the estrogenic potencies of steroidal estrogens differed markedly at the different ER subtypes. EE2 was by far the most potent chemical, and estrone (E-1, the most prevalent environmental steroid in wastewater discharges) was equipotent with estradiol (E-2) in activating the ERs. Comparison of the EC50 values for the compounds tested showed that ER beta was 3-21-fold more sensitive to natural steroidal estrogens and 54-fold more sensitive to EE2 as compared to ER alpha. These findings add substantial support to the hypothesis that steroidal estrogens play a significant role in the induction of intersex in roach populations in U.K. rivers and that the molecular approach described could be usefully applied to understand interspecies sensitivity to xenoestrogens.

AB The contamination patterns and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were investigated in the Evrotas River (Southern Greece). This is a temporary river with differing levels of water stress and water quality impairment in a number of its reaches. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in order to capture different levels of water stress and water quality. Four sampling sites located on the main channel of the Evrotas River were sampled in July 2015 (moderate stream flow), and June and September 2016 (low stream flow). Discharge of urban wastewater has been determined as the main source of pollution, with PhACs, nutrients and other physicochemical parameters considerably increasing downstream the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Sparta city. Due to the pronounced hydrological variation of the Evrotas River, generally, the highest concentrations of PhACs have been detected during low flow conditions. Simultaneously, low flow resulted in an increased water travel time and consequently longer residence time that accounted for the higher attenuation of most PhACs. The average decrease in total concentration of PhACs within the studied waterbody segment (downstream of Sparta city) increased from 22% in July 2015 to 25% in June 2016 and 77% in September 2016. The PhACs with the highest average concentration decrease throughout the sampling campaigns were hydrochlorothiazide, followed by sotalol, carbamazepine, valsartan, and naproxen.

AB Natural and synthetic organic contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can cause ecosystem impacts, raising concerns about their persistence in receiving streams. In this study, Lagrangian sampling, in which the same approximate parcel of water is tracked as it moves downstream, was conducted at Boulder Creek, Colorado and Fourmile Creek, Iowa to determine in-stream transport and attenuation of organic contaminants discharged from two secondary WWTPs. Similar stream reaches were evaluated, and samples were collected at multiple sites during summer and spring hydrologic conditions. Travel times to the most downstream (7.4 km) site in Boulder Creek were 6.2 h during the summer and 9.3 h during the spring, and to the Fourmile Creek 8.4 km downstream site times were 18 and 8.8 h, respectively. Discharge was measured at each site, and integrated composite samples were collected and analyzed for >200 organic contaminants including metal complexing agents, nonionic surfactant degradates, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, steroidal hormones, and pesticides. The highest concentration (>100 mu g L-1) compounds detected in both WWTP effluents were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 4-nonylphenolethoxycarboxylate oligomers, both of which persisted for at least 7 km downstream from the WWTPs. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals were lower (<1 mu g L-1), and several compounds, including carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, were detected throughout the study reaches. After accounting for in-stream dilution, a complex mixture of contaminants showed little attenuation and was persistent in the receiving streams at concentrations with potential ecosystem implications.

AB Second-order rate reaction constants of micropollutants with chlorine are essential for evaluating their removal efficiencies from water during chlorine disinfection. In this study, the reactions of five selected emerging contaminants with unavailable kinetic data (Benzotriazole, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or DEET, Chlorophene, 3-Methylindole, and Nortriptyline HCl) with chlorine and bromine have been investigated, and their apparent second-order rate constants have been determined as a function of the pH. For the chlorination process, the intrinsic rate constants for the elementary reactions of the ionized and neutral species were also evaluated. The sequence of reaction rates was Methylindole > Chlorophene > Nortriptyline HCl > Benzotriazole > DEET. The bromination of the selected emerging contaminants in ultra-pure water provided exactly the same sequence of reaction rates as in the chlorination process, although higher values of rate constants. The efficiency of the chlorination process for the degradation of these ECs when present in several aqueous systems (surface water from a public reservoir, and two effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants) was investigated. During wastewater or drinking water treatment, chlorine is a good option for the degradation of Methylindole, and in a lower extent for Chlorophene and Nortriptyline. However, it is not a suitable oxidant for the abatement of Benzotriazole and DEET. Finally, chlorination in the presence of bromide revealed that low bromide concentrations enhanced slightly the degradation of the selected compounds during chlorine oxidation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new screening method was developed for the simultaneous determination of seven acidic and basic pharmaceuticals by the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) utilising triple quadrupole mass spectrometry as a detector. The target pharmaceutical compounds of interest in this work belong to different classes of pharmaceutical group with different physico-chemical properties. Both the positive and negative ionisation modes (dual ionisation mode) in electrospray ionisation (ESI) were used simultaneously. Unlike previous studies, the performance of the dual ionisation mode was compared with the positive and negative ionisation modes individually in terms of analysis time and sensitivity. Results indicate that the developed screening method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the acidic and basic pharmaceutical compounds. Using dual ionisation mode reduced the analyses time while still maintaining sensitivity and quality of the analytical result. The new method was implemented in detecting the targeted analyte in a real sample of wastewater. The instrument detection limit (IDL) was as low as 9.7 fg, indicating a high sensitivity as compared to the corresponding methods. The precision of the instrument was calculated as the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging from 1.4 to 11.0%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for the method was over the range 0.77-177 ng L-1 and 1.05-100 ng L-1 for the influent and effluent wastewater, respectively.

AB Powdered activated carbon/ultrafiltration (PAC/UF) hybrid process was investigated for removing from wastewater five pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs): 1-H-benzotriazole, DEET, chlorophene, 3-methylindole and nortriptyline-HCl. Adsorption, UF and PAC/UF experiments were performed, focusing on PPCP adsorption as a function of PPCP characteristics and organic matter (EfOM) competition. Two water matrices and two fine-particle PACs were studied, differing on EfOM nature and concentration and on PAC microporosity. Neutral PPCP uptake by the positively charged, meso- and microporous PACs followed PPCP hydrophobicity expressed by log K-ow. The uptake of the positively charged nortriptyline exceeded the expected from log D due to its high aromaticity and the background ions, which partially shielded PAC-nortriptyline electrostatic repulsions. Adsorption capacity depended on PPCP hydrophobicity whereas the kinetics further depended on PPCP charge. Hydrophobic EfOM was preferentially adsorbed and a stronger competitor, particularly for PPCPs with logK(ow) < 2.6. The highly microporous PAC better adsorbed these PPCPs and the hydrophobic EfOM, and it attenuated the EfOM competition. For all waters, PAC had no effect on UF-flux, and it significantly improved PPCP and EfOM removal by PAC/UF over standalone PAC and UF. For all conditions and microcontaminants, PPCP uptake exhibited a sigmoid curve with logK(ow), with a turning point at 2.2-2.6. In real applications, meso- and highly microporous PACs are recommended, and the dose should target the PPCPs with log K-ow < 2.6.

AB Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) and tyrosinases (EC 1.14.18.1) are ubiquitous enzymes present in nature as they are known to originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, etc. Both laccase and tyrosinase are copper-containing phenoloxidases requiring readily available 02 without auxiliary cofactor for their catalytic transformation of numerous phenolic substrates. In the present study, laccase and tyrosinase have been insolubilized as combined crosslinked enzyme aggregates (combi-CLEA) using chitosan, a renewable and biodegradable polymer, as crosslinker. The combi-CLEA, with specific activity of 12.3 U/g for laccase and 167.4 U/g for tyrosinase, exhibited high enzymatic activity at pH 5-8 and temperature at 5-30 degrees C, significant resistance to denaturation and no diffusional restriction to its active site based upon the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters. Subsequently, the combi-CLEA was applied to the transformation of acetaminophen as a model phenolic compound in samples of real wastewaters in order to evaluate the potential efficiency of the biocatalyst. In batch mode the combi-CLEA transformed more than 80% to nearly 100% of acetaminophen from the municipal wastewater and more than 90% from the hospital wastewater. UPLC-MS analysis of acetaminophen metabolites showed the formation of its oligomers as dimers, trimers and tetramers due to the laccase and 3-hydroxyacetaminophen due to the tyrosinase.

AB The widespread detection of antibiotics in the environment is concerning because antibiotics are designed to be effective at small doses. The objective of this work was to quantify the accumulation rates of antibiotics used by humans and animals, spanning several major antibiotic classes (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides), in Minnesota lake-sediment cores. Our goal was to determine temporal trends, the major anthropogenic source to these lacustrine systems, and the importance of natural production. A historical record of usage trends for ten human and/or animal-use antibiotics (four sulfonamides, three fluoroquinolones, one macrolide, trimethoprim, and lincomycin) was faithfully captured in the sediment cores. Nine other antibiotics were not detected. Ofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfapyridine, and sulfamethazine were detected in all of the anthropogenically-impacted studied lakes. Maximum sediment fluxes reached 20.5 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (concentration 66.1 ng/g) for ofloxacin, 1.2 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (1.2 ng/g) for trimethoprim, 3.3 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (11.3 ng/g) for sulfapyridine, and 1.0 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (1.6 ng/g) for sulfamethazine, respectively. Natural production of lincomycin may have occurred in one lake at fluxes ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 ng cm(-2) yr(-1) (0.1 to 5.8 ng/g). Wastewater effluent appears to be the primary source of antibiotics in the studied lakes, with lesser inputs from agricultural activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A synergistic UV/TiO2/Fenton (PCF) process is investigated for the degradation of ibuprofen (IBP) at circumneutral pH. The IBP decay in the PCF process is much faster than that with the conventional UV, UV/H2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton, and photocatalysis processes. The kinetics analysis showed that the IBP decay follows a two-stage pseudo-first order profile, that is, a fast IBP decay (k(1)) followed by a slow decay (k(2)). The effects of various parameters, including initial pH level, dosage of Fenton's reagent and TiO2, wavelength of UV irradiation, and initial IBP concentration, are evaluated. The optimum pH level, [Fe2+](0), [Fe2+](0)/[H2O2](0) molar ratio, and [TiO2](0) are determined to be approximately 4.22, 0.20 mmol/L, 1/40, and 1.0 g/L, respectively. The IBP decay at circumneutral pH (i.e., 6.0-8.0 for wastewater) shows the same IBP decay efficiency as that at the optimum pH of 4.22 after 30 min, which suggests that the PCF process is applicable for the treatment of wastewater in the circumneutral pH range. The lnk(1) and lnk(2) are observed to be linearly correlated to 1/pH(0), [IBP](0), [H2O2](0), [H2O2](0)/[Fe2+](0) and ln[TiO2](0). Mathematical models are therefore derived to predict the IBP decay.

AB The elimination of diphenolic acid (DPA) from contaminated water is an urgent challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate DPA degradation by gamma radiation, studying the influence of the dose rate, initial DPA concentration, solution pH, the presence of O-2, and the presence of different additives (e.g., Br-, Cl-, CO32-, NO2-, NO3-, and SON. A further objective was to study the effect of the water matrix (ultrapure water, surface water, and wastewater) and the variation in total organic carbon and toxicity as a function of absorbed dose. Results obtained showed that: gamma radiation was effective to remove DPA from aqueous solution; the dose constant was slightly dependent on the dose rate; and the solution pH had a major influence on DPA degradation, which was highest at pH 7. DPA degradation was reduced in the presence of Br-, Cl-, CO32-, NO2-, NO3-, and SO42- and was lower with higher concentrations of these species, largely due to their competition with DPA for the reactive radicals generated, especially Ha. Lower yield of DPA decomposition were obtained with wastewater and surface water than with ultrapure water due to the presence of organic matter and HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- ions, which react with the reactive radical species (HO., H-. and e(aq)(-)). The TOC and toxicity of the medium decreased during DPA degradation in all water types studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effective removal of refractory antidepressant in wastewater is challenging. In this study, a novel strategy of cysteine-assisted Fe2+/persulfate system(Fe2+/Cys/PS) was applied for the venlafaxine (Ven, as a typical antidepressant) degradation. The obtained results revealed that the Ven removal was evidently accelerated and enhanced in Fe2+/Cys/PS process, and achieved complete degradation in 5 min with optimal dosage. Further analysis indicated that the Ven degradation efficiency was associated with the chemical concentrations (i.e. Fe2+, Cys and PS) and operational conditions (i.e. pH and temperature). Moreover, the reactions were not impacted by the co-occurring organic matters (i.e. fulvic acid) and inorganic ions (i.e. Cl-) potentially existing in real wastewater matrices. Mechanistic explorations demonstrated that the presence of Cys promoted the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycle, and thus enhanced the reactive oxygen species yields (ROS). The center dot OH was considered as the primary ROS in Fe2+/Cys/PS process for Ven degradation via the radical scavenger verification. Also, the main intermediates of Ven degradation were identified, and the possible transformation pathway was proposed, in which the hydroxylation attacked by the center dot OH was the main reaction. Moreover, the active reaction sites in Ven were calculated with the density function theory (DFT), which was consistent with the observed metabolic routes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac is a worldwide consumed drug included in the watch list of substances to be monitored according to the European Union Water Framework Directive (Directive 2013/39/EU). Aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactors (AGS-SBR) are increasingly used for wastewater treatment but there is scant information on the fate and effect of micropollutants to nutrient removal processes. An AGS-SBR fed with synthetic wastewater containing diclofenac was bioaugmented with a diclofenac degrading bacterial strain and performance and microbial community dynamics was analysed. Chemical oxygen demand, phosphate and ammonia removal were not affected by the micropollutant at 0.03 mM (9.54 mg L-1). The AGS was able to retain the degrading strain, which was detected in the sludge throughout after augmentation. Nevertheless, besides some adsorption to the biomass, diclofenac was not degraded by the augmented sludge given the short operating cycles and even if batch degradation assays confirmed that the bioaugmented AGS was able to biodegrade the compound. The exposure to the pharmaceutical affected the microbial community of the sludge, separating the two first phases of reactor operation (acclimatization and granulation) from subsequent phases. The AGS was able to keep the bioaugmented strain and to maintain the main functions of nutrient removal even through the long exposure to the pharmaceutical, but combined strategies are needed to reduce the spread of micropollutants in the environment.

AB This paper presents for the first time the treatment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in a systematic study in different municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) of the Mediterranean area, more than 1000 km away. Solar photo-Fenton process at neutral pH with Fe3+-EDDS has been demonstrated to be very efficient under controlled conditions and must be validated in realistic and variable conditions such as real MWWTP effluents of different composition. To this end, CEC removal was studied in effluents from 5 treatment plants in the Mediterranean area of Spain, the inorganic and organic composition varying in the range 161-641 mg L-1 (sulfate), 133-538 mg L-1 (chloride) and 10-20 mg L-1 (dissolved organic carbon). More than 45 CECs were quantified in MWW and results showed that the effect on CEC elimination of the concentration of anions and organic matter was interfered by the nature of the organic matter. However, origin and composition of MWW was not critic for attaining > 80% degradation of CECs after 15 min of reaction. Moreover, conventional anions (sulfate, chloride) had a positive effect on CEC degradation rate. This paper demonstrates the consistency and predictability of the solar photo-Fenton process at circumneutral pH for treating CECs in simple and cheap photoreactors.

AB The feasibility of using activated carbon/chitosan-poly (vinyl alcohol) biocomposites (AC/CHT-PVA) as an adsorbent for removal of naproxen from a factory wastewater in Tuzla, Istanbul/Turkey was studied in the presented study. The biocomposites were synthesized with different AC: CHT-PVA ratios of 1.0; 2.0 and 3.0 (w/w). The adsorbent materials were characterized by FT-IR, SEM and TGA analysis. When AC was embedded into CHT-PVA matrix, the naproxen removal performance increased from 41.01% to 97.03%. The optimal pH for maximum adsorption was found as 7.0. Equilibrium isotherms for the naproxen adsorption onto AC/CHT-PVA biocomposite were measured experimentally. The Langmuir model was fitted to the equilibrium data better than The Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Raduskevich isotherm models. The mono layer adsorption capacity of AC/CHT-PVA: 3.0 for naproxen was found to be 12.24 mg/g at 298 K. According to the kinetics results, the equilibrium time of AC/CHT-PVA biocomposites was found 100 min and it was indicated that the adsorption follows the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The process was favorable and spontaneous. The thermodynamic parameters, Delta G degrees, Delta S degrees and Delta H degrees were calculated and the enthalpy of adsorption (Delta H degrees) was found positive for all biocomposites supported the endothermic nature of adsorption reactions.

AB The fate of anthropogenic trace organic contaminants in surface waters can be complex due to the occurrence of multiple parallel and consecutive transformation processes. In this study, the removal of five antiviral drugs (abacavir, acyclovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and zidovudine) via both bio- and phototransformation processes, was investigated in laboratory microcosm experiments simulating an open-water unit process wetland receiving municipal wastewater effluent. Phototransformation was the main removal mechanism for abacavir, zidovudine, and emtricitabine, with half-lives (t(1/2,photo)) in wetland water of 1.6, 7.6, and 25 h, respectively. In contrast, removal of acydovir and lamivudine was mainly attributable to slower microbial processes (t(1/2bio) = 74 and 120 h, respectively). Identification of transformation products revealed that bio- and phototransformation reactions took place at different moieties. For abacavir and zidovudine, rapid transformation was attributable to high reactivity of the cyclopropylamine and azido moieties, respectively. Despite substantial differences in kinetics of different antiviral thugs, biotransformation reactions mainly involved oxidation of hydroxyl groups to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Phototransformation rates of parent antiviral drugs and their biotransformation products were similar, indicating that prior exposure to microorganisms (e.g., in a wastewater treatment plant or a vegetated wetland) would not affect the rate of transformation of the part of the molecule susceptible to phototransformation. However, phototransformation strongly affected the rates of biotransformation of the hydroxyl groups, which in some cases resulted in greater persistence of phototransformation products.

AB The detection of drugs in drinking water sources has raised questions related to safety. In the absence of regulatory or other official guidance, water utilities are faced with a problem of which drugs should be monitored and the detection limits that should be required. The US FDA summarizes data required for drug approval and post marketing adverse reaction reporting. The use of these data as a means of arriving at concentrations in water where adverse health effects are minimal or non-existent was explored. The minimum therapeutic dose was assumed an appropriate point of departure. Appropriate uncertainty factors could be applied depending upon the qualitative and quantitative nature of the data that are available. Assumptions inherent in US FDA's approval of drugs for use in subsets of the population relative to the broader concerns that arise for exposures of the entire population had to be considered. Additional questions are; whether the drug under consideration is carcinogenic, carries pregnancy and lactation warnings, approval for limited vs. chronic use, exposures to multiple compounds that could act in additive or synergistic ways, and the seriousness of toxicities that are observed. Aside from these considerations, a combined uncertainty factor of 1000 appeared adequate. (C) 2011 WateReuse Research Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose Estrogenic compounds and antibiotic residues in environment are receiving significant attention because of their potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. The objectives of this study were to determine the occurrence and seasonal variability of eight kinds of estrogenic compounds and 14 antibiotics. The study developed an occurrence database of the estrogenic compounds and antibiotics in spatial and temporal scale in Jiulongjiang River, South China, to provide useful information for environmental management of this region.
   Methods Eight estrogenic compounds and 14 antibiotic compounds were detected in Jiulongjiang River from 19 sampling sites during high-flow and low-flow season in surface water. The samples were preconcentrated by solid-phase extraction for analysis. Eight estrogenic compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Agilent 7890A-5975C), and antibiotics were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (ABI 3200 Q TRAP).
   Results All target compounds could be detected, except 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, sulfamerazine, and ofloxacin. The median concentrations for seven estrogenic compounds ranged from 6.00 to 610.72 ng/L, with the detection frequency range of 16.00-100%. However, the detection frequencies of 13 antibiotics detected varied from 50% to 100%, with the median concentrations ranged from 0.89 to 117.97 ng/L. Seasonal variations were obvious for most estrogenic compounds in Jiulongjiang River, except for octylphenol and estriol. There were significant (P < 0.001) differences for three tetracyclines, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethoxazole between in low-flow season and in high-flow season. Besides, spatially considerable variations in the concentrations were observed for antibiotics, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and bisphenol A.
   Conclusion The Jiulongjiang River water was more seriously contaminated by diethylstilbestrol, estrone, sulfamethazine, and tetracyclines. Higher overall concentration levels of estrogenic compounds and antibiotics were detected in low-flow water than those in high-flow water. The pollution of estrogenic compounds and antibiotics in Jiulongjiang River mainly came from municipal sewage and livestock breeding activities.

AB Pesticides, personal care products, industrial chemicals often pollute surface- and groundwater sources. With trace concentrations and low molecular weights, these micropollutants (MPs) easily penetrate through treatment systems and impose a real health threat on drinking water consumers. The absence of a dedicated MP-retaining treatment technology at water treatment plants results in a constant consumption of MP-contaminated water. Advanced oxidation processes, and in particular the Fenton reaction, can successfully degrade MPs if other, larger, fractions of organics are retained. Here, we suggest a novel combined two-stage retention-degradation approach. Ceramic membranes retain large organics such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fenton processes disintegrate nonretained MPs such as methylene blue (MB) and bisphenol A (BPA) that penetrate through the membrane. The efficiency of the suggested approach is high. Single-layered ultrafiltration membrane retains more than 96% BSA and degrades 40-50% of MB and BPA. The degree of degradation depends on both the impregnated metal oxide and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Vanadium-based catalysts retain more than 90% MPs but leach into permeate. Ferric oxides were the only stable catalysts that performed better in membranes than when impregnated on alpha-Al2O3 pellets. A combined retention-degradation can be optimized to result in superior degree of retention. Catalytic ceramic membranes can retain large organic molecules and decompose MPs simultaneously. Three parameters affect the process efficiency: the dynamics of the influent fluid, the catalyst dose and the contact time.

AB In this study, copper-boron-ferrite (Cu-B-Fe) composites were prepared and immobilized on treated graphite electrodes via rice husk silica-based sol-gel approach. The effect of different bimetallic loading ratios was relatively evaluated for fast in-situ electrogeneration of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot) via a new droplet flow-assisted heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactor system. The optimum loading ratios of 20 wt% Fe3+ and 10% wt. Cu2+ greatly improved the catalytic activities towards efficient pharmaceutical beta blockers (atenolol and propranolol) degradation in hospital wastewater. By using Central Composite Design optimization, high correlation coefficients (R-2 and R-2-(adj)) between the experimental and predicted data of 96.83% and 93.43% were realized. At optimized conditions, higher degradation efficiencies of 99.9% for both propranolol and atenolol in hospital wastewater were achieved. The critical contribution of( center dot)OH radicals in the degradation process was assessed using radical scavengers. As a result, a surface mechanism at the integrated cathode electrode was proposed highlighting the contributions of iron and copper. It was confirmed that both copper and iron embedded in the porous graphite electrode surface catalyzed the efficient conversion of H(2)O(2 )to (OH)-O-center dot which in turn enhanced the degradation process. The fabricated cathode electrodes showed stable catalytic activities even after 20 experimental replicates at both neutral and acidic conditions.

AB A rapid and environmental-friendly analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of different personal care products (PCPs) namely synthetic musks (nitro-, polycyclic and macrocyclic musks) and the disinfectant triclosan (TCS) and its transformation product methyl-TCS in wastewater samples has been developed. The method combines dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with in situ aqueous derivatisation using acetic anhydride (Ac2O) prior to &#xfeff;gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Several parameters affecting both extraction and derivatisation efficiency (e.g. type and volume of extractor and dispersive solvents, volume of derivatising reagent, etc.) were optimised to achieve reliable conditions. Validation of the method for all compounds under study showed good linearity with coefficient of correlation > 0.9947. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 2 and 72 ng/L for musks and 28 and 31 ng/L for TCS and methyl-TCS, respectively. Accuracy, expressed as the average recoveries, ranged between 76% and 87%, and precision, expressed in terms of intraday repeatability (%RSD), was better than 13% for all analytes. The application of the method to the analysis of 24 wastewater samples enabled the detection of all the target PCPs at concentration levels up to 2.7 mu g/L, being galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) the more prevalent, present in 88% and 46% of the samples, respectively.

AB The mineralization of pharmaceutical wastewater containing chloride ions using a UV/H2O2/Fe(II) process was studied. The addition of Fe(II) to the UV/H2O2 system did not improve the degradation efficiency due to inhibition of the photo-Fenton reaction, at acid pH, in the presence of chloride ions in these wastewaters. The increase of pH from 2 to 7 increased the degree of mineralization under UV photolysis of H2O2 because more HO center dot radicals are available by HOCl center dot dissociation reaction. Under the selected operation conditions ([H2O2](o) = 11,500 ppm, [Fe(II)] = 0 ppm, [TOC](o) = 125 ppm and pH = 7), 100% of TOC removal was attained in 120 min. A significant synergistic effect of combining photolysis (UV/H2O2) and sonolysis was observed. Sonophotolysis (UV/H2O2/ultrasound) technique significantly increased the degree of mineralization (100% TOC removal in 90 min using 6500 ppm H2O2) when compared with each individual process. Sonochemical reaction was favored by the presence of chloride ions since the concentration of contaminants at the gas liquid interface increased. Free radicals reaction was the controlling mechanism in the UV/H2O2/ultrasound system. HO center dot radicals were the main oxidative intermediate species in the process, although hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2 center dot) also played a role. The contribution of thermal-pyrolytic reaction (in gas-phase) to sonophotolysis process was negligible. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates biofiltration for the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and for the reduction of non-specific toxicity expressed as baseline toxicity equivalent concentration (baseline-TEQ). Two filtering media, sand and granular activated carbon, were tested. The influence of pre-ozonation and empty-bed contact time (EBCT, from 30 to 120 min) was determined. The experiments were performed at a pilot-scale with real WWTP effluent. A previous study showed that biological activity had developed on the filtering media and dissolved organic removal had reached a steady state before sampling commenced. The results show that biological activated carbon (BAC) has a good potential for the removal of DOG (35-60%), PPCPs (>90%) and baseline-TEQ (28-68%) even without pre-ozonation. On the contrary, the sand shows limited improvement of effluent quality. Varying the EBCT does not influence the performance of the BAG filters; however, dissolved oxygen concentration could be a limiting factor. The performances of the BAG filters were stable for over two years suggesting that the main mechanism of organic matter and PPCPs removal is biodegradation. It is concluded that BAG filtration without pre-ozonation could be implemented as a low cost advanced treatment option to improve WWTP effluent chemical quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and potential sources of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters from a large coastal city Qingdao, North China, were investigated. Forty-five compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that 28 compounds of PPCPs were detected. The most frequently detected compounds were atrazine, clarithromycin, nonylphenol, and bisphenol A with the detection rates > 90%. Paracetamol showed the highest concentration up to 4400 ng/L (mean 152.5 ng/L), followed by ampicillin (max. 2980 ng/L) with the highest mean concentration (229.3 ng/L), iopromide (max. 1744 ng/L, mean 74.5 ng/L), atrazine (max. 1612 ng/L, mean 96.1 ng/L), and bisphenol A (max. 1384 ng/L, mean 78.3 ng/L). The contamination levels and composition profiles of PPCPs along the rivers flowing through rural and urban areas and in seawater showed large spatial variability. Typical source markers and principle component analysis were used to track and differentiate the potential PPCP sources. The emphases of the study were the influence of animal farming in rural areas on PPCP composition profiles and the ecological risk. The results indicated that PPCPs in Qingdao surface water mainly came from three potential sources, i.e., treated wastewater (effluents from WWTPs), untreated wastewater, and nonpoint sources in agricultural areas.

ID ILLICIT DRUGS; UVAPS; SUBSTANCES; SORPTION
AB Urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be an emission source of aerosol particles to the air and this process has the potential to spread emerging pollutants into the air, where the particles can be widely transported over long distances to areas where this pollution is unexpected. This study demonstrates aeration tanks in WWTPs as a potential source of ketamine, methamphetamine and other emerging contaminant emissions into the air. Ketamine and methamphetamine are frequently detected in high concentrations (maximum of 151.8-162.8 pg/m(3)) in gaseous and aerosol samples along with 24 other emerging contaminants. Through correlation analysis, the common occurrence of emerging contaminants in air is attributable to their high aqueous concentrations as well as their physicochemical properties. Two simple regression models are developed to provide a practical and convenient way to estimate the steady-state concentrations in air. The gas-phase emission model illustrates the relationship between the solubility, the pK(a) and the aqueous concentration of compounds in the aeration basin and their gaseous concentrations in air (statistical strength of 74.1%; p value < 0.05), while the partition model establishes the ratio of a compound in the gas and particulate phases in air (statistical strength of 82.6%; p value < 0.05). The results provide a basis for assessing the risk of the inhalation exposure to airborne emerging contaminants; however, in-depth research addressing the impact of aerosols containing persistent pharmaceuticals on human health is still needed.

AB In this study, two solar advanced oxidation processes, heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 and homogeneous photocatalysis by photo-Fenton, carried out at pilot-plant scale using compound parabolic collectors are proposed for the elimination of dipyrone and its metabolites in water. The two treatments are compared on the basis of their kinetics (parent compound and TOC), formation of degradation products (as determined by ionic chromatography, GC/MS and LC/TOF-MS), and toxicity (as evaluated by Vibrio fischeri bacteria). Photo-Fenton was more efficient than TiO2, but without, any relevant difference between the degradation products formed or toxicity. A degradation pathway is proposed, carboxylic acids being the main intermediates prior to mineralisation. Decrease in toxicity during treatment is also shown.

AB We have investigated if propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker present in sewage effluents, affects heart rate in rainbow trout. During a 48 In exposure to a very high concentration of propranolol (70.9 mu g/L) no effects on heart rate were found. After a subsequent intravenous injection of propranolol, heart rate remained unaffected in pre-exposed fish but was significantly lowered in naive fish. Other studies have reported effects on the reproduction of fish by propranolol dissolved in water at much lower concentrations. The present study suggests that physiological systems under homeostatic control, like heart rate, may not be particularly sensitive despite being direct targets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants with damaging effects to the environment and human health. Their presence in surface and especially groundwaters is regarded as detrimental, as they can ultimately reach drinking water. The aim of this work was to monitor pharmaceutical contamination of the Danube River and its tributaries in Serbia, and to assess the potential of their passing through all natural filtrations and reaching the groundwater. A total of 70 surface and groundwater samples was collected at 38 sampling sites at the Danube in Serbia. They were taken in five sampling campaigns performed in summer and autumn of 2009 and winter, spring and autumn of 2010. Samples were analyzed using a previously developed method which includes solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

AB A mixture of seven common pharmaceutical agents (acetaminophen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, and triclosan) was tested for its effects on the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca over three generations. The target concentration of each chemical (100 ng 1(-1)) was representative of the upper range observed for these substances in Canadian fresh waters, except in the immediate vicinity of effluent discharges. No statistically significant effects were observed on survival, mating, body size or reproduction. The sex ratio changed slightly to 17% more males. The seven pharmaceuticals tested do not appear to be substances of major concern for Hyalella in most Canadian fresh waters, but significant impacts might be observed in areas closer to effluent discharges.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) can simultaneously act as the initiator, promoter and inhibitor in water ozonation. This study presents an explicit method that can be used to determine these rate constants via the integration of the transient steady-state hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) model, the R-ct concept and the pseudo first-order ozone decomposition model. The theoretical background of this method was provided, and the method was validated with model compounds. The rate constants of three NOM isolates were determined using the developed method. With these rate constants, the influences of NOM on the degradation of ibuprofen, an center dot OH-reactive pharmaceutical compound, can be quantitatively described.

AB The degradation of three estrogens, two endocrine disruptors and ten pharmaceutical substances in a membrane separation bioreactor was experimentally examined. Higher removal of acidic pharmaceutical substances was obtained in the case of lower pH operation because of the increased tendency of adsorption to the sludge particles. The target substances attached to the sludge were not accumulated in the reactor and they were biologically degraded. The membrane used in this study was a microfiltration membrane which has much larger pores than target substances. However, the permeate concentration was lower than the water phase concentration in the reactor probably due to activated sludge deposition onto the membrane surface. The additional removal by the membrane was increased with the time elapsed, though the removal was not significantly high for the relatively hydrophilic compounds.

AB Environmental fate of 58 pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) grouped into 11 therapeutic classes in the three different waters, hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant (STP) and river water, was estimated by combination of their quantitative concentration analysis and evaluation of their extent of contribution as loading sources. At the same time, distribution of six classes of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) in the same water samples was estimated by screening of individual PhC-resistant microbes grown on each specific chromogenic medium. The results indicate that 48 PhCs were detected ranged from 1 ng/L (losartan carboxylic acid) to 228 mu g/L (acetaminophen sulfate) in hospital effluent, and contribution of the pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was estimated as 0.1% to 15%. On the other hand, contribution of STP effluent to river water was high, 32% to 60% for antibacterials, antipertensives and X-ray contrast media. In the cases for AMRB, detected numbers of colonies of AMRB in hospital effluent ranged from 29 CFU/mL to 1805 CFU/mL, and the estimated contribution of the AMRB pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was as low as 0.1% (levofloxacin and olmesartan) to 5.1% (N-clesmethyl tamoxifen). Although the contribution of STPs as loading sources of PhCs and AMRB in surface waters was large, ozonation as an advanced water treatment system effectively removed a wide range of both PhCs and AMRB in water samples. These results suggest the importance of reducing environmental pollutant loads (not only at STPs but also at medical facilities) before being discharged into the surface waters, to both conserve water and keep the water environment safe. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the distribution and contribution of AMRB from hospital effluent to the surface waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last few decades, there has been increasing concern about the risks posed by pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water resources. Despite the awareness of the widespread presence of PPCPs in many aquatic systems, very few studies have investigated the potential risk of these chemicals to wildlife communities of high-altitude freshwaters such as in the Italian Alps. In this context, the two-fold aim of this study was to increase the knowledge about the potential risks of PPCPs to alpine streams subjected to tourism pressure and to investigate the capability of a predictive approach as a useful tool for risk management. The Vermigliana stream (Tonale Pass, Trento Province, Italy) was selected as a case study. Although regional in nature, the selected site is representative of Italian alpine tourism areas. Risk analysis was performed on 54 PPCPs potentially released by the local sewage treatment plant during tourism periods in winter and summer.
   PPCPs were ranked by risk based on either measured environmental concentrations (MECs) or predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). The results highlighted the potential risks to aquatic organisms, particularly in winter. For instance, the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibrupofen and diclofenac were above the risk threshold showing MECs or PECs higher than their relative predicted no-effect concentrations.
   Finally, the risk classifications of PPCPs obtained using PECs and MECs were generally comparable, thereby indicating the potential usefulness of the predictive approach to plan adequate risk management actions. However, over the counter drugs were the only exceptions. The predictive approach misclassified these substances and indicated a lower risk. This highlights the difficulties in identifying the concern posed by these substances in alpine areas characterised by fluctuating population owing to seasonal tourism. Overall, these findings indicate that the proposed risk classification scheme may well be appropriate for prioritization of PPCPs in the alpine environments characterized by high tourism pressure, when robust and local data are available and reflective of most source inputs.

AB Sulfamethoxazole, a common antibiotic, was found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions. The fate of sulfamethoxazole in the activated sludge process was studied using a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). Aerobic biomass was acclimated to sulfamethoxazole and a series of kinetic experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of other carbon and nitrogen sources on the degradation of the antibiotic. It was found that sulfamethoxazole serves both as carbon and nitrogen source for the enriched consortium. It was degraded whenever there was a depletion of carbon or nitrogen or both in the feeding medium, while in the presence of acetate and ammonium nitrogen (alternative carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively), sulfamethoxazole remained intact.

AB The relation between pharmaceutical residues along the river Rhine and the demographic characteristics of the upstream population was studied. A sampling campaign was performed in which water samples from the Rhine were taken at 42 locations. Measurements were compared to a two parameter model with regional demographic data as main input. For 12 out of the 21 studied pharmaceuticals, a significant dominant demographic group could be identified. For 3 out of these 12 pharmaceuticals the male elderly were the most contributing demographic group. A Monte Carlo analysis showed a high level of significance for the results of this study (p < 0 : 01). By combining environmental water quality data and demographic data, better insight was gained in the interplay between humans and their environment, showing the medicinal footprint of the population of the Rhine basin.

AB Recycling organic waste products in agriculture is a potential route for the dispersion of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. In this study, the concentrations of thirteen pharmaceuticals and the personal care product triclosan (PPCPs) were determined in different environmental matrices from long-term experimental fields amended with different organic waste products (OWPs), including sludge, composted sludge with green wastes, livestock effluents and composted urban wastes applied at usual agricultural rates.
   PPCP concentrations were different in OWPs, varying from a few micrograms to milligrams per kilogram drymatter or per litre for slurry. OWPs from sludge or livestock effluents primarily contained antibiotics, whereas composted urban wastes primarily contained anti-inflammatory compounds.
   PPCP contents in soils amended for several years were less than a few micrograms per kilogram. The most persistent compounds (fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine) were quantified or detected in soils amended with sludge or composted sludge. In soils amended with composted municipal solid waste, carbamazepine was quantified, and fluoroquinolones, ibuprofen and diclofenac were sometimes detected. The small increases in fluoroquinolones and carbamazepine in soils after individual OWP applications were consistent with the fluxes from the applied OWP. The measured concentrations of pharmaceuticals in soil after several successive OWP applications were lower than the predicted concentrations because of degradation, strong sorption to soil constituents and/or leaching. Dissipation half-lives (DT50) were approximately 750-2500, 900 and <300 days for fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine and ibuprofen, respectively, in temperate soils and <350 and <80 days for fluoroquinolones and doxycycline, respectively, in tropical soils.
   Detection frequencies in soil leachates were very low (below 7%), and concentrations ranged from the limits of detection (0.002-0.03 mu g/L) and exceptionally to 0.27 mu g/L. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were carbamazepine and ibuprofen.
   Based on the risk quotient, the estimated ecotoxicological risks for different soil organisms were low. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Initiatives related to reverse logistics are increasingly common in companies that produce tires, lubricating oils, batteries, and electronic equipment, among others. In the pharmaceutical sector, reverse logistics is also relevant, contributing to reduce medication exposure to other people and the environment. Thus, this research seeks to find out which practices related to reverse logistics are used in 13 hospitals in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Regarding the methodological procedures, this research is supported by interviews with those responsible for disposing of medicines from hospitals, and the best practices were ranked using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Among the main difficulties for performing Medicine Reverse Logistics practices in hospitals, the absence of a standard process for medicine disposal and medications held by nurses or satellite pharmacies-for being out of control-stand out.

AB Environment pollution is causing serious human health issues and forest deterioration. Methyl mercaptan is a malodorous gaseous pollutant, which is a by product of sewage treatment plants, pulp plants, petrochemical plants, agrochemicals, and some pharmaceutical products. A long term exposure to methyl mercaptan may lead to adverse effects on central nervous system and cardiovascular system. The pharmaceutical industries are devoting significant efforts to develop process by using green solvents like water, and develop solvent-free reactions. This will help to develop green, sustainable methods for the synthesis of API and reduce the manufacturing cost. A ZnCl2 catalyzed solvent-free, one-pot process for the synthesis of ranitidine and quenching of hazardous waste methyl mercaptan gas to a useful product have been developed.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) has been used as an antimicrobial compound for many decades due to its sanitising properties. Recent studies showed that TCC is toxic and causes disruption to the endocrine system. In this work, ozone oxidation of TCC was studied in 70% acetonitrile:30% water solutions. Ozone degraded TCC effectively and the reaction rates increased substantially with ozone gas concentration, pH and temperature. Second-order-reaction kinetics was suitable to describe the chemical reaction. The effect of temperature was described by the Arrhenius equation and the activation energy was found equal to 31.0 kJ/mol. The stoichiometry of the reaction was one and the value of the rate constant at pH 7 was 5 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Residues of malachite green (MG), a veterinary drug illegally used for the treatment of aquacultured fish, have been found in wild eels caught from surface waters downstream from the sewers of different municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). MG and its metabolite leucomalachite green (LMG) were detected with total concentrations up to 0.765 mu g kg(-1) fresh weight in the tissues of 25 out of 45 eels caught from different lakes, a river and a canal in Berlin, Germany. In all cases, the occurrence of the residues could directly be linked to the presence of discharges by municipal STPs into the receiving surface waters. MG is a multiple-use compound that is also used to color materials. Thus, it appears to be reasonable that the residues of MG found in the eel samples originate from such uses, e.g. by wash off from clothes or paper towels colored with MG. Additional loads from legal uses of MG as veterinary drug for the treatment of ornamental fish (private aquaria) are possible. The results obtained from this study are the first proof of background contaminations of a veterinary drug found in samples of fish not intentionally treated with such agents.
   MG and LMG are regarded as potential genotoxic carcinogens making it impossible to establish a tolerable daily intake. A margin of exposure (MOE) approach was applied to evaluate the human health risk associated with the consumption of the eels investigated in this study. With a MOE of 3.4 million the chronic risk was classified as being very low. Nevertheless, due to their potential to act as genotoxic carcinogens, any oral exposure to residues of MG and LMG should be avoided. According to European Union law, zero tolerance applies to all residues of MG and LMG found in food for human consumption as MG is not registered for use as veterinary drug. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work investigated the individual and combined effects of zinc oxide, norfloxacin, and sulfamethazine on sludge anaerobic digestion-associated methane production, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and microbial diversity. Norfloxacin and sulfamethazine (500 mg/kg) did not inhibit methane production, but inhibited its production rate. Zinc oxide nanoparticles with antibiotics inhibited hydrolysis, fermentation, and methanogenesis over varying digestion periods. Complex pollution had a greater impact on methane production than zinc oxide alone, with acute, synergistic toxicity to methanogenesis over short periods. Complex pollution also had varying effects on bacterial and archaeal communities during digestion. These results aid understanding of the toxicity of emerging contaminants in sludge digestion, with the potential to improve pollution removal and reduce associated risks.

The developed carbon-tubules were applied for the aqueous phase decontamination of three pharmaceutical drugs. Ibuprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were selected for the study. Batch and fixed-bed studies were performed to investigate the adsorption of selected pharmaceutical drugs. Mathematical modelings were applied to the experimental data in order to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity and evaluate the characteristics of the fixed-bed. Based on finding, the adsorption mechanism was investigated by adsorbate and adsorbent physicochemical characteristics. (C) 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB The antipsychotic drug quetiapine (QUT) has been frequently detected in sewage treatment plants. However, information on the fate of QUT in aquatic environments and its behavior during UV treatment is limited. In this study, QUT is shown not to be readily biodegradable in the Closed Bottle Test and the Manometric Respirometry Test according to OECD guidelines. The main biotransformation product (BTP) formed in the tests, a carboxylic acid derivative, was identified by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry. This BTP is presumably a human metabolite and showed higher detection rates than QUT in a river sampling campaign conducted in northern Germany. UV elimination kinetics of QUT at different initial concentrations (226.5, 45.3,11.3, and 2.3 mu mol L-1) were faster at lower initial concentrations. All seven phototransformation products (PTPs) could be still identified at initial concentration of 11.3 mu mol L-1. The photolytic mixture generated after 128 min of photolysis of QUT was not better biodegradable than QUT. Initial UV treatment of QUT led to the formation of several additional BTPs. Four of them were identified. The bacterial cytotoxicity and genotoxicity before and after phototransformation of QUT in a modified luminescent bacteria test (LBT) and the umu-test (ISO/FDIS 13829) showed cytotoxic effects in the LBT for QUT. Furthermore, PTPs had similar cytotoxic effects on luminescent bacteria. The umu-test did not reveal any genotoxic activity for QUT or PTPs. In conclusion, the release of QUT into sewage treatment plants and aquatic environments could result in the formation of a main BTP. Additional UV treatment of QUT would lead to the formation of additional BTPs. Moreover, treatment did not result in lower toxicity to tested organisms. In conclusion, UV treatment of QUT should be considered critically as a potential treatment for QUT in aquatic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the transcriptional levels of selected genes in liver and head kidney of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua sampled in Store Lungegrdsvann, a seawater recipient situated in the middle of the city of Bergen, Norway, for effects of contaminants released from municipal sewage effluents and former dump sites. Five males and six females were caught with fish traps in Store Lungegrdsvann in 2006. Cod from a location near Jondal in the Hardanger Fjord were used as controls (five males and four females). The following 12 genes were picked as potential markers of contaminant exposure: cytochrome P-450 1A (CYP1A), cytochrome P-450 2C33-like (CYP2C33-like), cytochrome P-450 3C (CYP3C), glutathione S-transcriptase (GST) (detoxification and biotransformation), Mn superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) (oxidative stress), vitellogenin A (VtgA), vitellogenin B (VtgB), zona pellucida 2 (ZP2) (effects of estrogen disruptors), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) (radiation). The results showed that two males caught in Store Lungegrdsvann possessed high transcriptional levels of VtgA, VtgB, and ZP2 mRNA in the liver. In addition, CYP1A was 4.9-fold higher expressed in males from Store Lungegrdsvann compared to males from the reference population. CYP2C33-like mRNA expression was significantly higher (1.8-fold) in females from Store Lungegrdsvann than in females from the reference population. CYP1A was significantly lower (4.7-fold) expressed in head kidney of females from Store Lungegrdsvann than in females from Hardanger Fjord. In a follow-up examination with sexually mature cod sampled in Store Lungegrdsvann in 2007, the livers were shown to contain high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxin-like PCB. In conclusion, fish inhabiting Store Lungegrdsvann are exposed not only to endocrine disruptors but also to other contaminants that affect the transcription of phase I biotransformation genes.

AB Pharmaceuticals are "emerging contaminants" in the environment, which have received increasing attention in recent years, in part, because these compounds are constantly being emitted into the environment in quantities similar to other organic contaminants, and thus may be candidates for future regulation. This paper reviews recently published data with respect to sample-preparation techniques for determining pharmaceutical traces in various different environmental matrices using liquid chromatography. An overview of multi-residue analytical methods, covering sample extraction and purification as well as chromatographic separation and various different detection methods is provided to illustrate common trends and method variability. Additionally, recent developments and advances in this field are presented.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in landfills has been largely neglected. Once discarded in municipal solid waste (MSW), pharmaceuticals within a landfill may undergo degradation, adsorption, or enter the leachate and eventually exit the landfill. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration of MSW was predicted using available statistics on medication usage and directly measured by a MSW composition study. Estimation calculations resulted in a potential concentration of APIs from 7.4 to 45 mg/kg of MSW, varying with the percentage of dispensed medications assumed to become unused. Direct measurement resulted in the collection of 22 APIs comprising a total of 22,910 mg. This resulted in a final concentration of 8.1 mg/kg within MSW. Additionally, 45 empty medication containers were collected which potentially contained 33 differing APIs upon disposal. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment is receiving great attention since significant levels of contamination have been found, not only in sewage treatment plant effluents, but also in open waters. In our study, the toxicity of three anticonvulsant drugs commonly found in the environment (diazepam, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) was evaluated in Lepomis gibbosus (pumpkinseed sunfish). This study focused on oxidative stress parameters, namely: glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), catalase (CAT), and lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) in the hepatic, digestive, and gill tissues of exposed animals. Simultaneously, we assessed the effects of these drugs in terms of behavioural parameters, such as scototaxis and activity. Exposure to diazepam caused an increase in GST activities in the gills and an inhibition of GRed in the digestive tract, relative to control, suggesting an antioxidant response. It also caused fish to spend more time swimming and less time in a refuge area (black compartment of an aquarium). Exposure to carbamazepine caused an increase in GSTs and GRed activity in the digestive tract, which is not always consistent with the literature. A significant positive correlation was found between carbamazepine concentration and time spent in motion and a negative correlation with time spent in black compartment. Exposure to phenytoin was responsible for adaptive responses in the activities of CAT and GSTs (in the liver), but it did not elicit any behavioural alterations. Although all three drugs seemed to induce oxidative stress in some organs, peroxidative damage (measured as TBARS concentrations) was not found at the selected range of concentrations. Our results enlighten the need for more research on the ecological consequences of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, especially drugs that interfere with the CNS and behaviour, because the net outcome of these effects may be difficult to predict.

Raw Lake Huron water spiked with nine target compounds was treated in a dual train pilot scale treatment plant. None of the target chemicals showed any significant removals following conventional treatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration). Five of the nine target pollutants plummeted to concentrations below the method detection limits following AOP. For all the target compounds AOP treatment provided higher removal compared to conventional treatment.

AB In this study, experiments were performed to assess the significance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the leachability of four common EDCs, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), progesterone (PGT) and testosterone (TST), in municipal sewage sludge (MSS) under landfill conditions. The DOM was derived from two sources: MSS (MDOM), and natural soil represented by organic matter obtained from the Suwannee River (NDOM). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix quenching combined with parallel factor analysis was adopted to characterize the interaction properties between the EDCs and DOM. The accumulative leachability of the target EDCs ranged from 0.09% (PGT) to 3.8% (TST). In particular, the leaching of BPA, EE2 and TST followed S-shaped curves, while PGT exhibited continuous leaching potential in untreated MSS. With the introduction of DOM, (i) the leachability of BPA and EE2 increased to 13A% and 61.6%, respectively, whereas those of PGT and 1ST declined by 61.3% and 45.8%, respectively, and (ii) BPA, EE2 and PGT no longer reached leaching equilibrium but the S-shaped leaching property of TST persisted. The differential effects of MDOM and NDOM at identical concentrations on the EDCs leachability increased with curing time. BPA, EE2 and PGT quenched the MDOM fluorophores attributed to aromatic protein-like components. The fluorescence quenching of NDOM by BPA. EE2 and PGT was centered on soluble microbial by-product-like and humic-like substances. Compared with PGT, EE2 and BPA had greater capability for binding with DOM components largely via hydrophobic interactions, whereas PGT preferentially interacted with the DOM hydrophilic functionalities through specific interactions. TST had no binding capability but displayed potentials competing for sorption sites with DOM moieties. Our findings suggested that the management of MSS increased the risk of environmental contamination by EDCs for a long duration and that DOM was a useful indicator to predict the migration and transport properties of EDCs.

AB The occurrence of 73 representative pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) was assessed in a sewage-impacted section of the Llobregat River (NE Catalonia, Spain). This Mediterranean river is characterized by flow rate fluctuations strongly influenced by seasonal rainfall. River flow variations increase the potential environmental risk posed by organic micro-pollutants as their concentrations may increase substantially under low flow conditions. Little is known about the transport behavior of emerging contaminants in surface waters once they are discharged from waste water treatment plants (WWTP) into rivers. This research aimed to study the presence and fate of emerging contaminants under different hydrological conditions by sampling two different sites along the river in different seasons. The highest levels of pharmaceuticals were determined during cold and dry periods. The impact of the flow changes on the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the river was assessed with the relative sensitive coefficients. Due to expected dilution effects, the response of pharmaceuticals to river flow was negative. Only in a few cases, positive relationships between drug concentrations and flow were detected, suggesting an important role of other hydrological phenomena like sediment re-suspension as well as the source of pollutants. To evaluate the role of other factors influencing PhAC concentrations, a plug-flow model was applied to obtain disappearance constants "k" for a set of selected compounds. Erythromycin presented k values of -0.15 h(-1) in both sites being the compound more efficiently removed from the water column. The k values for ibuprofen, furosemide, enrofloxacin, enalapril, acetaminophen, diclofenac and Ketoprofen were between -0.04 and -0.10 h(-1) showing less disappearance than erythromycin in the water column. However, other compounds presented k values <0.06, which suggested conservative behavior of these compounds in the water column. This study supports the reliability of the calculated k values for the disappearance of compounds in river waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns about the effect of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent on he health of freshwater ecosystems have increased. In this sludy, a unique approach was designed to show the effect of an STP effluent-dominaled stream on naive wild brown Luna (Sohn trultu L.) exposed under fully natural conditions. Zivny stream is located in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The downstream site of Zivny stream is an STP-affecled sire, which receives 25% of is wafer from Prachalice STP effluent.. Upsffeam, however, is a minimally polluted water site and i is considered Lo be the control sire. Native fish were collected from the upstream site, Lagged, and distributed W both upstream and downstream sites. After 30, 90, and 180 days, fish were recaptured from both sites to determine whether the downstream site of the Zivny stream is associated with the effects of environmental pollution. Several biomarkers indicating the oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities, cytochrome P450 activity, xenoestrogenic effects, bacterial composition, and lipid composition were investigated. Additionally, polar chemical contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)) were quantified using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Fifty-three PPCPs were detected in the downstream site; 36 of those were constantly present during the 180-day investigation period. Elevated hepatic 7-benzyloxy-4trifluoromethylcoumarin-0-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) (alter 90 days) and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations in males were detected in fish downstream of the SIP effluent during all sampling events. An increase in the fishes' total fat content was also observed, but with low levels of omega-3 fatty acid in muscle tissue. Two bacterial taxa related to activated sludge were found in the intestines of fish from downstream. Our results show that Prachatice STP is a major source of PPCPs in the Zivny stream, which has biological consequences on fish physiology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A screening of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and additives in personal care products (PPCPs) in sub-arctic locations of the Faroe Islands (FO), Iceland (IS) and Greenland (GL) was conducted. In total 36 pharmaceuticals including some metabolites, and seven additives in personal care products were investigated in influent and effluent waters as well as sludge of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and in water and sediment of recipients. Concentrations and distribution patterns for PPCPs discharged via sewage lines (SLs) to the marine environment were assessed. Of the 36 pharmaceuticals or metabolites analysed 33 were found close to or above the limit of detection (LOD) in all or a part of the samples. All of the seven investigated additives in personal care products were detected above the LOD. Some of the analysed PPCPs occurred in every or almost every sample. Among these were diclofenac, ibuprofen, lidocaine, naproxen, metformin, citalopram, venlafaxine, amiloride, furosemide, metoprolol, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and cetrimonium salt (ATAC-C16). Additionally, the study encompasses ecotoxicological risk assessment of 2/3 of the analysed PPCPs in recipient and diluted effluent waters. For candesartan only a small margin to levels with inacceptable risks was observed in diluted effluent waters at two locations (FO). Chronical risks for aquatic organisms staying and/or living around WWTP effluent pipe-outlets were indicated for 17 beta-estradiol and estriol in the three countries. Additives in PCPs were found to pose the largest risk to the aquatic environment. The surfactants CAPB and ATAC-C16 were found in concentrations resulting in risk factors up to 375 for CAPB and 165 for ATAC-C16 in recipients for diluted effluents from Iggia, Nuuk (GL) and Torshavn (FO) respectively. These results demonstrates a potentially high ecological risk stemming from discharge of surfactants as used in household and industrial detergents as well as additives in personal care products.

AB Ny-Alesund, one of four permanent settlements on Spitsbergen in Svalbard, is a research town that includes scientific institutes from many countries. Because of daily-used chemicals (e.g., pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)) used by residents in the area, generated sewage is considered as a point source in the Kongsfjorden. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify organic pollutants in the effluent and along the shoreline and offshore via target, suspect, and non-target screening using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. We tentatively identified 30 compounds using the suspect and non-target screening methods in effluent samples from our first visit to the settlement in 2016. Among these, 3 were false positive, 24 were confirmed, and the 3 remaining compounds were not confirmed because of a lack of reference standards. Of the confirmed, 21 were quantifiable and considered target compounds for the 2nd year study. The quantified compounds in the effluent samples in 2017 totaled 17, including PPCP5, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and their metabolites. Some of the compounds, such as caffeine, paraxanthine/theophylline, acetaminophen, cetirizine, diethyl toluamide (DEET), and icaridin, were also detected in the receiving seawater. The concentration range was from 4 to 280,000 ng/L in the effluent and 2-98 ng/L in the seawater. Other 24 compounds were tentatively identified in the second-year effluent samples. Five were further confirmed using reference standards. Prioritization was performed on the 47 substances screened in Ny-Alesund using the exposure and toxicity index. As the result, the top seven substances of concern present were perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), irbesartan, DEET, acetaminophen, caffeine, and paraxanthine/theophylline. As the effluent was identified as a source of the concerned organic pollutants, an emission reduction strategy should take place for protection of Arctic Fjorden environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fifty-five pharmaceuticals were monitored at four rivers and inlets and/or outlets of three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Yodo River watershed, Japan over 17 sampling events. Twenty-six quantified pharmaceuticals were classified by source and fate. The load per person (LPP) of nine pharmaceuticals, including six with observed mass balance in studied river stretch of <80%, was appreciably lower in river water (RW) than in the effluent (EF) of STPs (RW/EF <0.5), indicating that they were susceptible to in-stream attenuation in the study area, while the others were relatively conservative. The LPP of 12 pharmaceuticals in RW were within +/- 50% of that in EF. Because their mass loadings in rivers were correlated with human population in the catchment and most people use the sewer system, the major source of the 12 pharmaceuticals was considered to be STPs. The LPP of the three most labile pharmaceuticals in STPs (caffeine, theophylline, and acetaminophen) was >1.5 in RW/EF and <1.0 in RW/influent (IF) of STPs. Poorly treated sewage discharged from households without using the sewer system was considered to be influential source of the three pharmaceuticals. The LPP (RW/EF) of caffeine, a pharmaceutical contained in food and beverage, was considerably higher than that of the other two, and this is attributable to untreated gray water discharged at households using the night-soil treatment system. The LPP of two veterinary drugs (sulfamonomethoxine and lincomycin) were >1.5 (RW/EF) and >1.0 (RW/IF). Their mass loadings in rivers showed a positive correlation with swine population in the catchment, although sulfamonomethoxine is equally used in both cattle and swine farming. This was attributable to application of cattle excrement as manure, and lability of sulfamonomethoxine during composting processes. The major source of the two veterinary drugs was considered to be on-site treatment facilities of swine urine. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment has become a subject of growing concern. The extensive use of vancomycin and other pharmaceuticals may alter the biodiversity of soil microbial communities and select antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of vancomycin and/or vancomycin-resistant Citrobacter freundii on soil microbial communities using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) approaches. The experiment had a completely randomized block design with the following treatments: control soil (C), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil-VA1), soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil VA10), soil with C. freundii (Cit), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA1+Cit), and soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA10 Cit). A bacterial strain resistant to vancomycin was isolated from raw sewage collected from the municipal sewage treatment plant. The obtained results indicated that the antibiotic and/or the bacterial strain exerted a selective pressure that resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in the population of soil microorganisms. However, a multivariate analysis showed that the genetic and structural diversity of the soil microbial community was primarily affected by the incubation time and to a lesser extent by the antibiotic and introduced bacteria. DGGE analysis clearly showed that certain species within the bacterial community were sensitive to vancomycin as was evidenced by a decrease in the values of S (richness) and H (Shannon-Wiener) indices. Moreover, a PLFA method-based analysis revealed alterations in the structure of the soil microbial community as indicated by changes in the biomass of the PLFA biomarkers specific for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi. The changes observed in the community of soil microorganisms may decrease the rate of microbial-mediated processes, which can lead to a disturbance in the ecological balance of the soil ecosystem.

AB A SPE-LC/MS/MS liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was validated for the isolation and quantification of six beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, nadolol and pindolol) and one metabolite (4-hidroxy propranolol) in surface water samples. Using entire procedure we obtained good recovery rates (74.8-102.5%) and low quantification limits (0.17-3.69 ng/L) for target compounds. The impact of two waste water-treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents on the Jiu and Danube rivers was evaluated by analyzing of surface water samples collected in upstream and downstream of WWTPs. It was found that Jiu river was more contaminated than Danube. For propranolol the increase concentration factors were 8.3 in Jiu river and 7.7 in Danube river.

AB A method for simultaneous analysis of bisphenol A (BPA) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in water supply was developed using solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The linearity was evaluated between 2.5 and 200 mu g L-1 (r> for the analytes. The limits of quantification were 1.5 and 2.1 ng L-1 for BPA and EE2, respectively. The extraction was made with C18 cartridges, and recoveries obtained varied between 70 and 102 % for the strengthening of 5 mu g L-1. After the validation, the method was applied in the determination of pollutants in surface water and water supply of Sao Luis, Brazil, where BPA was found in two of the eight samples analyzed, with concentrations of 1.11 and 3.61 mu g L-1.

AB The expression levels of cytochrome P450 1A, p53 and vitellogenin were investigated in three different tissues of male medaka fish after exposure to diclofenac that is one of the main concerns among pharmaceuticals frequently found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. The results showed that cytochrome P450 1A, p53 and vitellogenin were highly expressed in tissue-specific gene expression patterns after exposure to 8 mg/l and 1 mu g/l of diclofenac. These elevated expression levels of three biomarkers suggested that diclofenac has potential to cause cellular toxicity, p53-related genotoxicity and estrogenic effects. It is also noteworthy that diclofenac has the potential to cause these effects even at an environmentally relevant concentration of diclofenac, 1 mu g/l. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rivers in urban areas have been associated with water quality problems because of the practice of discharging untreated domestic and industrial waste into the water bodies. However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

AB This study aimed at assessing the influence of primary treatment (hydrolytic upflow sludge blanket (HUSB) reactor vs. conventional settling) and operational strategy (alternation of saturated/unsaturated phases vs. permanently saturated) on the removal of various emerging organic contaminants (i.e. ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen, tonalide, oxybenzone, bisphenol A) in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands. For that purpose, a continuous injection experiment was carried out in an experimental treatment plant for 26 days. The plant had 3 treatment lines: a control line (settler-wetland permanently saturated), a batch line (settler-wetland operated with saturate/unsaturated phases) and an anaerobic line (HUSB reactor-wetland permanently saturated). In each line, wetlands had a surface area of 2.95 m(2), a water depth of 25 cm and a granular medium D-60 = 7.3 mm, and were planted with common reed. During the study period the wetlands were operated at a hydraulic and organic load of 25 mm/d and about 4.7 g BOD/m(2)d, respectively. The injection experiment delivered very robust results that show how the occurrence of higher redox potentials within the wetland bed promotes the elimination of conventional quality parameters as well as emerging microcontaminants. Overall, removal efficiencies were always greater for the batch line than for the control and anaerobic lines, and to this respect statistically significantly differences were found for ibuprofen, diclofenac, oxybenzone and bisphenol A. As an example, ibuprofen, whose major removal mechanism has been reported to be biodegradation under aerobic conditions, showed a higher removal in the batch line (85%) than in the control (63%) and anaerobic (52%) lines. Bisphenol A showed also a great dependence on the redox status of the wetlands, finding an 89% removal rate for the batch line, as opposed to the control and anaerobic lines (79 and 65%, respectively). Furthermore, diclofenac showed a greater removal under a higher redox status (70, 48 and 32% in the batch, control and anaerobic lines). Average removal efficiencies of acetaminophen, oxybenzone and tonalide were almost >90% for the 3 treatment lines. The results of this study indicate that the efficiency of horizontal flow constructed wetland systems can be improved by using a batch operation strategy. Furthermore, we tentatively identified 4-hydroxy-diclofenac and carboxy-bisphenol A as intermediate degradation products. The higher abundance of the latter under the batch operation strategy reinforced biodegradation as a relevant bisphenol A removal pathway under higher redox conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Cefaclor, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is widely used as an antibiotic. Kinetic studies were conducted to evaluate the decomposition and mineralization of cefaclor using gamma radiation. Cefaclor, 30 mg/l, was completely degraded with 1000 Gy of gamma radiation. At a concentration of 30 mg/l, the removal efficiency, represented by the G-value, decreased with increasing accumulated radiation dose. Batch kinetic experiments with initial aqueous concentrations of 8.9, 13.3, 20.0 and 30.0 mg/l showed the decomposition of cefaclor using gamma radiation followed a pseudo first-order reaction, and the dose constant increased with lower initial concentrations. At a given radiation dose, the G-values increased with higher initial cefaclor concentrations. The experimental results using methanol and thiourea as radical scavengers indicated that (OH)-O-center dot radicals were more closely associated with the radiolytic decomposition of cefaclor than other radicals, such as e(aq)(-) or H-center dot. The radical scavenger effects were tested under O-2 and N2O saturations for the enhancement of the TOC percentage removal efficiencies in the radiolytic decomposition of cefaclor. Under O-2 saturation, 90% TOC removal was observed with 100 000 Gy. Oxygen is well known to play a considerable role in the degradation of organic substances with effective chain reaction pathways. According to the effective radical reactions, the enhanced TOC percentage removal efficiencies might be based on the fast conversion reactions of e(aq)(-) and H-center dot with O-2 into oxidizing radicals, such as O-2(center dot-) and HO2 center dot, respectively. 100% TOC removal was obtained with N2O gas at 20 000 Gy, as reducing radicals, such as e(aq)(-) and H-center dot, are scavenged by N2O and converted into (OH)-O-center dot radicals, which have strong oxidative properties. The results of this study showed that gamma irradiation was very effective for the removal of cefaclor in aqueous solution. The use of O-2 or N2O, with radiation, shows promise as effective radical scavengers for enhancing the TOC or COD removal efficiencies in pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics. However, the biological toxicity and interactions between various chemicals during the radiolytic treatment, as well as treatments under conditions more representative of real wastewater will require further studies.

AB This article addresses the issue of quality in reused water for potable purpose. The concerns of potential presence of pathogens and inorganic and organic constituents in the reused water and their health implications are discussed. Presently, there are no specific or international guidelines or standards for treatment or monitoring when municipal wastewater is used for potable purpose. Research to advance the safety, reliability and economic sustainability of reuse is also lacking. When assessing the risks associated with reclaimed water, the potential of production failure and reliability also needs to be addressed and mitigated.

AB This work aims to use electroanalytical techniques, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), to monitor and evaluate the behaviour of folic acid (FA) during the electrooxidation (EO). The electroanalytical method to quantify the concentration of FA has been standardised in order to establish the best conditions of pH and concentration range. The EO was performed using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and titanium, as anode and cathode, respectively. According to the data obtained, it was possible to follow the degradation of FA by using DPV technique, determining its concentration, as a function of time.

AB The prepared Fe3O4/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) is an effective method of removing some pharmaceuticals from water matrices for environmental protection. Therefore, operating parameters (catalyst dose, H2O2 dose, flow rate, pH) of CWPO with the easy-prepared Fe3O4/MWCNT composite were evaluated for the effective NAP removal in an up-flow bed reactor (UFBR). The prepared catalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile coprecipitation method. The highest removals of TOC and NAP by continuous CWPO of NAP aqueous solution (10 mg L-1) were obtained in the experiments with ratios 0.4 g of catalyst load/double H2O2 stoichiometric ratio (78.4% for TOC and 83% for NAP), and 0.2 g of catalyst load/stoichiometric dose (39.1% for TOC and 73.1% for NAP). Both operated at 10 mg L-1 of NAP, 1.7 mL min(-1), 50 degrees C and circumneutral pH. In addition, their high consumption H2O2 efficiency (> 59.6%) and a low concentration of leached iron dissolved (< 0.28 mg L-1) found at 450 min indicated the great catalyst stability. Furthermore, the application of CWPO for different aqueous matrices, the NAP removal from in a surface water sample was almost complete (90.5%) 1260 min TOS while whereas in the hospital wastewater and wastewater treatment plant effluent samples were 64.9% and 58.9%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that continuous CWPO with the easy-prepared Fe3O4/MWCNTs has the potential to be applied as an effective treatment for the rapid removal of NAP from different water matrices.

AB Pharmaceutical waste has attracted significant attention in the past two decades due to the current high consumption of pharmaceuticals together with the development of reliable detection technologies. In order to acquire better understanding on pharmaceuticals removal in biological processes, the treatment of synthetic wastewater containing diclofenac (DFN) and ibuprofen (IBU), two of the most commonly prescribed medicines worldwide, was studied using a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). An 8.5-L aerobic MBBR with Kaldnes packing filling ratio of 40% was designed. The controlled parameters were pH within neutral range, temperature of 37 degrees C, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of 2100 mg/L, and attached growth equal to 1300 mg/L. Tests were conducted for four different initial pharmaceuticals concentrations: 2, 4, 7 and 10 mg/L, two hydraulic retention times (HRT): 5 and 10 h and two chemical oxygen demands (COD): 500 and 1000 mg/L. Results demonstrated that generally, DFN had higher removal percentage than IBU in the MBBR. At HRT = 10 h, DFN removal was between 30.83 and 66.01%, while it was 11.33 and 37.33% for IBU. At HRT = 5 h, DFN and IBU removal were respectively between 31.10-65.33 and 0-35.10%. It can be concluded that HRT = 5 h is the optimal time for DFN, while 10 h HRT promises noticeably better IBU removal. Furthermore, results revealed that DFN is better removed in the lower COD, while IBU showed better removal in the higher COD. Finally, the study on their toxicity reveals that pharmaceuticals exert slightly negative effect on COD removal.

AB New, sustainable, and low-cost materials that can simultaneously remove a range of wastewater contaminants, such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical residues, are needed. In this work, modified biochars were produced by dip-coating hickory or bagasse biomass in carbon nanotube (CNT) suspensions with or without sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)-aided dispersion prior to slow pyrolysis in a N-2 environment at 600 A degrees C. The sulfapyridine (SPY) and lead (Pb) sorption ability of pristine hickory (HC) and bagasse (BC) biochars and the modified biochars with (HC-SDBS-CNT and BC-SDBS-CNT, respectively) and without (HC-CNT and BC-CNT) SDBS was assessed in laboratory aqueous batch single- and binary-solute system. The greatest removal of SPY and Pb was observed for HC-SDBS-CNT (86 % SPY and 71 % Pb) and BC-SDBS-CNT (56 % SPY and 53 % Pb), whereas HC-CNT, BC-CNT, and the pristine biochars removed far less. This can be attributed to the fact that surfactant could prevent the aggregation of CNTs and thus promote the distribution and stabilization of individual CNT nanoparticle on the biochar surface to adsorb the contaminants. The observation of no significant change in Pb sorption capacities of the surfactant-dispersed CNT-modified biochars in the presence of SPY, or vice versa, was indicative of site-specific sorption interactions and a lack of significant competition for functional groups by the two sorbates. These results suggest that products of hybrid technologies, such as biochars modified with CNTs, can yield multi-sorbents and may hold excellent promise as a sustainable wastewater treatment alternative.

AB This paper assesses the applicability of a new carob waste-derived powdered activated carbon (PAC) obtained by steam activation for pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) removal in urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with activated sludge (AS) secondary treatment. The new carob-derived PAC presents chemical and textural properties similar to a high-performing commercial PAC produced from vegetable source by physical activation. The adsorption isotherms of three target PhCs, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole, spiked (at around 100 mu g/L) in mixed liquor (ML) and in clarified-ML from the AS-bioreactor of a WWTP show: (i) minor reduction of PAC capacity with real MLs compared to clarified MLs: (ii) the higher the PhC hydrophobicity, the higher the PAC adsorption capacity in both water matrices; (iii) hydrophobic interactions probably overweight electrostatic interactions between the PhCs and the slightly positively charged PAC in these real water matrices with background organics and inorganics. The PhC adsorption results with ML and clarified-ML are used to calibrate the IAST-based tracer model (TRM) and predict the new PAC performance when added to AS-bioreactor vs. in post-secondary treatment, at the PhC naturally-occurring trace concentrations. The modelling projections show (i) one needs higher PAC doses than those reported in the literature, particularly in post-treatment, and (ii) the benefits of PAC dosing to the bioreactor, with only a slightly higher PAC dose being needed when compared to its post-secondary dosing and minimising the capital investment.

AB The existence of micropollutants (MPs) including pathogens in waters poses great risks to ecological safety and human health. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have attracted considerable attention in water treatment for both disinfection and removal of emerging MPs. Here, we investigated the SO4 center dot--mediated kinetic and mechanistic aspects of simultaneous inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a typical MP with high occurrence in wastewater. In the absence of CBZ, (73.8 +/- 2.3) % E. faecalis were inactivated after 12 min of treatment, while in the presence of CBZ, (68 +/- 1.6) % of E. faecalis were inactivated, exhibiting similar inactivation efficiency with or without MP. The second. order rate constant (k) of E. faecalis reacting with SO4 center dot- was determined to be (5.42 +/- 0.64) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). In addition, two distinct types of disinfection models, one based on the quenching ratio (Q model) and the other on steady-state concentration of SO4 center dot- (R model), were developed to predict the inactivation kinetics of E. faecalis. Both models exhibited good performance for describing the disinfection of E. faecalis with RMSE of 0.065 and 0.048, respectively. Our kinetic experimental and modelling results on bacterial disinfection and degradation of CBZ were projected to offer valuable insight into future developments for typical wastewater scenarios where microorganisms and MPs coexist.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials show great potential in wastewater separation applications. In this study, zirconium-based MOFs (UiO-66) were prepared and constructed universal, high-performance, and flexible nanofiltration (NF) membrane for various dyes and antibiotics separation. The substrate was constructed by two-steps, a) doping graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the membrane casting solution containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and forming 2D-3D connecting pores by phase immersion conversion method (defined as GO@PAN), b) immersing the GO@PAN substrate into dopamine solution to self-polymerize into chain macromolecules, which obtaining good compatible and flexible substrate (defined as PGP). Moreover, the UiO-66 was synthesized via solvothermal method and subsequently coated onto the PGP substrate by vacuum-assisted filtration. Benefiting from the water stability, porous structure, and negative charge of UiO-66, the outstanding filtration performance of the UiO-66/PGP thin-film composite (TFC) membrane was achieved. The pure water permeability of the UiO66/PGP TFC membrane was 31.33 +/- 0.75 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), and the rejection rates for dye (Congo red, Methyl orange, Rhodamine B, and Methylene blue) and antibiotic (Tetracycline hydrochloride, Oxytetracycline, and Ciprofloxacin) were above 94%. Therefore, we further explored the retention mechanism of the UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane for dye and antibiotic separation (size exclusion and electrostatic interaction). More importantly, antifouling properties and long-time stability of the UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane were also evaluated. These results indicated that the prepared UiO-66/PGP TFC membrane is promising for wastewater treatment, separation, and purification in many industrial and pharmaceutical fields.

AB Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), recognized as effective methods for tertiary water treatment in view of trace organic contaminant (TrOC) removal, were investigated in this study. By assessing and comparing different ozone-based AOPs for TrOC degradation in secondary wastewater effluent, criteria for appropriate AOP application and oxidant dose are provided. In this study, the value of the minimum ozone demand for formatted hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) to react with target contaminants was proposed and determined. The ozone exposure and (OH)-O-center dot exposure were systemically investigated and compared in four types of different ozone-based AOPs (i.e., O-3 only, O-3/H2O2, O-3/UV, and O-3/H2O2/UV). The significant increase in (OH)-O-center dot exposure was achieved by means of adding H2O2 and/or UV, which results in the increase of the eliminant efficiency of TrOCs. In particular, ozone-resistance compounds (e.g., atrazine and alachlor) were removed more efficient by combination O-3 with H2O2 and UV than O-3 only, O-3/H2O2 and O-3/UV at the equal ozone dose. Such as, the removal of atrazine and alachlor tripled after 2 min of treatment in the effluent by combining O-3 with H2O2 and UV. Among the four ozone-based AOPs, the highest ozone exposure (3.27 mg min/L) was achieved by applying an O-3:DOC of 0.9 O-3 only. High ozone exposure is beneficial to enhance the abatement efficiency of high ozone-selective compounds (e.g., pentachlorophenol).

AB This study focuses on the intensification of a photochemical UVC/H2O2 system using a mili-photoreactor (NETmix) for a better and faster elimination of oxytetracycline (OTC) from urban wastewater. This miliphoto-reactor comprises a network of small cylindrical chambers and prismatic transport channels sealed by a UVC transparent quartz slab allowing unique properties. Since light has a profound effect on the photochemical process, UVC photons distribution over the reaction medium was investigated using a multiple UVC lamp design (4, 6 or 11W) allocated in parallel or perpendicular to the solution movement. In addition, the effect of other operating variables, such as oxidant dosage (100-900 mg L-1), oxidant feed configuration (single entry or continuous multi-injection) and flow rate (50-100 L h(-1)) was studied. A kinetic model able to describe the OTC oxidation by the UVC/H2O2 photochemical system in the mili-photoreactor was also developed. Moreover, matrix effect was evaluated by spiking OTC in a secondary effluent from an urban WWTP. In this case, OTC degradation was inhibited in about 2 to 3 times due to the presence of organic/inorganic substances (soluble and particulate), inherent to the real matrix, that act as scavenger of oxidant species and as UVC light filter. The NETmix mili-photoreactor presented high photochemical space time yield (PSTY) values when compared with a conventional tubular photoreactor. This highlights the NETmix capacity to enhance UVC/H2O2 processes through an homogeneous light distribution over the entire reaction medium. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressant drugs such as Venlafaxine (VFX) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODMVFX) are emerging contaminants that are commonly detected in aquatic environments, since conventional wastewater treatment plants are unable to completely remove them. They can be precursors of hazardous byproducts, such as the carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), generated upon water chlorination, as they contain the dimethylamino moiety, necessary for the formation of NDMA. In this study, the capability of three white rot fungi (Trametes versicolor, Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus) to remove both antidepressants from water and to decrease NDMA formation potential was investigated. Furthermore, transformation by-products (TPs) generated along the treatment process were elucidated and also correlated with their NDMA formation potential.
   Very promising results were obtained for T. versicolor and G. lucidum, both being able to remove up to 100% of ODMVFX. In the case of VFX, which is very recalcitrant to conventional wastewater treatment, a 70% of removal was achieved by T versicolor, along with a reduction in NDMA formation potential, thus decreasing the associated problems for human health and the environment. However, the NDMA formation potential remained practically constant during treatment with G. lucidum despite of the equally high VFX removal (70%). This difference was attributed to the generation of different TPs during both fungal treatments. For example, G. lucidum generated more ODMVFX, which actually has a higher NDMA formation potential than the parent compound itself. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research investigated the micropollutant biodegradation and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration reduction in high strength wastewater treated by two-stage activated sludge (AS) systems with (bioaugmented) and without (non-bioaugmented) acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation. The bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented systems were operated in parallel for 228 days, with three levels of concentrations of organics, nitrogen, and micropollutants in the influent: conditions 1 (low), 2 (moderate), and 3 (high). The results showed that, under condition 1, both systems efficiently removed the organic and nitrogen compounds. However, the bioaugmented system was more effective in the micropollutant biodegradation and N2O concentration reduction than the non-bioaugmented one. Under condition 2, the nitrogen and micropollutant biodegradation efficiency of the non-bioaugmented system slightly decreased, while the N2O concentration declined in the bioaugmented system. Under condition 3, the treatment performance and N2O concentration abatement were substantially lowered as the compounds concentration increased. Further analysis also showed that the acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation increased the bacterial diversity in the system. In essence, the acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation strategy was highly effective for the influent with low compounds concentration, achieving the organics and nitrogen removal efficiencies of 92-97%, relative to 71-97% of the non-bioaugmented system. The micropollutant treatment efficiency of the bioaugmented system under condition 1 was 75-92%, indicating significant improvement in the treatment performance (p < 0.05), compared with 60-79% of the non-bioaugmented system.

AB 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) is one of the most important phenolic compounds in various industries. Different technologies have been applied for 4-CP degradation in aquatic environment. Current study is focused on 4-CP degradation by the combination of UV and MnO2 for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to degrade 4-CP. MnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET). The effects of operational parameters were evaluated and their results indicated the highest performance in pH = 4.0, 1 mM PMS and 0.25 g/L MnO2. Complete degradation of 4-CP during 30 min was a representative of high performance of UV/MnO2/PMS. Kinetic study showed that the co-activation of PMS by MnO2 and UV had a synergistic effect on 4-CP degradation. MnO2 could keep its performance at least 4th cycle while Mn leaching was negligible. Bicarbonate and hydrogen phosphate ions suppressed the performance of the process in degradation of 4-CP whereas no change was observed in the presence of chloride ions. Quenching experiments showed that hydroxyl radical was dominant radical for 4-CP degradation. The results of toxicity and biodegradability tests indicated that treated sample by UV/MnO2/PMS process was relatively non-toxic and easy biodegradable. The function of UV/MnO2/PMS system for treatment of real industrial wastewaters (pharmaceutical and petrochemical wastewaters) was tested. Finally, it was concluded that hybrid activation of PMS can be a new perspective for PMS-based processes to treat industrial wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are preservatives widely used in foodstuffs, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, which have led to elevated paraben concentrations in wastewater and receiving waters. Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption and degradation of parabens in an aerobic activated sludge system. Results show that biodegradation plays a key role in removing parabens from the aerobic system of wastewater treatment plants, while adsorption on the sludge is not significant. The effects of parent paraben concentration, concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MISS), initial pH and temperature on degradation were investigated using kinetic models. The data shows that the degradation of parabens could be described by the first order kinetic model with the rate constant ranging from 0.10 to 0.88 h(-1) at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0. Paraben degradation can be enhanced by increasing the MISS concentration and temperature, or by decreasing the parent paraben concentration. Furthermore, the pH of the incubation system should be lower than 8.0. The half-lives of the parabens were estimated to range between 0.79 and 6.9 h, with methylparaben exhibiting the slowest degradation rate. During degradation in the present system, transesterification occurred, with methylparaben being the major transformation product in the incubation systems of ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben. These results were confirmed by mass spectrometry and aliphatic alcohol additive experiments. This is the first discovery of paraben transesterification in an activated sludge system, and it is associated with trace methanol in the system.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are known for their ability to enhance the removal rate of toxins while generating power. This research presents a performance assessment of MFCs for power generation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation using SMX acclimatized cultures. Experiments were performed in MFC batch mode using different SMX concentrations in synthetic wastewater. The experimental results showed that voltage generation was >400 mV up to the SMX concentration of 0.20mM (at 400 Omega external resistance). Control experiments supported the inference that biodegradation was the main process for SMX removal compared to sorption by SMX acclimatized cultures and that the process results in efficient removal of SMX in MFC mode. The specific removal rates of SMX in MFC with SMX acclimatized sludgewere 0.67, 1.37, 3.43, 7.32, and 13.36 mu m/h at initial SMX concentrations of 0.04, 0.08, 0.20, 0.39, and 0.79 mM, respectively. Moreover, the MFC was able to remove >90% of the TOC from the wastewater up to SMX concentrations of 0.08 mM. However, this TOC removal produces negative effects at higher SMX concentrations due to toxic intermediates. Microbial community analysis revealed large changes in bacterial communities at the phylum, class, and genus levels after SMX acclimatization and MFC operation. Thauera, a well-known aromatic-degrading bacteria, was the most dominant genus present in post-acclimatized conditions. In summary, this study showed that acclimatized sludge can play an important role in the biodegradation of SMX in MFCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metoprolol (MTP) is a compound of concern, considered as an emerging contaminant due to its high consumption, pseudopersistence and potential ecotoxicity. Activated sludge batch experiments were performed to evaluate the biological transformation of MTP and the formation of transformation products under different treatment conditions. Total MTP removal was obtained in aerobic conditions, and the formation of MTP known metabolites (metoprolol acid (MTPA), alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha-HMTP) and O-desmethylmetoprolol (O-DMTP)) and unknown transformation products (TPs) was investigated. The three known metabolites and two new TPs generated along the experiments were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. For the two new TPs plausible structures were proposed based on the tentative identification. MTPA had the major ratio formation for the TPs identified along the experiments (up to 40% of initial MTP concentration after 96 h treatment) and its persistence through biological treatment was proven. Ecotoxicity studies using Vihriofischeri bioluminescent bacteria in an acute toxicity test showed that MTP and its known TPs are not toxic with the exception of o-DMTP. Finally, MTP and its TPs were monitored in a full scale membrane bioreactor and in a full scale conventional urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the results were compared with those obtained in batch experiments. alpha-HMTP was detected for the first time in a WWTP influent whereas MTPA was detected in influent and effluent WWTP samples at much higher levels (up to 100 folds higher) than MTP itself remarking its high persistence.

AB The identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals in surface waters is challenging as they comprise a variety of structures which are often present at nanomolar concentrations and are temporally highly variable. Hence, a holistic passive sampling approach can be an efficient technique to overcome these limitations. In this study, a combination of 4 different passive samplers used for sampling polar (POCIS A(pharm) and POCIS Bpesticide) and apolar compounds (LDPE low density polyethylene membranes, and silicone strips) were used to profile anti-androgenic activity present in river water contaminated by a wastewater effluent. Extracts of passive samplers were analysed using HPLC fractionation in combination with an in uitro androgen receptor antagonist screen (YAS). Anti-androgenic activity was detected in extracts from silicone strips and POCIS A/B at (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 0.1 and 0.55 +/- 0.06 mg flutamide standard equivalents/sampler respectively, but was not detected in LDPE sampler extracts. POCIS samplers revealed higher selectivity for more polar anti-androgenic HPLC fractions compared with silicone strips. Over 31 contaminants were identified which showed inhibition of YAS activity and were potential antiandrogens, and these included fungicides, germicides, flame retardants and pharmaceuticals. This study reveals that passive sampling, using a combination of POCIS A and silicone samplers, is a promising tool for screening complex mixture of anti-androgenic contaminants present in surface waters, with the potential to identify new and emerging structures with endocrine disrupting activity.

AB The performance of anaerobic hybrid reactors treating an organic solvent-containing synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated under various wastewater volumetric loading rates and influent compositional changes. The biodegradation, toxicity and treatability of the target C-3 and C-4 solvents, tert-butanol isopropanol, isobutanol sec-butanol and ethyl acetate, were examined. At a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days and volumetric loading rates ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 kg COD m(-3) day(-1), the reactors achieved total and soluble COD removal efficiencies of 97-99% in less than five times the HRT. These removal rates were achieved following the introduction of target solvents not previously supplied to the reactors. However, inadequate removal of tert-butanol resulted in a decrease in the soluble COD removal efficiency to 58%. Bacterial enrichments from the reactor biomass using tert-butanol as the sole substrate proved unsuccessful, confirming that tert-butanol is poorly degradable anaerobically. Inclusion of a trace metal cocktail in the feed did not affect steady-state reactor performance, but was beneficial during changes in the influent composition. After 405 days of operation, the matrix-associated biomass contributed only a minor fraction (2-4%) of the total biomass present in both reactors. On takedown, the retained biomass present in the matrix-free section of both reactors was found to be granular in nature, despite the omission of trace elements from the influent to one of the AHRs. The specific methanogenic activity profile of the granular sludge from the trace element limited AHR was, however, significantly lower (alpha = 0.05) than that of the reference AHR.

AB The role of heterotrophic and nitrifying microorganisms in the (co-)metabolic biotransformation of 10 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) was investigated. To this aim, biotransformation assays were performed with heterotrophic and nitrifying sludge developed separately in a two-stage full-scale activated sludge system. Each stage was operated at different inflow wastewater characteristics and sludge retention times (on average 8 d and 35 d). The biotransformation capacity of each sludge was evaluated in the absence of primary substrate and in the presence of acetate and ammonium, to independently elucidate the co-metabolic role of heterotrophs and nitrifiers present in both sludges. Trimethoprim, diclofenac and carbamazepine were recalcitrant (removal < 5% after 1 d; biotransformation rate 50 mu g/g VSS center dot d) under all the tested conditions. High concentrations of caffeine, acetaminophen and iopromide were quickly biotransformed ( 80% after 1 d; > 800 mu g/g VSS center dot d) in the absence of primary substrates. The heterotrophic sludge only showed a co-metabolic effect towards erythromycin, which increased its biotransformation rate between 43% and 53% when acetate and ammonium were supplied. In contrast, when stimulated, nitrifiers and slow-growing heterotrophs present in the nitrifying sludge co-metabolically biotransformed acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen to a significant extent. Sulfamethoxazole was recalcitrant, except when the nitrifying sludge was fed with acetate (> 800 mu g/g VSS center dot d), suggesting that slow-growing heterotrophs co-metabolically biotransformed it. This study provides evidence that biotransformation of PhACs depends on several metabolic activities, as the heterotrophic activity of the nitrifying sludge, which are not only determined by the SRT but also by the feeding composition.

AB In recent years, more and more countries see irrigation using reclaimed water as an opportunity to secure and enhance agricultural production. Despite the benefits of water reuse, the scientific community raised several concerns and challenges for human health and the environment. This includes chemical risks. Effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants usually contain a wide range of organic chemicals. Such chemicals remaining in the water after the treatment process may cause hazards for human health, contaminate surrounding soil and water resources, and even compromise drinking water sources. Once crops on irrigated sites are exposed to chemicals, the potential transport to and accumulation in the edible parts of fruits and vegetables need to be controlled to rule out their introduction into the food chain. Finally, problems concerning the release of wastewater-borne antibiotics into the environment are starting to gain attention. For these reasons, agricultural irrigation should face more stringent quality requirements in order to minimize chemical risks. Combinations of measures reducing chemicals at the source, technical and natural water treatment processes especially to remove chemicals with persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), or persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) properties, good agricultural practices, and supplementary preventive measures (e.g. knowledge transfer to the stakeholders involved) will be necessary to bring about and ensure safe irrigation in the future. While internationally many regulations and guidelines for water reuse have successfully been implemented, questions remain whether the current knowledge regarding chemical risks is sufficiently considered in the regulatory context. The introduction of a new regulation for water reuse, as attempted in the European Union, poses a good opportunity to better take chemicals risks into account.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in reclaimed water can enter into soil, groundwater, and air during the irrigation of urban green spaces, leading to potential risks due to their negative effects of feminization, on root elongation, and as carcinogens. In this study, a validated HYDRUS-1D model by field experiments and an exposure model were used to simulate the distributions of 67 PPCPs detected in the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants of Beijing under two scenarios (1, uniform irrigation concentrations; 2, detected irrigation concentrations) in soil, groundwater, and air. To determine the priority ranks of the 67 PPCPs, the effect values of the PPCPs in soil, groundwater, and air were calculated on the basis of distributions and toxicity data, and then weighted and scored. Under scenario 1, roxithromycin, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, characterized by high adsorption and low volatilization and degradation, had the highest accumulations in soil, and ofloxacin, characterized by the lowest degradation and adsorption, had the highest leaching to groundwater. The highest volatilization was observed for galaxolide abbalide, tonalid, and dioctyl phthalate. Under scenario 2, based on their overall scores and priority ranks, the 67 PPCPs were divided into three groups: I, high priority; II, moderate priority; III, low priority. Of the 67 PPCPs, 17 were classified in group I, with the highest priority rankings for ofloxacin, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and sulfamethoxazole. In group III (total 33 PPCPs), 28 of the PPCPs were not of urgent concern under reclaimed water irrigation in Beijing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The photochemical transformation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists. In the current study, the photo degradation of 29 PPCPs was examined in effluents under simulated solar irradiation. Direct photodegradation, triplet state effluent organic matter ((3)EfOM*)-mediated and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot)-mediated degradation are three major pathways in the removal process. With the photodegradation of trace levels of PPCPs, the excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence intensities of the effluents were also gradually reduced. Therefore, fluorescence peaks have been identified, for the first time, as appropriate surrogates to assess the photodegradation of PPCPs. The humic-like fluorescence peak is linked to direct photolysis-labile PPCPs, such as naproxen, ronidazole, diclofenac, ornidazole, tinidazole, chloramphenicol, flumequine, ciprofloxacin, methadone, and dimetridazole. The tyrosine-like EEM peak is associated with HO center dot/CO3 center dot- -labile PPCPs, such as trimethoprim, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, carbamazepine, and cephalexin. The tryptophan-like peak is associated with (3)EfOM*-labile PPCPs, such as clenbuterol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, bisphenol A, propranolol, ractopamine, salbutamol, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, famotidine, terbutaline, and erythromycin. The reduction in EEM fluorescence correlates well with the removal of PPCPs, allowing a model to be constructed. The solar-driven removal of EEM fluorescence was applied to predict the attenuation of 11 PPCPs in five field. samples. A close correlation between the predicted results and the experimental results suggests that fluorescence may be a suitable surrogate for monitoring the solar-driven photodegradation of PPCPs in effluents.

AB Small-scale granular activated carbon (GAC) tests for the adsorption of organic micro-pollutants (OMP) were conducted with drinking water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. In both waters, three influent OMP concentration levels were tested. As long as the influent OMP concentrations are below certain thresholds, the relative breakthrough behavior is not impacted in the respective water. Accordingly, the GAC capacity for OMP is directly proportional to the influent OMP concentration in the corresponding water. The differences between the OMP breakthrough curves in drinking water and WWTP effluent can be attributed to the concentrations of the low molecular weight acid and neutral (LMW) organics of the waters. Presenting the relative OMP concentrations (c/c(0)) over the specific throughput of the LMW organics (mg LMW organics/g GAC), the OMP breakthrough curves in drinking water and WWTP effluent superimpose each other. This superimposition can be further increased if the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) of the LMW organics is considered. In contrast, using the specific throughput of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did not suffice to obtain superimposed breakthrough curves. Thus, the LMW organics are the major water constituent impacting OMP adsorption onto GAC. The results demonstrate that knowing the influent OMP and LMW organics concentrations (and UV254) of different waters, the OMP breakthroughs and GAC capacities corresponding to any water can be applied to all other waters.

AB Wastewater treatment systems are a primary pathway for pharmaceuticals (PhACs) entering the aquatic environment, which require reliable prediction through integrating the specific biodegradation processes into modeling framework. As ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are known to be able to catalyze the oxidation of a wide array of organic compounds, membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) that remove nitrogen autotrophically through aerobic ammonia oxidation by AOB followed by Anammox may be capable of removing PhACs. In this work, a mathematical model was constructed to assess the PhAC biodegradation and removal potential in MABR under various operational conditions. The cometabolic biodegradation kinetics was used to model PhAC biodegradation by both AOB and heterotrophs. Simulations show that AOB play a major role in PhAC biodegradation with minor contribution from heterotrophs under the influent condition with high-strength ammonium. Both oxygen surface loading and influent surface loading (or hydraulic retention time (HRT)) are found to significantly impact the simultaneous removal of PhACs and total nitrogen (TN) at the optimal biofilm thickness of 750 pm. Approximately 80% of PhACs can be removed in the MABR under operational conditions (oxygen surface loading and HRT) optimal for TN removal with above 75% TN removal achieved. When treating low-strength nitrogenous wastewater, PhAC removal efficiency decreases substantially due to the lower abundance of AOB. The presence of organic matters would substantially increase PhAC removal efficiency mainly via heterotrophs biodegradation pathway, but would suppress the Anammox activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this work was to analyse the potentialities of an integrated membrane system for the recovery, purification and concentration of polyphenols from olive mill wastewater (OMW). The proposed system included some well-known membrane operations such as microfiltration (MF) and nanofiltration (NF), as well as others not yet investigated for this specific application, such as osmotic distillation (OD) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD).
   The OMW was directly submitted to a MF operation without preliminary centrifugation. This step allowed to achieve a 91% and 26% reduction of suspended solids and total organic carbon (TOC), respectively. Moreover, 78% of the initial content of polyphenols was recovered in the permeate stream.
   The MF permeate was then submitted to a NF treatment. Almost all polyphenols were recovered in the produced permeate solution, while TOC was reduced from 15 g/L to 5.6 g/L. A concentrated solution enriched in polyphenols was obtained by treating the NF permeate by OD. In particular, a solution containing about 0.5 g/L of free low molecular weight polyphenols, with hydroxytyrosol representing 56% of the total, was produced by using a calcium chloride dihydrate solution as brine. The obtained solution is of interest for preparing formulations to be used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. Besides the OD process, VMD was applied as another way for concentrating the NF permeate and the performance of both processes was compared in terms of evaporation fluxes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI New techniques for solvent recovery and elimination of wastewater

SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB The pharmaceutical and chemical process industries are concerned with controlling volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for several reasons: to meet environmental regulations, for increased worker safety, and to minimize product losses. Various methods can be used including flaring and carbon adsorption. These techniques are end-of-the-pipe solutions and are not integral with the process operation itself
   An improved technique for the recovery of solvents during reaction, distillation, evaporation, drying, filtration, mixing, and other vacuum operations is the APOVAC vacuum/gas compressor system. The skid-mounted, engineered package is based upon a single stage liquid ring vacuum pump. The system allows for the recovery and reuse of clean solvent with minimum air emissions and zero liquid emissions. VOC and biological oxygen demand (BOD) regulations are met by this technology.
   The paper reviews the technical details of the system and presents test results and on-site operational data. Specific case histories involving methylene chloride recovery and acid/toxic gas neutralizations are also included.
   In the chemical processing industry (CPI) the generation of vacuum is a necessity. Many chemical processes take place more easily, more quickly and more efficiently under vacuum than tinder atmospheric pressure, thus allowing better product quality at lower production cost. If it is a "wet" process involving the use of solvents then solvent recovery becomes an important consideration because of cost savings associated with its recovery as well as environmental benefits.
   These objectives have stimulated the development of the APOVAC system concept which is based on the principle of closed loops or circuits. Since its development, the APOVAC system has enhanced today's chemical process technology through solvent recovery and recycling, elimination of wastewater effluent, and reduction of gas emissions thus contributing to a technically efficient and environmentally acceptable operation.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the popular alternative treatment methods for wastewater. It utilizes semiconductor material as the catalyst and metal oxide such as zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), emerged as the commonly used catalyst. In this study, a series of biogenic ZnO NPs was fabricated through precipitation method with pullulan as the biomaterial. The amount of zinc salt in the presence of pullulan was varied to study its impact on the generated ZnO NPs. The results showed that without pullulan, the average particle size of ZnO NPs obtained was 110.86 nm. With 0.84 M zinc salt in 50 g/L of pullulan, the ZnO NPs average particle size significantly reduced to 58.13 nm. The surface area of all synthesized ZnO NPs ranging from 14.84 to 19.99 m(2) g =(1). The photocatalytic activities of all synthesized ZnO NPs were evaluated through the photodegradation of two drugs, amoxicillin (AMX) and paracetamol (PCT). Through the comparison of drugs' photodegradation with all synthesized ZnO NPs, ZnO NPs produced with 0.67 M zinc salt in 50 g/L of pullulan showed the highest degradation percentage of 85.7% and 96.8% for AMX and PCT respectively. The best photodegradation conditions for the drugs were 30 ppm drugs concentration, pH 9 (for AMX) and pH 5 (for PCT) and 50 mg catalyst dosage. Based on these results, biogenic ZnO NPs has high potential to be used in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. (c) 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

ID CHEMICALS
AB Biodegradation is the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simpler molecules like carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. Biodegradation studies of pharmaceuticals are initially done to assess which pharmaceuticals are persistent in the environment. Whole pharmaceuticals or their metabolites are excreted from the human body via urine or fecal matter after administration. These go into the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) and are later released into the environment with the treated wastewater. Recent studies have reported a number of pharmaceuticals in the ecosystem and the effects of these on non-target species has become an issue of environmental concern. The biodegradation studies of eight pharmaceuticals were carried out in this research. The choice of pharmaceuticals was based on the most commonly prescribed medications at the University of Zambia (UNZA) Clinic in seven therapeutic groups: anti-hypertensives, antibiotic, antimalarial drugs, anti-tuberculosis, antihelminthics, antifungals and antiretroviral drugs. The biodegradability tests were carried out using a modified carbon dioxide evolution method (modified Sturm test). The inoculum was derived from the secondary effluent of the UNZA WWTP plant and Dextrose monohydrate was used as a system control. Using this guideline, the system control, dextrose monohydrate biodegraded 77 +/- 0.270% in seven days. All the pharmaceuticals except ciprofloxacin were found to be non-biodegradable: Atenolol degraded 6.8 +/- 0.026%, ketoconazole degraded 1.0 +/- 0.003%, isoniazid/rifampicin degraded 0.8 +/- 0.003%, mebendazole degraded 13.0 +/- 0.050%, nevirapine degraded 1.3 +/- 0.005%, pen-v degraded 1.0 +/- 0.004% and quinine sulfate degraded 1.8 +/- 0.008%. Ciprofloxacin showed a negative carbon dioxide evolution and it was noted that bacteria were not viable as the drug proved to be very potent against bacterial strains in the inoculum used.

AB Microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands (CW-MFCs) with different circuit operation conditions and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were constructed to evaluate their ability to remove and accumulate pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (sulfadiazine (SDZ), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBP)) during four months running process. The abundance level of corresponding sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was also investigated. The results showed that closed circuit operation of CW-MFC contributed to the decrease in mass loading of COD, NH4+-N, PPCPs, and wastewater toxicity in the effluent. Additionally, closed circuit operation with low HRT contributed to enhancing selected PPCP mass accumulation on electrodes by electro-adsorption, and thus the higher sulfonamide ARG abundance was detected in the electrodes and effluent. Moreover, the composition of bacteria was greatly influenced by the mass accumulation of PPCPs revealed by redundancy analysis results. Procrustes analysis results further demonstrated that bacterial community contributed greatly to the ARGs profiles. Therefore, ARGs with their host bacteria revealed by network analysis were partially deposited on electrode substrates, and thus ARGs were effectively accumulated on electrodes. Function analysis of the bacterial community from PICRUSt predicted metagenomes revealed that closed circuit mode enhanced the abundances of the function genes of metabolic and the multiple ARGs, suggesting that closed circuit operation exhibited positive effects on metabolic process and ARG accumulation in CW-MFC system.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) that is selective to ketoprofen was synthesized and applied in the adsorption of the target compound from water. The MIP was synthesized using a bulk polymerization method at high temperatures (60-80 degrees C), where ketoprofen, 2-vinylpyridine, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, toluene and 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) were used as template, functional monomer, cross-linker, porogen and initiator, respectively. Non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized similarly to the MIP but in the absence of ketoprofen. From molecular dynamics simulation, the nature of interactions that occurred between the template and the functional monomer were found to be based on hydrogen bonding. This was confirmed experimentally, where a high extraction efficiency of >= 90% was obtained at acidic conditions (pH 5) due to the protonation of ketoprofen. A contact time of 45 min was sufficient for the maximum adsorption of ketoprofen from 10 mL spiked water using 8 mg of the adsorbent. MIP showed greater selectivity than NIP by achieving a relative selectivity coefficient of 7.7 towards ketoprofen in the presence of structurally related pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the order of sorption onto the MIPs from water was ketoprofen > fenoprofen > gemfibrozil. From a modelling perspective, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model gave the best fit, with maximum adsorption capacity of 8.24 mg.g(-1) and sorption rate constant of 0.25 mg.g(-1).min(-1) for MIP. This was translated to chemisorption of ketoprofen onto the homogeneous MIP binding sites. This work demonstrated the great potential of MIP in selective recognition of ketoprofen from wastewater relative to closely related compounds.

AB In this study, N-Cu co-doped TiO2 was decorated on the single-walled carbon nano-tube (marked as N-Cu co-doped TiO2@CNTs) via two-step sol-gel/hydrothermal synthesis method for the first time as a novel photocatalyst in coupling with ultrasound (US) waves. The catalyst properties were characterized via BET, Raman, FESEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, EIS, PL, TGA, UV-Vis DRS, EDX and EDS dot mapping. These techniques confirmed the successful doping of both N and Cu elements on the CNTs impregnated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The investigation of effective operational parameters demonstrated that the total removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMXZ) could be achieved under pH of 6.0, catalyst dosage of 0.8 g/L, light intensity of 200 W, US power of 200 W, and initial SMXZ concentration of 60 mg/L within 60 min. SMXZ degradation kinetics over sono-photocatalytic process were in a good agreement with pseudo-first-order model. Quenching experiments illustrated that HO center dot and O2(center dot-) active species were more effective species for SMXZ degradation. The synthesized sono-photocatalyst could be recycled after six consecutive cycles of SMXZ degradation with an insignificant decrease in perfor- mance. A tentative mechanism and pathway for SMXZ were formulated. Pharmaceutical wastewater was treated through the optimum degradation conditions which showed that the sono-photocatalytic degradation eliminated 93% of COD and 89% of TOC within 180 min.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria have been used in this study for zirconia nanoparticles synthesis through green technology for adsorption driven bioremediation of tetracycline from wastewater. The characterization of synthesized nano zirconia has been performed by employing dynamic light scattering, field emission-transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and point of zero charge analysis. The zirconia nanoparticles have shown average particle size similar to 15 nm, monoclinic and tetragonal crystal structure with 6.41 nm of crystallite size, the presence of elemental zirconium and oxygen, and the occurrence of functional groups like 0-Zr-OH, Zr-O-Zr and Zr-O bonds. The zirconia nanoparticles mediated adsorption of tetracycline has been found to be effective at solution pH 6.0 and in a very less contact time 15 min. Strong electrostatic interaction between zwitterionic form of tetracycline and protonated surface of zirconia nanoparticles is the governing adsorption mechanism in this study. The kinetic study has been performed on the basis of the tetracycline adsorption process revealing that the adsorption phenomenon follows pseudo-second order kinetic, further suggesting chemisorption of tetracycline over zirconia nanoparticles. The Langmuir isotherm model has been found to be the best fitted model among the all isotherm models indicating the involvement of monolayer uptake of tetracycline on the surface of zirconia nanoparticles. Moreover, the maximum tetracycline adsorption capacity of zirconia nanoparticles calculated by the Langmuir isotherm model is close to 526.32 mg/g. This finding is quite reasonable to accept that zirconia nanoparticle may be used as an alternative adsorbent to mitigate the tetracycline contamination in wastewater.

AB Herein, we developed the waste-derived adsorbent, mesoporous Schumannianthus dichotomus (MSD) and used for the exploitation of Ibuprofen (IBP) in an economic and reliable way. The developed adsorbent was characterized by various physicochemical and spectroscopic analyses. Relatively higher surface area of 1058 m(2)/g, pore volume of 0.9909 cm(3)/g and average article size of 39.09 mu m justified the utilization of the developed material for the removal of IBP from aqueous phase. The effect of ionic strength (SO42-, Cl-, and NO3-), divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and surfactant on the removal of IBP onto MSD was investigated. Adsorption equilibrium is attained in 60 min with adsorbent load of 1.8 g/L. The removal efficiency of MSD is around 98% with sequestering capacity of 243.90 mg/g. Thermodynamic investigation revealed the adsorption process to be exothermic, (Delta H = -8.729 kJ/mol) and spontaneous in nature (Delta G = -7.06 kJ/mol) with a decrease in the randomness (Delta S = -5.57 JK/mol) at the solid/liquid interface. The energy recovered from the adsorbent-loaded IBP in terms of higher heating value (17.15 mJ/kg) further enhanced its utilization. The low cost of MSD (USD 14.39 per kg) also justified its utilization for wastewater treatment in an economic perspective. Density Function Theory studies showed that a weak interaction occurs between IBP and the developed activated carbon, MSD. The exothermic character of IBP adsorption onto MSD was confirmed by experimental investigation.

AB Knowledge on the functional characteristics and temporal variation of anaerobic bacterial populations is important for better understanding of the microbial process of two-stage anaerobic reactors. However, owing to the high diversity of anaerobic bacteria, close attention should be prioritized to the frequently abundant bacteria that were defined as core bacteria and putatively functionally important. In this study, using MiSeq sequencing technology, the core bacterial community of 98 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was determined in a two-stage upflow blanket filter reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewater. The core bacterial community accounted for 61.66% of the total sequences and accurately predicted the sample location in the principal coordinates analysis scatter plot as the total bacterial OTUs did. The core bacterial community in the first-stage (FS) and second-stage (SS) reactors were generally distinct, in that the FS core bacterial community was indicated to be more related to a higher-level fermentation process, and the SS core bacterial community contained more microbes in syntrophic cooperation with methanogens. Moreover, the different responses of the FS and SS core bacterial communities to the temperature shock and influent disturbance caused by solid contamination were fully investigated. Co-occurring analysis at the Order level implied that Bacteroidales, Selenomonadales, Anaerolineales, Syneristales, and Thermotogales might play key roles in anaerobic digestion due to their high abundance and tight correlation with other microbes. These findings advance our knowledge about the core bacterial community and its temporal variability for future comparative research and improvement of the two-stage anaerobic system operation.

AB Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) may provide an alternative solution for the removal of co-contamination between antibiotics and heavy metals from livestock and poultry wastewater. A hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate interaction of tetracyclines (TCs) and copper (Cu) on growth of E. crassipes, removal of TCs and Cu by plants and their fates in solution. After 20 days, plant growth, concentrations and accumulation of Cu and TCs in plants, removal by plants, and dissipation in solution were significantly influenced by interaction of Cu and TCs. Influence of only Cu or TCs on plant growth was not significant, except for TCs at 15 mg L-1 which produced a negative effect on plant biomass. The presence of low-Cu and high-TCs acted synergistically to promote the negative effect of TCs on plant biomass, but increasing Cu concentration partially alleviated the adverse effect. Co-contamination of low-concentration Cu and TCs could exert antagonistic effects on the removal and accumulation of Cu and TCs by plants; in contrast, synergistic effects were found for the combination of high-concentration Cu and TCs. The Cu/TCs in solution could effectively be removed using E. crassipes. Plants significantly enhanced dissipation of TCs in solution. Hence, interaction of TCs and Cu should be taken into consideration when judging (1) an ecotoxicological potential of TCs and Cu residues in aquatic environments, and (2) removal efficiency of TCs and Cu in phytoremediation.

AB Removal efficiencies of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are usually evaluated from mass balance calculations using a small number of observations drawn from short sampling campaigns. Since micropollutant loads can vary greatly in both influent and effluent and reactor tanks exhibit specific hydraulic residence times, these short-term approaches are particularly prone to yield erroneous removal values. A detailed investigation of micropollutant transit times at full-scale and on how this affects mass balancing results was still lacking. The present study used hydraulic residence time distributions to scrutinize the match of influent loads to effluent loads of 10 polar micropollutants with different influent dynamics in a full-scale WWTP. Prior hydraulic modeling indicated that a load sampled over one day in the effluent is composed of influent load fractions of five preceding days. Results showed that the error of the mass balance can be reduced with increasing influent sampling duration. The approach presented leads to a more reliable estimation of the removal efficiencies of those micropollutants which can be constantly detected in influents, such as pharmaceuticals, but provides no advantage for pesticides due to their sporadic occurrence. The mismatch between sampled influent and effluent loads was identified as a major error source and an explanation was provided for the occurrence of negative mass balances regularly reported. This study indicates that the accurate determination of global removal values is only feasible in full-scale investigations with sampling durations much longer than 1 day. In any case, the uncertainty of these values needs to be reported when used in removal assessment, model selection or validation.

AB A comprehensive analysis of Turkish antibiotic data was conducted to evaluate potential environmental risks associated with antibiotic consumption in Turkey for year 2007. Antibiotics were defined for systemic use or group J01 of the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Total emissions and prescriptions for each ATC group were classified separately into 17 different J01 categories and three forms of medication (capsule/tablets, injectables and suspensions). Capsules and tablets were found as the most emitted form of medication in year 2007, with a total emission rate of about 585.5 tons/year (76%). Total antibiotic emission rates including all forms of medications were determined to be about 664.2 tons/year (86%) and 110.1 tons/year (14%) for adult and pediatric patients, respectively. An environmental risk assessment of 8 human antibiotics was conducted according to the EU draft guidance (CEC/III/5504/94, draft 6, version 4) and the risk was indicated by the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for the aquatic environment. Available acute and chronic toxicity data were collected from the open peer-reviewed literature to derive PNEC. Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were then calculated for 8 pharmaceutical substances. PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded 1.0 for beta-lactams (cephalosporins and penicillins), fluoroquinolones, macrolides and aminoglycosides. The findings of this study concluded that the release of these compounds from wastewater treatment plants may potentially be of an important environmental concern based on today's use of antibiotics in Turkey.

AB Bioremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated wastewater using microalgae has attracted increasing attention. Cyanobacteria, which are important prokaryotic microalgae, are widely distributed in different water environments, and have the advantages of simple culture and a fast growth rate. However, studies on either the toxicity of pharmaceutical contaminants (PhCs) to cyanobacteria or the removal of PhCs by cyanobacteria are scarce. In this study, carbamazepine (CBZ) and Spirulina platensis were selected as model PhCs and cyanobacteria, respectively. CBZ (>1 mg/L) had toxicity effects on S. platensis, showing maximal growth inhibition (34.0%) at 100 mg/L after 10 days of cultivation. At CBZ 25 mg/L S. platensis showed a trend similar to that of eukaryotic microalgae in increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and content of chlorophylls, carotenoids, carbohydrates, and lipids. These results indicated that S. platensis had a similar protective mechanism to CBZ toxicity as that of the eukaryotic microalgae. Increasing CBZ concentration (50-100 mg/L) significanctly decreased these biochemical characteristics and photosynthetic activity owing to the serious damage of the structure and function of S. platensis. However, with increasing cultivation lime, the growth and photosynthetic activity of S. platensis recovered from the toxicity of CBZ. S. platensis showed a maximum of 30.97 +/- 1.30% removal of CBZ (1 mg/L), mainly through biodegradation. Addition of 0.3 mg/L glucose enhanced this removal efficiency to 50.13 +/- 2.51% via co-metabolism. These findings indicated that S. platensis can be used for the removal of CBZ or other PhCs from wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The removal efficiencies (REs) of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (six antibiotics-clarithromycin, ofioxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim -, four beta-blockers -atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol-, two antihypertensives/diuretics -furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide-, three lipid regulators -bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil-, and four psychiatric medications -carbamazepine, diazepam, lorazepam and paroxetine) were ascertained in a pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A(2)O) system treating urban wastewater, long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of bacteria, archaea and fungi communities in the activated sludge. The results showed that mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) were operational parameters significantly influencing the REs of five of the analyzed PhACs in the A(2)O system. Biota-environment (BIO-ENV) analysis revealed strong correlations between population shifts of the activated sludge community and the REs of PhACs of the different pharmaceutical families. Increased REs of clarithromycin, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were concomitant to higher relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes classified within the Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), while those of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomethylovorans (Euryarchaea) correlated positively with the REs of up to seven PhACs belonging to different therapeutic groups.

AB The bactericide triclosan and methyl triclosan, an environmental transformation product thereof, were detected in lakes and in a river in Switzerland at concentrations of up to 74 and 2 ng L-1, respectively. Both compounds were emitted via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), with methyl triclosan probably being formed by biological methylation. A regional mass balance for a lake (Greifensee) indicated significant removal of triclosan by processes other than flushing. Laboratory experiments showed that triclosan in the dissociated form was rapidly decomposed in lake water when exposed to sunlight (half-life less than 1 h in August at 47degrees latitude). Methyl triclosan and nondissociated triclosan, however, were relatively stable toward photodegradation. Modeling these experimental data for the situation of lake Greifensee indicated that photodegradation can account for the elimination of triclosan from the lake and suggested a seasonal dependence of the concentrations (lower in summer, higher in winter), consistent with observed concentrations. Although emissions of methyl triclosan from WWTPs were only approximate to2% relative to those of triclosan, its predicted concentration relative to triclosan in the epilimnion of the lake increases to 30% in summer. Passive sampling with semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) indicated the presence of methyl triclosan in lakes with inputs from anthropogenic sources but not in a remote mountain lake. Surprisingly, no parent triclosan was observed in the SPMDs from these lakes. Methyl triclosan appears to be preferentially accumulated in SPMDs under the conditions in these lakes, leading to concentrations comparable to those of persistent chlorinated organic pollutants.

ID POPULATION
AB Pharmaceuticals have been finding their way into our environment for a long time. The pharmaceutical compounds, after their final rounds of clinical trials, end up in the body, where finally they are excreted into treated wastewater, agricultural runoff, and biosolids and manure that are used as fertilizers. The compounds affect other living systems such as fishes, plants and aquatic life, showing drastic affects on their populations. Concentration-wise, pharmaceuticals represent just a small fraction of the thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Even though medications have been in the environment for as long as people have been taking them, it is only through the advent of advanced analytical instrumentation and techniques that scientists have been able to detect them in the wild.

AB This work investigated an innovative alternative to improve municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent (MWWTP effluent) quality aiming at the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (caffeine, carbendazim, and losartan potassium), and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), as well as disinfection (E. coli). Persulfate was used as an alternative oxidant in the solar photo-Fenton process (solar/Fe/S2O82-) due to its greater stability in the presence of matrix components. The efficiency of solar/Fe/S2O82- at neutral pH using intermittent iron additions is unprecedented in the literature. At first, solar/Fe/S2O82- was performed in a solar simulator (30 W m(-2)) leading to more than 60% removal of CECs, and the intermittent iron addition strategy was proved effective. Then, solar/Fe/S2O82- and solar/Fe/H2O2 were compared in semi-pilot scale in a raceway pond reactor (RPR) and a cost analysis was performed. Solar/Fe/S2O82- showed higher efficiencies of removal of target CECs (55%), E. coli (3 log units), and ARB (3 to 4 log units) within 1.9 kJ L-1 of accumulated irradiation compared to solar/Fe/H2O2 (CECs, 49%; E. coli, 2 log units; ARB, 1 to 3 log units in 2.5 kJ L-1). None of the treatments generated acute toxicity upon Allivibrio fischeri. Lower total cost was obtained using S2O82- (0.6 euro m(-3)) compared to H2O2 (1.2 euro m(-3)). Therefore, the iron intermittent addition aligned to the use of persulfate is suitable for MWWTP effluent quality improvement at neutral pH.

AB The ozonation of 90 chemically diverse organic micropollutants (OMPs) including four classes of illicit drugs and their metabolites was studied in pure buffered water, tap water and wastewater effluent at three specific ozone doses and three pH levels. The second order rate constants for the reaction of 40 OMPs with ozone were known and span across 8 orders of magnitude, from below 1 M(-1)s(-1)to above 10(7)M(-1)s(-1). 47 of the tested OMPs were removed to at least 90% at the highest specific ozone dose of 0.3 mM O(3)per mM C at pH 7. However, most illicit drugs, including cocainics, amphetamines and ecstasy-group compounds, were ozone-resistant due to their lack of ozone-reactive functional groups. Exceptions included some opioids and the cocaine biomarker anhydroecgonine methylester which contain olefinic bonds and/or activated benzene rings. Different removal trends at different pH for OMPs were due to the combined effect of target compound speciation and ozone stability, leading to elimination of less than 70% for all OMPs at pH 11. In both tap water and wastewater effluent scavenging by matrix components led to lower ozone exposure compared to pure buffered water and consequently lower removal of OMPs. This multi-compound ozonation study utilised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to provide a large dataset on the removal of environmentally relevant OMPs, including those of interest for drinking water regulations. Besides including pharmaceutically active compounds that have not been studied with ozone before (e.g.gliclazide, anhydroecgonine methylester, quetiapine, 6-monoacetylmorphine), this study simultaneously shows ozonation data for a wide range of illicit drugs.

AB Pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, have received increasing global concern, due to their intensive use in the environment and potential harm to ecological system as well as human health. Among various antibiotics, fluoroquinolones are of extreme interest, since they are broad-spectrum antibacterials with agrowing demand in hospitals, households, and veterinary applications. Wastewater discharge from conventional wastewater treatment plants isthe main source of fluoroquinolone in the aquatic environment. Removal of fluoroquinolone residue from aquatic environment is, therefore, considered as a priority and serves as an important study. For the degradation of FQs in aqueous solution, interesting remedy processes are required such as oxidation-degradation process in which formed intermediates mineralized into CO2, water, and mineral species. The electron transfer reactions and their mechanisms are of much importance in understanding various types of biochemical, pharmaceutical and industrial reactions. Kinetics has played a significant role in understanding the intricacies' of such reactions. Nanosized colloidal manganese dioxide, hexacyanoferrate(III), diperiodatocuprate(III), potassium permanganate etc. used as effective oxidants for oxidative degradation of different fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents in aqueous acidic/alkaline system. In this regard, we investigated a kinetic study of oxidation of moxifloxacin (MF) by diperiodatocuprate(III) (DPC) in aqueous alkaline medium. The reaction was first order with respect to [DPC] and less than unity order with [MF]. The pseudo first order rate constant (k(obs)) changes differently under different concentration of alkali. The results indicates at higher hydroxyl ion concentration DPC complex exist in CuL whereas at lower hydroxyl ion concentration in form of Cu(HL)(2). The thermodynamic parameters associated with the oxidation reaction have been evaluated and discussed.

AB We predicted the possible direct and indirect phototransformation kinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBU) and diclofenac (DIC) in river water, based on data of water chemistry obtained for the Guadiana River near Badajoz (Southwestern Spain) during a year-round sampling campaign. The three compounds were chosen, (i) because they occurred at the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Badajoz, as well as in river water sampled 1 km downstream of the WWTP, and (ii) because their photochemical fate in surface waters is known well enough to be modelled. The predicted phototransformation kinetics would be negligible in winter and fastest in April-August, with comparable rate constants in April through August despite differences in sunlight irradiance. Favourable water chemistry would in fact offset the lower irradiance, and vice versa. Half-life times of at least three weeks - one month are predicted for CBZ and IBU. Photodegradation may be an important attenuation pathway for biorecalcitrant CBZ, while IBU photochemistry is unlikely to be competitive with other processes including biodegradation. The predicted DIC photochemical half-life times of 7-10 days in April-August would be comparable with the biodegradation kinetics data reported in the literature. Photochemistry might not induce extensive phototransformation of xenobiotics in the Guadiana River under normal flow conditions, but it could become important in the case of low flow produced by water scarcity.

AB Fe2O3/graphite (Fe2O3/C) and nano-TiO2-coated glass bead were prepared by impregnation and sol-gel method respectively and employed as the catalyst of a novel three-dimensional electrode photoelectrocatalytic (3-D PEC) system. The photoexcited electrons can transfer from TiO2, Fe2O3 to counter electrode. It improves the migration of photoexcited charges, retards the fast recombination of electron-hole, and increases the lifetime of photogenerated holes (h(+)). In addition, the cycle reaction of Fe3+/Fe2+ on Fe2O3/C surface enhanced the Fenton reaction which can produce more hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and promote the capacity of mineralization of the pollutants. This novel 3-D PEC system showed excellent performance for the degradation of berberine chloride form (BCF). At the pH value of 3, 93% BCF was removed within 60 min; besides, 98.64% COD removal rate, 78.96% mineralization, 21.47% mineralization current efficiency, and just 3.16 kW h g(-1) TOC energy cost were obtained in 120 min. In this study, we proposed the 3-D PEC mechanism. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and scavenging experiments suggest that the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) are superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)), center dot OH, and h(+), while the role of sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) is insignificant. This work provides a new dimension for the design of reactors for wastewater treatment and the construction of the 3-D PEC system can potentially be utilized in water purification.

AB Veterinary pharmaceuticals, widely used in intensive livestock production, may contaminate surface waters. Identifying their sources and pathways in watersheds is difficult because i) most veterinary pharmaceuticals are used in human medicine as well and ii) septic or sewer wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can release pharmaceuticals into surface water, even in agricultural headwater watersheds. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of animal-specific, mixed-use, and human-specific pharmaceuticals, from agricultural headwaters with intensive livestock production and a WWTP to a watershed used for Water Framework Directive monitoring. Grab sampling was performed during one hydrological year upstream and downstream from a WWTP and at three dates in seven nested watersheds with areas of 1.9-84.1 km(2). Twenty pharmaceuticals were analyzed. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected at all sampling dates upstream and downstream from theWWTP and at concentrations higher than those of human-specific pharmaceuticals. The predominance of animal-specific and mixed-use pharmaceuticals vs. human-specific pharmaceuticals observed at these sampling points was confirmed at the other sampling points. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected mainly during runoff events and periods of manure spreading. A large percentage of mixed-use pharmaceuticals could come from animal sources, but it was difficult to determine. Mixed-use and human-specific pharmaceuticals predominated in the largest watersheds when runoff decreased. In areas of intensive livestock production, mitigation actions should focus on agricultural headwater watersheds to decrease the number of pathways and the transfer volume of veterinary pharmaceuticals, which can be the main contaminants.

AB Persulfate oxidation processes, with and without activation using ultraviolet light (respectively UV/PS and PS) have the potential to degrade anthropogenic chemicals in water. However, little is known about the impact of PS or UV/PS pre-oxidation on downstream formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). In this study the three antibiotic chloramphenicols (chloramphenicol and two of its analogues [thiamphenicol and florfenicol], referred to collectively as CAPs), which frequently occur in wastewater-impacted source waters used by drinking water treatment plants, were selected as model antibiotic compounds. The formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection by-products, including halomethanes, haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes, during chlorination and chloramination preceded by PS and UV/PS was investigated. No significant concentrations of haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes were detected during chlorination. During chloramination chloramphenicol formed a considerable amount of dichloronitromethane (e.g., 3.44 +/- 0.33% mol/mol at NH2Cl dose = 1 mM) and trichloronitromethane (e.g., 0.79 +/- 0.07% mol/mol at NH2Cl dose = 1 mM), compared with THM and HAN formation. PS pre-oxidation achieved a statistically significant reduction in trichloromethane formation from chlorination, and in HAN and HNM formation from chloramination. Although UV/PS slightly increased dichloroacetonitrile formation during chloramination, it significantly decreased dichloronitromethane and trichloronitromethane formation during chloramination. Overall, the use of PS and IN/PS has the potential to have contrasting impacts on DBP formation in heavily wastewater-impacted waters, depending on the disinfection method. Hence, their application needs to be carefully balanced against the downstream effect on DBP formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB PAC adsorption is a widespread option for the removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from secondary effluent. For an optimal exploitation of the adsorption capacity, PAC recirculation is nowadays a common practice, although the mechanistic interrelations of the complex recirculation process are not fully resolved. In this work, extensive multi-stage batch adsorption testing with repeated PAC and coagulant dosage was performed to evaluate the continuous-flow recirculation system. Partly loaded PAC showed a distinct amount of remaining capacity, as OMP and DOC removals considerably increased with each additional adsorption stage. At a low PAC dose of 10 mg PAC L-1, removals of benzotriazole and carbamazepine were shown to rise from <40% in the first stage up to >80% in the 11th stage at 30 min adsorption time per stage. At a high PAC dose of 30 mg PAC L-1, OMP and DOC removals were significantly higher and reached 98% (for benzotriazole and carbamazepine) after 11 stages. Coagulant dosage showed no influence on OMP removal, whereas a major part of DOC removal can be attributed to coagulation. Multi-stage adsorption is particularly beneficial for small PAC doses and significant PAC savings are feasible. A new model approach for predicting multi-stage OMP adsorption on the basis of a single-stage adsorption experiment was developed. It proved to predict OMP removals and PAC loadings accurately and thus contributes towards understanding the PAC recirculation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With rising demands on water supplies necessitating water reuse, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is often used to irrigate agricultural lands. Emerging contaminants, like pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), are frequently found in effluent due to limited removal during WWTP processes. Concern has arisen about the environmental fate of PPCPs, especially regarding plant uptake. The aim of this study was to analyze uptake of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, and carbamazepine in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants that were spray-irrigated with WWTP effluent. Wheat was collected before and during harvest, and plants were divided into grain and straw. Subsamples were rinsed with methanol to remove compounds adhering to surfaces. All plant tissues underwent liquid-solid extraction, solid-phase extraction cleanup, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Residues of each compound were present on most plant surfaces. Ofloxacin was found throughout the plant, with higher concentrations in the straw (10.2 +/- 7.05 ng g(-1)) and lower concentrations in the grain (2.28 +/- 0.89 ng g(-1)). Trimethoprim was found only on grain or straw surfaces, whereas carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were concentrated within the grain (1.88 +/- 2.11 and 0.64 +/- 0.37 ng g(-1), respectively). These findings demonstrate that PPCPs can be taken up into wheat plants and adhere to plant surfaces when WWTP effluent is spray-irrigated. The presence of PPCPs within and on the surfaces of plants used as food sources raises the question of potential health risks for humans and animals.

AB A submerged membrane bioreactor was set up to investigate the removal efficiencies of five pharmaceuticals from synthetic domestic wastewater. Batch experiments were conducted with sterilized sludge and activated sludge to explore the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation for those pharmaceuticals. Notable difference of those pharmaceuticals removal efficiencies was observed, at about 92.2, 90.0, 55.4, 38.5 and 3.2% for acetaminophen, 17 beta-estradiol, naproxen, diclofenac sodium, and carbamazepine, respectively. Results of batch adsorption experiments via sterilized sludge showed that the removal efficiencies of five pharmaceuticals by sludge adsorption were 7.9, 68.2, 60.1, 40.1 and 71.5%, respectively, which were positively correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficients. Results of batch experiments via activated sludge showed that 83.4% of acetaminophen, 98.0% of 17 beta-estradiol, and 46.8% of naproxen were removed through the combination of sludge adsorption and biodegradation, while adsorption accumulation in sludge phase was only 1.8, 1.3 and 7.0%. This implies that the removals of these three drugs were mainly achieved by biodegradation. The total removal efficiency of diclofenac sodium was 19.7%, and the contributions of sludge adsorption and biodegradation were 14.9 and 4.8%, which indicated that the removal of diclofenac sodium was mainly achieved by sludge adsorption. The total removal efficiency of carbamazepine was only 8.9% and this implies that neither sludge adsorption nor biodegradation is effective for its removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In highly urbanized areas, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent can represent a significant component of freshwater ecosystems. As it is impossible for the composition of WWTP effluent to match the composition of the receiving system, the potential exists for effluent to significantly impact the chemical and biological characteristics of the receiving ecosystem. We assessed the impacts of WWTP effluent on the size, activity, and composition of benthic microbial communities by comparing two distinct field sites in the Chicago metropolitan region: a highly urbanized river receiving effluent from a large WWTP and a suburban river receiving effluent from a much smaller WWTP. At sites upstream of effluent input, the urban and suburban rivers differed significantly in chemical characteristics and in the composition of their sediment bacterial communities. Although effluent resulted in significant increases in inorganic nutrients in both rivers, surprisingly, it also resulted in significant decreases in the population size and diversity of sediment bacterial communities. Tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed significant effects of effluent on sediment bacterial community composition in both rivers, including decreases in abundances of Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfococcus, Dechloromonas, and Chloroflexi sequences and increases in abundances of Nitro-spirae and Sphingobacteriales sequences. The overall effect of the WWTP inputs was that the two rivers, which were distinct in chemical and biological properties upstream of the WWTPs, were almost indistinguishable downstream. These results suggest that WWTP effluent has the potential to reduce the natural variability that exists among river ecosystems and indicate that WWTP effluent may contribute to biotic homogenization.

AB Cyprus is currently the leading country in antibiotic consumption among all European Union member countries and is likely to have a high consumption of pharmaceuticals overall. This reconnaissance type of project sought to investigate the occurrence of 16 pharmaceuticals, six known or suspected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), two flame retardants, one insect repellant, and one fragrance for the first time in water supplies of Cyprus. Groundwater samples from sites that were located beneath farms scattered around Cyprus, wastewater influent and tertiary-treated effluent, raw and finished surface water, and household potable water samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Most of the tested compounds were, minimum reporting limit, except for ibuprofen (mean of 1.4 ng L-1) and bisphenol A (mean of 50 ng L-1), which were detected in more than one out of the five groundwater sampling sites. Certain compounds were found in large concentrations in the wastewater influent (caffeine 82,000 ng L-1, sulfamethoxazole 240 ng L-1, ibuprofen 4,300 ng L-1, and triclosan 480 ng L-1). However, several pharmaceuticals and EDCs were detected in the tertiary-treated effluent (recycled water). For the raw and finished surface water, and potable water samples, ibuprofen was detected, whereas, bisphenol-A was measured in only potable water. Overall, with a few notable exceptions, source, finished and potable water had rare detection or low concentration of target compounds, but further research is needed to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the detected emerging contaminants along with the characterization of the related public health risk.

AB Wastewater treatment facilities use secondary treatment to stabilize the effect of discharged effluent on receiving waters by oxidizing biodegradable organic matter and reducing suspended solids and nutrients. The process was never specifically intended to remove trace quantities of xenobiotics, such as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Nevertheless, European studies performed at bench-scale or at small facilities have demonstrated that a critical minimum solids retention time (SRT) can achieve good reduction of many EDCs and pharmaceuticals. The objective of this study was to expand these findings to the removal performance for 20 PPCPs commonly found in the influent to full-scale facilities operating in the United States. The participating plants use SRT conditions ranging from 0.5 to 30 days and include facility capacities ranging from 19 000 m 3/d ( 5 mgd) to greater than 1 136 000 m(3)/d ( 300 mgd). Two pilot membrane bioreactors were also included in the study. The 20 PPCPs were categorized into nine bin combinations of occurrence frequency and treatment reduction performance. While most compounds were well removed, galaxolide ( a musk fragrance) occurred frequently and was resistant to removal. A minimum critical SRT, defined as the minimum SRT, needed to consistently demonstrate greater than 80% removal (SRT80), was compound-dependent, with most compounds removed at 5 to 15 days and a small group requiring longer SRTs. From limited data, no additional removal could be attributed to the use of membrane bioreactors, media filters, or longer hydraulic retention times. Reverse osmosis was effective in removing any remaining compounds.

AB The goal of this research was to study the operation of an integrated fixed-film activated sludge system (IFAS), in anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A2O) configuration for the elimination of emerging pollutants, in particular of 27 pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) (eight anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic pharmaceuticals (AIAPs), six antibiotics, four b-blockers, two antihypertensives/diuretics, three lipid regulators-bezafibrate and four psychiatric medications). Different operational conditions were analyzed in the biological reactor, controlling at all times both the amount of suspended and fixed biomass present. The A2O-IFAS system has obtained similar or higher removal efficiency (RE) in the elimination of organic matter, and especially of nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), with respect to the conventional A2O system, working however with very low values of the sludge retention time (SRT) (4.0 days) and mix liquid suspended solid (MLSS) in the reactor (1822 mg L-1). In general, conventional activated sludge (CAS) and IFAS processes show the importance of operating at high SRT and MLSS concentration, that give low food/microorganisms (F/M) ratio, to increase the RE of several PhACs. However, the A(2)O-IFAS system, operating with low mixed liquor SRT and MLSS has achieved similar or better RE of PhACs, obtaining the highest average REs values (>80%) for fenofibrate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, clarithromycin and atenolol. According to the results obtained, due to the affordable cost and well-demonstrated performance, IFAS systems become one of the most promising technology for conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) upgrading.

AB As environment emerging contaminants of anthropogenic origin, antidiabetic drugs are present in the range of high ng/L to ng/mL in the influent and the effluent of the waste water treatment plant (WWTP). The metformin compound is the most used hypoglycemic agent in the world. The aim of this study was to develop a new analytic method, based on solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detector (SPE-LC-MS/MS), for identification and quantification of 5 antidiabetic compounds (glibenclamide/glyburide, glimepiride, metformin, glipizide, guanyl urea, gliclazide) and one degradation product (guanyl urea). The investigated environmental samples were the influent and the effluent of four urbans WWTP's. By validating of the analytical method, it was obtained low LOQ's (0.2-4.5 ng/L), satisfactory recovery rates (53.6-116.8%), and corresponding performance parameters: inter-day precision (4.9-8.4%) and reproducibility (11.3-14.6%). The concentrations of antidiabetics were as follow in influent and effluent: metformin 76-2041ng/L and 2-206ng/L, gliclazide (14.1-42.4 ng/L, and 3.3-19.1), glipizide (7.5-11.2 ng/L and 6.5-10ng/L), guanyl urea (6.2-7.3 and 8.3-21.3 ng/L). The efficiency of elimination of the antidiabetics in WWTP's was maximum for metformin (67.6-98.5%), followed, by gliclazide (72.9-78.2%). The lowest elimination efficiency was calculated for glipizide (10.7-13.3%). The guanyl urea undergoes a formation process (74.5-84.2%) in effluent, from the metformin contained in influent.

AB Macro (BC), colloidal (CBC) and nanobiochar (NBC) were examined for the particle size effect for adsorptive removal of oxytetracycline (OTC) and co-occurring nutrients, which are present in synthetic hydrolyzed human urine. The surface morphologies and functionality of biochars were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy. Experiments for the removal of OTC were performed at the natural pH (pH 9.0) of hydrolyzed human urine using solid-solutions of 3 types of chars (1 g/L) with a contact time of 5 h, at initial OTC concentration of 50 mg/L where isotherm experiments were investigated with OTC concentrations from 25 to 1000 mg/L. The highest maximum adsorption capacity of 136.7 mg/g was reported for CBC, while BC reported slightly low value (129.34 mg/g). Interestingly, NBC demonstrated a two-step adsorption process with two adsorption capacities (16.9 and 113.2 mg/g). Colloidal biochar depicted the highest adsorption for NH4+, PO43-, and SO42- nutrients. All 3 types of chars showed strong retention with a poor desorption (6% in average) of OTC in synthetic hydrolyzed urine medium. CBC and NBC demonstrated both physisorption and chemisorption, whereas the OTC removal by BC was solely via physisorption. Nevertheless, CBC biochar demonstrated the best performance in adsorptive removal of OTC and nutrients in hydrolyzed human urine and its capability towards wastewater treatment. As the removal of nutrients were low, the treated urine can possibly be used as a safe fertilizer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dexamethasone (DEX) is a type of corticosteroid medication that is commonly used for the treatment of human and animal diseases. The presence of its residual in wastewater can cause human mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process (COP) in the presence of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles in DEX removal. This experimental study was conducted in a laboratory and batch scale. In this study, a batch reactor with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 45 m was used. The ozone concentration was determined using an iodometric method. The effects of some parameters such as solution pH, contact time, ozone concentration, and catalyst concentration on the process efficiency were investigated. Al2O3 nanoparticles were characterized by the scanning electron microscopy X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The DEX concentration was measured using an ultraviolet light spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 241 nm. According to the results, the optimal value of solution pH and catalyst dose in the COP was obtained to be 10 and 0.5 g/L, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the process efficiency was 100% in the presence of 10 mg/L of the initial pollutant concentration after 12 min, and magnesium oxide nanoparticles caused an increase in the removal efficiency (67%) compared to the single ozonation process without catalyst). Due to the lack of sludge production and accessibility, this process can be used as a useful approach for the removal of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Many organic compounds present at low concentrations in municipal wastewater, such as various pharmaceuticals and biocides, are recalcitrant in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To improve their biodegradation, oxidoreductase enzymes such as laccases were tested. The goal was to find optimal conditions for the transformation of two anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DFC) and mefenamic acid (MFA)), one biocide (triclosan (TCN)) and one plastic additive (bisphenol A (BPA)) by Trametes versicolor laccase. Experiments were conducted in spiked solutions at different pH values (from 3 to 9), enzyme concentrations (70-1400 U l(-1)), reaction times (0-26 hours) and temperatures (10, 25 and 40 degrees C) following a Doehlert experimental design. A semi-empirical model was developed to understand better the combined effects of the four factors and to determine optimal values. This model was able to fit well the experimental data (R-2 > 0.97) and showed good predictive ability. All four factors had a significant effect on the micropollutant oxidation with the greatest influence shown by pH. Results for single compounds were different from those obtained for mixtures of micropollutants. For instance, DFC transformation occurred at much higher rates in mixtures under alkaline conditions. Optimal conditions were compound-dependent, but were found to be between pH 4.5 to 6.5 and between 25 degrees C to more than 40 degrees C. A laccase concentration of 730 U l(-1) was sufficient to obtain a high removal rate (>90%) of the four individual compounds (range of times: 40 min to 5 hours), showing the potential of laccases to improve biodegradation of environmentally persistent compounds.

AB Phenolic compounds in wastewaters are difficult to treat using the conventional biological techniques such as activated sludge processes because of their bio-toxic and recalcitrant properties and the high volumes released from various chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. In the current work, a modified heterogeneous advanced Fenton process (AFP) is presented as a novel methodology for the treatment of phenolic wastewater. The modified AFP, which is a combination of hydrodynamic cavitation generated using a liquid whistle reactor and the AFP is a promising technology for wastewaters containing high organic content. The presence of hydrodynamic cavitation in the treatment scheme intensifies the Fenton process by generation of additional free radicals. Also, the turbulence produced during the hydrodynamic cavitation process increases the mass transfer rates as well as providing better contact between the pseudo-catalyst surfaces and the reactants.
   A multivariate design of experiments has been used to ascertain the influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage and iron catalyst loadings on the oxidation performance of the modified AFP. High er TOC removal rates were achieved with increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, the effect of catalyst loadings was less important on the TOC removal rate under conditions used in this work although there is an optimum value of this parameter. The concentration of iron species in the reaction solution was measured at 105 min and its relationship with the catalyst loadings and hydrogen peroxide level is presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although various single-concentration measurements of pharmaceuticals are available in the literature, detailed information on the variation over time of the concentration and the load in wastewater effluents and rivers and on the fate of these compounds in the aquatic environment are lacking. We measured the concentrations of six pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen, in the effluents of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in two rivers and in the water column of Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) over a time period of three months. In WWTP effluents, the concentrations reached 0.95 mug/L for carbamazepine, 0.06 mug/L for clofibric acid, 0.99 mug/L for diclofenac, 1.3 mug/L for ibuprofen, 0.18 mug/L for ketoprofen, and 2.6 mug/L for naproxen. The relative importance in terms of loads was carbamazepine, followed by diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and ketoprofen. An overall removal rate of all these pharmaceuticals was estimated in surface waters, under real-world conditions (in a lake), using field measurements and modeling. Carbamazepine and clofibric acid were fairly persistent. Phototransformation was identified as the main elimination process of diclofenac in the lake water during the study period. With a relatively high sorption coefficient to particles, ibuprofen might be eliminated by sedimentation. For ketoprofen and naproxen, biodegradation and phototransformation might be elimination processes. For the first time, quantitative data regarding removal rates were determined in surface waters under real-world conditions. All these findings are important data for a risk assessment of these compounds in surface waters.

AB The focusing on the discharge of nitrogen compounds to aquifers has put pressure on power plants to look into removal of nitrogen compounds from the gas scrubbing liquors (DESOX and DENOX). The scrubber liquor has a high salinity, a high chloride content and a temperature of about 40 degrees. Initial laboratory tests to evaluate the possibility of performing biological nitrification and denitrification showed promise and a pilot-scale test unit was established at one of the Danish coal-fired combined heat and power plant (AVEDORE 1).
   The pilot plant was operated under varying conditions with regard to temperature and chloride concentration. Maximum nitrification and denitrification rates were measured. At 30 degrees C and 20 g Cl-/l, maximum nitrification and denitrification rates of 2 and 3 mg N/g VSS.h respectively were measured. In the effluent, concentrations of inorganic nitrogen were below 8 mg N/I.
   Twice during the test period, inhibition of the biomass activity was caused by high concentrations of heavy metals. The high content of heavy metals was due to malfunction of pH control in the heavy metal removal plant. The nitrification process was more sensitive to heavy metals than the denitrification process, and during the two toxic events the nitrification rate decreased to zero.
   The influence of rapid changes in the chloride and nitrite contents on nitrification was also examined. The results from the performed tests can be applied on other wastewaters with similar characteristics as these scrubber liquors i.e. with salinity. As an example fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries can be mentioned. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The efficacy of a fluidized powdered activated carbon (PAC) pilot (CarboPlus (R)) was studied in both nominal (total nitrification + post denitrification) and degraded (partial nitrification + no denitrification) configuration of the Seine Centre WWTP (Colombes, France). In addition to conventional wastewater parameters 54 pharmaceuticals and hormones (PhPHs) and 59 other emerging pollutants were monitored in influents and effluents of the pilot. Thus, the impacts of the WWTP configuration, the process operation and the physico-chemical properties of the studied compounds were assessed in this article.
   Among the 26 PhPHs quantified in nominal WWTP configuration influents, 8 have high dissolved concentrations (>100 ng/L), 11 have an intermediary concentration (10-100 ng/L) and 7 are quantified below 10 nWL. Sulfamethoxazole is predominant (about 30% of the sum of the PhPHs). Overall, 6 PhPHs are poorly to moderately removed (<60%), such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or estrone, while 9 are very well removed (>80%), i.e. beta blockers, carbamazepine or trimethoprim, and 11 are well eliminated (60-80%), i.e. diclofenac, naproxen or sulfamethoxazole.
   In degraded WWTP configuration, higher levels of organic matter and higher concentrations of most pollutants are observed. Consequently, most PhPHs are substantially less removed in percentages but the removed flux is higher. Thus, the PAC dose required to achieve a given removal percentage is higher in degraded WWTP configuration. For the other micropollutants (34 quantified), artificial sweeteners and phthalates are found at particularly high concentrations in degraded WWTP configuration influents, up to mu g/L range. Only pesticides, bisphenol A and parabens are largely eliminated (50-95%), while perfluorinated acids, PAHs, triclosan and sweeteners are not or weakly removed (<50%). The remaining compounds exhibit a very variable fate from campaign to campaign.
   The fresh PAC dose was identified as the most influencing operation parameter and is strongly correlated to performances. Charge and hydrophobicity of compounds have been recognized as crucial for the micropollutant adsorption on PAC, as well as the molecular weight. Finally, a PAC dose of 10 mg/L allows an average removal of 72-80% of the sum of the PhPHs in nominal WWTP configuration. The comparaison of the results with those from the scarce other studies tends to indicate that an extrapolation of them to different PAC processes and to other WWTPs could be possible and relevant, taking into account the differences of water quality from WWTP to WWTP.

AB Conventional models for predicting the fate of xenobiotic organic trace chemicals, identified, and calibrated using data obtained in batch experiments spiked with reference substances, can be limited in predicting xenobiotic removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). At stake is the level of model complexity required to adequately describe a general theory of xenobiotic removal in WWTPs. In this article, we assess the factors that influence the removal of diclofenac and carbamazepine in activated sludge, and evaluate the complexity required for the model to effectively predict their removal. The results are generalized to previously published cases. Batch experimental results, obtained under anoxic and aerobic conditions, were used to identify extensions to, and to estimate parameter values of the activated sludge modeling framework for Xenobiotic trace chemicals (ASM-X). Measurement and simulation results obtained in the batch experiments, spiked with the diclofenac and carbamazepine content of preclarified municipal wastewater shows comparably high biotransformation rates in the presence of growth substrates. Forward dynamic simulations were performed using full-scale data obtained from Bekkelaget WWTP (Oslo, Norway) to evaluate the model and to estimate the level of re-transformable xenobiotics present in the influent. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that xenobiotic loading conditions can significantly influence the removal capacity of WWTPs. We show that the trace chemical retransformation in upstream sewer pipes can introduce considerable error in assessing the removal efficiency of a WWTP, based only on parent compound concentration measurements. The combination of our data with those from the literature shows that solids retention time (SRT) can enhance the biotransformation of diclofenac, which was not the case for carbamazepine. Model approximation of the xenobiotic concentration, detected in the solid phase, suggest that between approximately 1% and 16% of the total solid carbamazepine and diclofenac concentrations, respectively, is due to sorptionthe remainder being non-bioavailable and sequestered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model's predictive power over conventional tools in a statistical analysis, performed at four levels of structural complexity. To assess WWTP retrofitting needs to remove xenobiotic trace chemicals, we suggest using mechanistic models, e.g., ASM-X, in regional risk assessments. For preliminary evaluations, we present operating charts that can be used to estimate average xenobiotic removal rates in WWTPs as a function of SRT and the xenobiotics mass loads normalised to design treatment capacity.

AB Efficient visible light photocatalytic elimination of pharmaceutical factory wastewater is one of widely concerned and greatly significant attempts in dealing with increasingly serious environmental pollution problems. In this work, hybrid Ag/AgCl nanoparticles were successfully introduced into Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 mesocrystals via precipitation and photo-reduction methods for efficient visible light photocatalytic antibiotic elimination. Some characterization measurements, such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS spectra, fluorescence emission spectra, time-resolved fluorescence spectra, FT-IR spectra, and electrochemical measurements, were applied to investigate the physico-chemical properties of nanostructured Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals. The experiment results showed that nanostructured Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2-60 composites presented the best visible light photocatalytic performance for tetracycline degradation, which was approximately 3.52 times of Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals and 22.43 times of commercial TiO2. Trapping experiments of active species and DMPO spin-trapping ESR experiments further confirmed that the visible light photocatalytic tetracycline degradation by Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 mesocrystals were mainly due to the continuous attacks of photo-generated holes, (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(-) radicals on tetracycline molecules. Besides, nanostructured Ag/AgCl@Ti3TiO composites were also employed in visible light photocatalytic industrial para-ester wastewater degradation. Finally, possible tetracycline transformation pathways and visible light photocatalytic tetracycline degradation mechanism over plasmonic Ag/AgCl@Ti3+-TiO2 composites were also proposed. Current work indicates that defective semiconductor mesocrystals and their composites have huge prospects in the refractory organic elimination.

AB A multi-residue analysis method was developed for the determination of penicillins in wastewater of WWTP, surface water and groundwater in Spain. The procedure involves a solid phase extraction (SPE) and the subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-QqQ-MS/MS). The SPE processes were optimized by test of cartridges, sample pH and elution solvents. ENV+ cartridge was chosen for the extraction of penicillins from different environmental samples. The best conditions for the extraction efficiency of the targets were observed at sample pH 6, by eluting solvents of methanol and acetonitrile respectively. The method has been validated by calibration curve, corresponding regression coefficient, limit of quantification and recoveries. The results showed that the recoveries of more than 90 % were presented in all the compounds, except AMOX and AMPI, which had special amino-group in the molecular structure different with others. The matrix effect was also considered in the experiment and it was concluded that different matrix effect could be found between three kinds of waters, and the low retention of AMOX and AMPI on the cartridges was attributed to the matrices interference. The real sample detection showed that the penicillins degraded fast and only AMOX appeared in the studied environmental samples. The results of toxicology test on two compounds (AMOX and AMPI) showed that bacteria V. fischeri was proved to be relatively insensitive to both targets.

AB We have previously reported very high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluent from a treatment plant receiving wastewater from about 90 bulk drug manufacturers near Hyderabad, India. The main objective of the present study was to examine how high dilutions of this effluent affect mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 family genes and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in exposed wildlife, using the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. In gill filaments exposed to diluted effluent ex vivo, EROD activity was strongly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. In a subsequent in vivo study, groups of fish were exposed (24 h) to three concentrations of effluent, 0.8%, 1.6% or 3.2%. In this experiment, EROD in gills was induced 27-, 52- or 60-fold, respectively. Accordingly, CYP1A mRNA was markedly up-regulated in gill, liver and brain of fish exposed to all three effluent concentrations. Expression of mRNA for CYP1B1 and CYP1C1 was induced in gills at all concentrations while effects on these genes in liver and brain were weak or absent. The results of a time course study suggested that most CYP1-inducing substances in the effluent were readily metabolised or excreted, because the induced EROD activity and mRNA expression decreased when the fish were transferred to clean water. Considering that CYP1 enzymes play important roles in biotransformation of endogenous and foreign compounds, the observed dual effect of the effluent on CYP1 catalytic activity and mRNA expression suggests that multiple physiological functions could be affected in exposed wildlife.

AB Mobile and persistent chemicals that are present in urban wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals, may survive on-site or municipal wastewater treatment and post-discharge environmental processes. These pharmaceuticals have the potential to reach surface and groundwaters, essential drinking-water sources. A joint, two-phase U.S. Geological Survey-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study examined source and treated waters from 25 drinking-water treatment plants from across the United States. Treatment plants that had probable wastewater inputs to their source waters were selected to assess the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in such source waters, and to identify which pharmaceuticals persist through drinking-water treatment. All samples were analyzed for 24 pharmaceuticals
   in Phase I and for 118 in Phase II. In Phase I, 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of nine pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was five. Quantifiable pharmaceutical detections were fewer, with a maximum of five pharmaceuticals in any one sample and a median for all samples of two. In Phase II, 47 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of 41 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was eight. For 37 quantifiable pharmaceuticals in Phase II, median concentrations in source water were below 113 ng/L.
   For both Phase I and Phase II campaigns, substantially fewer pharmaceuticals were detected in treated water samples than in corresponding source-water samples. Seven different pharmaceuticals were detected in all Phase I treated water samples, with a maximum of four detections in any one sample and a median of two pharmaceuticals for all samples. In Phase II a total of 26 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all treated water samples, with a maximum of 20 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample and a median of 2 pharmaceuticals detected for all 25 samples. Source-water type influences the presence of pharmaceuticals in source and treated water. Treatment processes appear effective in reducing concentrations of most pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals more consistently persisting through treatment include carbamazepine, bupropion, cotinine, metoprolol, and lithium. Pharmaceutical concentrations and compositions from this study provide an important base data set for further sublethal, long-term exposure assessments, and for understanding potential effects of these and other contaminants of emerging concern upon human and ecosystem health.

AB Acetaminophen (APAP), a widely used analgesic-antipyretic drug, is frequently detected in the environment and may pose ecological risks to aquatic communities. In this work, an APAP-degrading organism, designated as Ensifer sp. POKHU, was isolated from activated sludge (AS) enriched with APAP. POKHU degraded up to 630 mg/L of APAP without substrate inhibition. The bacterium metabolized APAP to hydroquinone (HQ) via 4-aminophenol (4-AP). APAP derivatives, 4AP, HQ and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), frequently detected in the environment, were found to inhibit nitrogen metabolism (ammonium oxidation) to a greater extent than APAP. POKHU had the ability to degrade varying levels (0.4-40 mg/L) of 4-AP, HQ and BQ which indicated a great potential for detoxification in environments contaminated with both APAP and its derivatives. The addition of POKHU to fresh AS samples taken from a wastewater treatment plant greatly increased the biotransformation rates of APAP from 5.6 d(-1) (no POKHU augmentation) to >20.0 d(-1) (5% POKHU). Bioaugmentation with POKHU reduced 400 mu g/L of APAP to levels below its ecotoxicity threshold within 4 h, which is shorter than the typical hydraulic retention times for full-scale AS processing. Overall, this study identified a new auxiliary biological agent for APAP detoxification, which could degrade both APAP and its metabolic derivatives (those that can be more toxic than the parent contaminant, APAP). The results have practical implications for developing a biological means (detoxification and bioaugmentation) of treating high-strength pharmaceutical waste streams, such as wastewater from hospitals and drug manufactures, and of landfill leachates.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the influence of various concentrations of emerging pollutants (EPs) on growth, cell composition, and enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass. The microalgae used wereSpirulina platensisLEB-52,Chlorella homosphaera, andScenedesmus obliquus. The EPs used were paracetamol, diazepam, fluoxetine, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine, added to the cultures in concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mg L-1. The tests were carried out in closed 150-mL Erlenmeyer bioreactors, containing standard medium from each microalga culture. Cell concentrations were determined every 24 h using optical density. Culture continued for 20 days. At the end of the growth, biomass was collected and used to measure carbohydrates, proteins, and enzymatic hydrolysis, to determine possible changes due to the presence of EPs. In general, microalgae resisted concentrations of up to 100 mg L(-1)of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine, 30 mg L(-1)of diazepam, and 1 mg L(-1)of fluoxetine.S. obliquuswas the most resistant strain, followed byC. homosphaeraandS. platensisLEB-52 being less resistant. Acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine influenced the content of carbohydrates and proteins in biomass, reaching values above 35% of carbohydrates forS. platensisLEB-52 and above 66% of proteins forS. obliquus. There was no influence of EPs in the enzymatic hydrolysis processes. Microalgae showed resistance to EP concentrations, thereby emerging as a promising wastewater bioremediation technology. These high levels of carbohydrates are of great value because they can be used in the production of bioethanol.

AB Decomposition of the peroxydisulfate ion (S2O82-, PS) to sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) is a key step in sulfate radicalbased advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs). In this study, quantum chemical investigations and calculation of activation energy were performed to reveal the decomposition process of S2O82- at the atomic level. Furthermore, the impacts of several main co-existing components (CCs), including inorganic cations, inorganic anions and organic molecules in wastewater, on the activation energy were evaluated. The results revealed that 3 steps were involved in the S(2)O(8)(2-)decomposition: 1) the distance between two subgroups of the ground state of S2O82- (PSS0) increases from similar to 0.15 to similar to 0.215 nm driven by exogenous energy; 2) a transition occurs for S2O82- from PSS0 to the lowest triplet state (PST1); and 3) two subgroups of PST1 separate from each other spontaneously. The energy needed in the first step was demonstrated to be the activation energy. Moreover, two possible routes by which CCs affect the transition from PSS0 to PST1 were proposed. After ascertaining which route would be taken by different types of CCs, various methods of calculation were used to determine their impacts on S2O82- decomposition, i. e. promotion effect for H+, NH4+, Ca2+, Cl- and Br-, and inhibition effect for Na+, K+, Mg2+, NO3-, CO32-, SO42-, and all studied organic molecules, including acetic acid, benzene, bromoethane, 1-propanol and 4-chlorotoluene. The present study provided novel insights into the decomposition of S2O82- to SO4 center dot-, and emphasized the effects of main co-existing inorganic ions and organic molecules in wastewater on SR-AOPs.

AB Acetaminophen is the most widely used human medicine. Trace levels of acetaminophen are frequently detected in treated wastewater and the impacted surface or groundwater resources. However, even though soil is a primary receiving compartment, the fate of acetaminophen in soil is poorly known, including in particular the potential for the formation of incomplete degradation products that may have altered biological activity and mobility. In this study, using both C-14-labeling and LC-MS/MS techniques, we evaluated the dissipation routes and transformation pathways of acetaminophen in soils under a range of conditions. Throughout 120-d aerobic incubation, up to 17.0 +/- 0.8% of C-14-acetaminophen was mineralized, but mineralization was greatly inhibited after sterilization or amendment of biosolids. Immediately after treatment, the majority of C-14-residue became non-extractable or bound, with the level accounting for 73.4-93.3% of the applied amount at the end of incubation. A total of 8 intermediates were identified, including 3-hydroxyacetaminophen, hydroquinone, 1, 4-benzoquinone, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, p-acetanisidide, 4-methoxyphenol, 2-hexenoic acid, and 1, 4-dimethoxybenzene. Mineralization and rapid conversion to bound residues suggest that acetaminophen is quickly detoxified in soil, decreasing the potential for off-site transport such as leaching or runoff. On the other hand, the formation of a large number of degradation intermediates, and their potential biological activity, may pose unknown risks, such as accumulation into edible plants. This risk warrants further investigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants in the environment, which have drawn popular concerns recently. Most studies on the environmental fate of PPCPs have focused on their behaviors during wastewater treatment processes, in aquatic environments, and in the sludge, however, little is known about their behavior in agricultural soils. In this study, adsorption and degradation of six selected PPCPs, including clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, triclosan, diclofenac and bisphenol A have been investigated in the laboratory using four US agricultural soils associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse. Adsorption test using a batch equilibrium method demonstrated that adsorption of all tested chemicals in soils could be well described with Freundlich equation, and their adsorption affinity on soil followed the order of triclosan > bisphenol A > clofibric acid > naproxen > diclofenac > ibuprofen. Retardation factor (RF) suggested that ibuprofen had potential to move downward with percolating water, while triclosan and bisphenol A were readily retarded in soils. Degradation of selected PPCPs in soils generally followed first-order exponential decay kinetics, with half-lives ranging from 0.81 to 20.44 d. Degradation of PPCPs in soils appeared to be influenced by the soil organic matter and clay contents. Sterilization generally decreased the degradation rates, indicating microbial activity played a significant role in the degradation in soils. The degradation rate constant decreased with increasing initial chemical concentrations in soil, implying that the microbial activity was inhibited with high chemical loading levels.

AB In many coastal watersheds and ecosystems, rivers discharging to estuaries receive waters from domestic wastewater-treatment plants resulting in the release and distribution of pharmaceuticals to the marine environment. In the present study, 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients were measured regularly over 1 yr in the dissolved and particulate phases as they entered Narragansett Bay from the Pawtuxet River in Cranston (Rhode Island, USA). Of the active pharmaceutical ingredients measured, 14 were consistently present in the dissolved phase, with concentrations ranging from below detection to >310 ng/L, whereas 8 were present in the particulate phase (0.2-18 ng/g). Partition coefficients (K(d)s and K(OC)s) were determined, and organic carbon normalization reduced variability associated with Kds for the active pharmaceutical ingredients evaluated. Flux estimates based on river flow were calculated for both dissolved and particulate-phase active pharmaceutical ingredients, with particulate fluxes being low (1-12 g/yr) and dissolved fluxes of active pharmaceutical ingredients being 155 g/yr to 11 600 g/yr. Results indicate that the pharmaceuticals measured in the present study reside primarily in the dissolved phase and thus are likely bioavailable on entering the estuarine waters of Narragansett Bay. This long-term temporal study provides important information on seasonal and annual dynamics of pharmaceuticals in an urban estuarine watershed.

AB This work aims to synthesize a photocatalyst with high photocatalytic performances and explore the possibility of using it for antibiotic removal from wastewater. For that, the spinel ZnBi2O4 (ZBO) was produced with the co-precipitation method and its optical, dielectric, and electrochemical characteristics were studied. The phase has been determined and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For the ZBO morphology, a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been used. Then, the optical and dielectric properties of ZBO have been evaluated by calculating refractive index n (lambda), extinction coefficient (k), dissipation factor (tan delta), relaxation time (tau), and optical conductivity (sigma opt) using the spectral distribution of T(lambda) and R(lambda). An optical gap band of 2.8 eV was determined and confirmed. The electrochemical performance of ZBO was investigated and an n-type semiconductor with a flat band potential of 0.54 V_SCE was found. The photocatalytic efficiency of ZBO was investigated in order to degrade the antibiotic Cefixime (CFX) under different light source irradiations to exploit the optical properties. A high CFX degradation of approximately 89% was obtained under solar light (98 mW cm(-2)) only after 30 min, while 88% of CFX degradation efficiency has been reached after 2 h under UV irradiation (20 mW cm(-2)); this is in line with the finding of the optical characterizations. According to the obtained data, solar light assisted nanoparticle ZBO can be used successfully in wastewater to remove pharmaceutical products.

AB Calcium ion is an important cation influencing the binding of recalcitrant organic contaminants with activated sludge during wastewater treatment process, but there is still unknown about its role in amphoteric fluoroquinolones binding. Binding experiments show that Ca2+ markedly inhibited binding of ciprofloxacin (CIP) onto sludge, causing 7-203 times of CIP release. Multi-spectroscopic examinations indicate that tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like proteins in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were dominant components for CIP binding by static quenching and forming CIP-proteins complexes. Addition of Ca2+ into EPS and CIP binding systems induced increase of association constants (from 0.024-0.064 to 0.027-0.084 L/mu mol) and binding constants (from 0.002-0.039 to 0.012-0.107) and decrease of binding sites number (from 0.893-2.007 to 0.721-1.386). Functional groups of EPS and secondary structure of proteins were remarkably changed upon reactions with CIP and Ca2+. Calcium ion interacted with EPS and CIP binding system in two distinct ways: Ca2+ shielded Cdouble bondO in amide I in EPS for CIP binding, whereas strengthened binding between CIP and functional groups including Cdouble bondO in carboxyl groups in extra-microcolony polymers and Osingle bondH in extra-cellular polymers by forming ternary complexes. Cation competition for Cdouble bondO in amide I is responsible for Ca2+ induced CIP release from the sludge. Results suggest the highly potential release of CIP from high saline wastewater and cation-conditioned sludge which needs further monitoring and evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB BACKGROUND Sulfanilic acid (SA) is a highly typical representative sulfonated aromatic amine widely occurring in chemical and pharmaceutical wastewaters. Its release poses potential threats to the environment and human health. Thermally activated persulfate (TAP) is a promising technology for organic matter removal. In this study, TAP is evaluated using the oxidation of SA as a model reaction. RESULTS The oxidation performance of TAP on SA removal was investigated initially under different conditions of temperature, solution pH, persulfate dosage and initial SA concentration. Results showed that SA removal was effectively initiated by the TAP process and fitted well with a pseudo-first-order reaction model under all environmental conditions in water, and the yield of relatively low activation energy was 80.8 kJ mol(-1) under the optimum conditions. The solution pH exerted almost no influence on SA removal. Sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) were identified as major predominant free radicals by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and scavenger tests for removing SA during the TAP process. Non-target natural water constituents can affect the removal rate of SA, such as the chloride ion (Cl-) and the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) promote whereas humic acid (HA) reduces the removal. The total organic carbon (TOC) monitoring results indicated that SA was almost completely mineralized into CO2 and H2O during the 9 h reaction time. CONCLUSION Owing to the generation of highly reactive oxidizing species (SO4 center dot- and HO center dot), TAP oxidation as an environmentally friendly technology is a favorable option for SA-containing wastewater treatment usage.

AB Several micropollutants, including caffeine, artificial sweeteners, pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones and a current-use pesticide were analyzed in water samples collected from five groundwater pumping stations in Barbados. The presence of caffeine and three artificial sweeteners (i.e. acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin) in groundwater samples indicated that groundwater was being contaminated by infiltration of wastewater into the karst aquifer. An estrogen (i.e. estrone), three pharmaceuticals (i.e. carbamazepine, trimethoprim, ibuprofen) and a transformation product of the fungicide, chlorothalonil (i.e. 4-hydroxychlorothalonil) were also detected at ng/L concentrations in groundwater collected from two or more pumping sites. The concentrations of carbamazepine and trimethoprim were correlated with the concentrations of caffeine (R-2 values of 0.70 to 0.80), indicating pharmaceutical contamination of groundwater by infiltration from domestic wastewater. The concentrations of caffeine were generally higher in groundwater samples collected in June during the wet season relative to the concentrations in samples collected in February during the dry season, indicating that infiltration of contaminants is higher during periods of heavy rainfall. Rapid rates of degradation and relatively slow rates of infiltration may explain why several target analytes were not detected in groundwater. Elevated concentrations of 4-hydroxychlorothalonil > 0.1 mu g/L in samples collected at two of the monitoring sites warrant further studies on the sources and the distribution of this compound and other pesticides used in agriculture and for turf-treatment (e.g. golf courses). Overall, more data are needed in order to implement mitigation strategies that are effective in reducing chemical contamination in groundwater in Barbados. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The release of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems from the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) is of great concern due to possible chronic toxic effects as well as contribution to antibiotic resistance spread. In the present work, the degradation of the antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) by ultraviolet (UV)/peracetic acid (PM) (an advanced oxidation process that has been poorly investigated so far) and UV/H2O2 processes as well as its transformation products were studied under different light sources. UV-C/PAA process was found to be effective in the degradation of CAP (half life time (t(1/n)) = 20 min, initial CAP concentration 25 mg/L), but not effective when solar radiation was used as light source. It is worthy to note that the presence of H2O2 in the commercial PAA solution significantly affected the removal efficiency of CAP by UV-C/PAA process. When H2O2 was quenched by catalase addition, t(1/2) increased to 99 min, meaning that PM can still produce hydroxyl radicals but at a lower rate compared to H2O2. Moreover, process efficiency further decreased in the presence of both solar simulated and natural solar irradiation, being CAP removal also the result of thermal decomposition. The transformation products detected during CAP degradation by UV-C/PAA were different respect to those produced during UV-C/H2O2 process.

AB Re-thinking our approach to dealing with waste is one of the major challenges in achieving a more sustainable society. However, it could also generate numerous opportunities. Specifically, in the context of wastewater, nutrients, energy and water could be mined from it. Because of its exceptionally high nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentration, human urine is particularly suitable to be processed for fertiliser production. In the present study, forward osmosis (FO) was employed to mine the P and N from human urine. Two Mg2+-fertilisers, i.e. MgSO4 and Mg(NO3)(2) were selected as draw solution (DS) to dewater synthetic non-hydrolysed urine. In this process, the Mg2+ reverse salt flux (RSF) were used to recover P as struvite. Simultaneously, the urea was recovered in the DS as it is poorly rejected by the FO membrane. The results showed that, after concentrating the urine by 60%, about 40% of the P and 50% of the N were recovered. XRD and SEM EDX analysis confirmed that P was precipitated as mineral struvite. If successfully tested on real urine, this process could be applied to treat the urine collected in urban areas e.g., high-rise building. After the filtration, the solid struvite could be sold for inland applications whereas the diluted fertiliser used for direct fertigation of green walls, parks or for urban farming. Finally, reduction in the load of N, P to the downstream wastewater treatment plant would also ensure a more sustainable urban water cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The attenuation of bulk organic matter and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) was evaluated for various aquifer recharge and recovery (ARR)-ozone (O-3) hybrid treatment process combinations using soil-batch reactor and bench-scale ozonation experiments as a proof of concept prior to pilot and/or field studies. In water reclamation and especially potable reuse, refractory bulk organic matter and TOrCs are of potential health concern in recycled waters. In this study, the role of biotransformation of bulk organic matter and TOrCs was investigated considering different simulated treatment combinations, including soil passage (ARR) alone, ARR after ozonation (O-3-ARR), and ARR prior to ozonation (ARR-O-3). During oxic (aerobic) ARR simulations, soluble microbial-like substances (e.g., higher molecular weight polysaccharides and proteins) were easily removed while (lower molecular weight) humic substances and aromatic organic matter were not efficiently removed. During ARR-ozone treatment simulations, removals of bulk organic matter and TOrCs were rapid and effective compared to ARR alone. A higher reduction of effluent-derived organic matter, including aromatic organic matter and humic substances, was observed in the ARR-O-3 hybrid followed by the O-3-ARR hybrid. An enhanced attenuation of recalcitrant TOrCs was observed while increasing the ozone dose slightly (O-3: DOC = 1). TOrC removal efficiency also increased during the postozone treatment combination (i.e., ARR-O-3). In addition, the carcinogenic wastewater disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was eliminated below the method reporting limit (<5 ngl(-1)) both during ARR treatment alone and the ARR-ozone hybrid.

AB Extensive use of pharmaceuticals and growth hormone in farm animal and live stocks has resulted in their frequent detection in soils, groundwater, and wastewater. The fate and transport of these compounds are strongly affected by their sorptive behavior to the soil minerals and humic materials. In this research, we conducted the sorption of tetracycline (TC), a common antibiotic, on palygorskite (PFL-1), a fibrous clay mineral of high surface area and high sorptivity towards organic compounds. The results showed that the sorption capacity of TC on PFL-1 was as high as 210 mmol/kg at pH 8.7. The sorption was relatively fast and reached equilibrium in 2 h. Solution pH and ionic strength had significant effects on TC sorption. The sorption of TC by palygorskite is endothermic and the free energy of sorption is in the range of -10 to -30 kJ/mol, suggesting a strong physical sorption. The X-ray diffraction patterns before and after TC sorption revealed no changes in d-spacing and intensity under different pH and initial TC concentrations, indicating that the sorbed TC molecules are on the external surface of the mineral in contrast to intercalation of TC into swelling clays, such as montmorillonite. The small positive value of entropy change suggested that TC molecules are in disordered arrangement on palygorskite surfaces. Surface sorption of TC on PFL-1 is further supported by the derivative of gravimetric analysis and by the calculation of the amount of TC sorption normalized to the surface area. The results suggest that palygorskite Could be a good candidate to remove TC from wastewater containing higher amounts of TC. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amendment of soil with organic urban and animal wastes can keep arable soil fertile without the need for synthetic fertilizers. However, pollutants present in these types of waste might be carried into the soil with unintended consequences for the environment. We studied an experimental agricultural plot, which had been amended with either synthetic inorganic fertilizers, human urine, manure, or wastewater treatment sludge at very high rates. We applied chemical non-target analysis to characterize present organic micropollutants, intending to compare treatments and highlight suspects of environmental concern. Soil samples were prepared by pressurized liquid and purified with solid-phase extraction before analysis with nanoflow ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry. Automated elucidation with two mass spectral libraries, multiple large chemical databases and environmental NORMAN suspect lists was able to annotate (level 3 and level 2) similar to 20% of the 2306 detected features. A following principal component- and differential-analysis could separate the soil treatment groups' pollution profiles and highlight high relative abundance features. From cattle manure, natural compounds such as bile acids and steroids were found. Human urine led to pollution with common pharmaceuticals such as metoprolol and propranolol. The highest number was added by wastewater treatment sludge, with 25 significant contaminants, spanning blood pressure regulators, antidepressants, synthetic steroids and sleep medication. Furthermore, using Kendrick mass defect plots, a series of polypropylene glycols could be revealed in the soil. Non-target analysis appears to be a promising method to characterize organic pollutants in soils. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many micropollutants (MPs) that may adversely affect aquatic life when released into the environment are common in modern societies. The presence of MPs in the environment is frequently connected to release from wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, advanced treatments are needed to remove these MPs. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) efficiently removes MPs in both laboratory experiments and full-scale applications. However, its single-use nature and the difficulty of handling spent PAC have limited the popularity of this approach. Therefore, various methods for PAC regeneration have been investigated. The current study compares two methods for regenerating spent PAC saturated with MPs: ozonation and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process. Six MPs were tested: benzotriazole, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and trimethoprim. Both methods achieved regeneration efficiencies (REs) of >100% for four of the MPs. However, the REs for diclofenac (95?102%) and PFOA (67?69%) were below 100%. Surface characterization showed that PAC regeneration did not restore the micro-and mesopores that are mainly responsible for MPs sorption by virgin PAC. Instead, MPs sorption onto regenerated PAC was determined to be related to different interactions between PAC surface and MPs' ionic states including electrostatic, H-bonding, and electron donor-acceptor interactions. Transformation products of adsorbed MPs typically remained sorbed on the regenerated PAC rather than being transferred to the regeneration effluent. ? 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This work proposes the evaluation of an aluminized surface on the bottom of open reactors to perform a photo-Fenton process, at circumneutral pH(using Fe III-Ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid complex), for elimination of micropollutants (MPs) in real effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (EMWWTP). Firstly, the strategy was to initially investigate the real EMWWTP spiked with several MPs (acetaminophen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, caffeine, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) with 20 and 100 mu g L-1 in a laboratory scale (evaluated by HPLC-UV) using a solar simulator. Finally, the removal of all MCs present in the real EMWWTP was monitored (evaluated by HPLC-MS) in a pilot-scale (90 L) in a raceway pond reactor (RPR). The treatment time required for degradation above 80% for the investigated MPs was over 30 min, and the predominant effect could be mainly associated with organics present in the real EMWWTP due to the light attenuation and scavenging of radical species. Moreover, the results confirmed that chloride and sulfate would most likely equally not affect the process. The use of an aluminized surface on the bottom of RPRs has been confirmed as a suitable option to improve the photo-Fenton reaction, enabling the use of lower doses of iron. Up to 60 different MPs found in EMWWTP have been successfully degraded using 0.1 mM of Fe at circumneutral pH with a consumption of 30 mg L-1 H2O2 with less than 45 min. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The availability of suitable support material for immobilizing photocatalyst, without loss of photoactivity, is a bottleneck for photocatalytic wastewater treatment in real-world applications. Here we report a facile method for the preparation and pore structure modification of highly stable and porous polymer composite consisting of polysulfone (PSF) and alginate (Alg) for immobilizing TiO2 nanoparticles. Compared to its constituents alone, this newly identified polymer composite has much higher stability as well as adsorption capacity towards the pollutant molecules, acting as an ideal matrix for immobilizing the photocatalyst. Various combinations of PSF, Alg, and TiO2 were tested in the form of beads, with the final ratio of 10:6:12, for the best adsorption and photodegradation capacity. With surface modification, these beads (denoted as PAT-12 M) showed superior photocatalytic activity toward methylene blue (MB) and the two pharmaceuticals - triclosan (TCS) and diclofenac (DCF), which were almost completely removed within 50, 40 and 120 min, respectively. The reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments confirmed the center dot OH radicals played the primary role in photodegradation. The robustness of these beads allowed their use for at least 25 cycles under batch mode and 30 days in continuous mode with over 99% MB degradation. Thanks to the large size (3 mm) and excellent mechanical stability, these beads can be effortlessly dispersed in polluted solutions, in interswitchable suspended or floating form, and easily recovered. With these advantageous properties, PAT-12 M beads could be effectively employed for a wide range of applications at large scales.

AB The article presents results regarding the ibuprofen reduction rate at three various temperature values (8, 18 and 28 degrees C) which were conducted using a static test in accordance with the PN-C-04645 'Water and wastewater. Evaluation of partial biodegradation of anionic and non-ionic surface active substances. Initial test' standard. A single study cycle including the analysis of ibuprofen degradation rate in specific temperature variants lasted 24 h. The activated sludge for tests was obtained from the aeration zone of a bioreactor localized in the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant in Poznan City (Poland), which was used for inoculation (1 g/dm(3)) of sterile samples with the medium and ibuprofen (10 mg/dm(3)) after appropriate pre-treatment (intense aeration for 5 h). The analysis procedure included the separation and concentration of analytes from biodegradation samples by means of solid phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent determination with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC liquid chromatogram (Dionex, USA) with a tandem API 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Biosystem, MDS Sciex, USA). Both literature review as well as the conducted initial studies confirmed that the removal of ibuprofen proceeds more rapidly at higher temperature values. A higher retention rate also enhanced the reduction of ibuprofen concentration. A decrease of its concentration was observed after 24 h, which reached 40 and 50 % for temperature values of 8 and 18 degrees C, accordingly, whereas the highest reduction by approx. 65 % was noted at 28 degrees C.

AB High concentrations of antibiotic compounds within pharmaceutical wastewater have hazardous impacts toward environment and human health. Therefore, there is an immediate requirement of efficient treatment method for removal of antibiotics from aquatic environment. In the present study, the cryptomelane catalyst-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (K-OMS-2) was synthesized in the presence of benzyl alcohol as a reducing agent and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a structure-directing agent and then utilized to reduce the metronidazole. The central composite design method was the experimental design adopted. The FESEM analysis revealed that the K-OMS-2 surface contained many uniformly cylindrical aggregates less than about 40nm in diameter and about 80-100nm in length. Besides, a high specific surface area of 129m(2)/g and average pore size of 45.47nm were recorded. According to the TGA/DTA analysis, the prepared catalyst revealed high thermal stability. The maximum metronidazole degradation (95.36%) was evident at conditions of pH = 3, catalyst mass = 0.97g/L, contact time = 200min, and metronidazole concentration = 20mg/L. Metronidazole did not form a complex with nitrate, fluoride, sulfate, or hardness. These ions exerted a negligible effect on metronidazole reduction using the K-OMS-2 catalyst, except for hardness, which reduced the removal efficiency of metronidazole by 17%. The FTIR and LC-MS revealed a complex mechanism involved in the metronidazole degradation by the K-OMS-2 involving the formation of an amino group, a hydroxyelated compound via N-denitration, and hydrogenation process on the K-OMS-2 catalyst surface.

AB A coagulation-flotation method using an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH], was designed for rapid removal of tetracycline antibiotics from water. The method was conducted by adding electrically equivalent amounts of SDS and PAH followed by feeding air bubbles. The air bubbles vigorously mixed water and induced the coagulation of SDS-PAH complex to from agglutinative coagulum on water surfaces. In the presence of Al(III) ions, tetracycline in water was collected to the coagulum as an hydrophobic ion-pair of the Al(III)-chelate with a dodecyl sulfate ion (m/z = 736). Fluorometric study using a molecular probe, N-phenyl-1naphthylamine, suggested the formation of hydrophobic region in SDS-PAH complex as well as air/water interfaces for the sorption of the hydrophobic ion-pair. Combined use of 20 mg L-1 SDS, 6.5 mg L-1 PAH, and 1 mg L-1 Al(III) ions allowed nearly complete ( > 99%) removal of tetracycline from water within 5 min. SDS concentration remaining in the treated water was 0.12 0.05 mg L-1, being lower than Japanese water regulation (0.2 mg L-1) of total anionic surfactants. Other tetracyclines and fluoroquinolone antibiotics as well as different acidic and basic pharmaceuticals were nearly completely (>96%) removed from water. Applicability to wastewater treatment was examined by using secondary effluents and synthesized hospital wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption of weakly basic compounds by sludge is poorly understood, although it has important implications on the distribution and fate of such micropollutants in wastewater effluent and sludge. Additionally, many of these compounds are chiral, and it is likely that their interactions with sludge is stereoselective and that the process may be further modified by surfactants that coexist in these systems. Adsorption of (R) and (S)-enantiomers of five commonly used beta-blockers, i.e., acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol, on sludge was characterized through batch experiments. Stereo selectivity in adsorption increased with decreases in hydrophobicity of the beta-blockers. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of the amount of acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol sorbed on sludge were 0.27, 0.55 and 032, respectively. Thus, K-d values of the (S)-enantiomers of acebutolol and metoprolol were approximately twice that of the (R)-enantiomer, that is, 109 +/- 11 and 57 +/- 8 L/kg compared to 52 +/- 13 and 22 +/- 8 L/kg, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in K-d values of the enantiomers of pindolol and propranolol, suggesting stereoselectivity in adsorption was likely driven by specific polar interactions rather than hydrophobic interactions. The EF value of atenolol decreased from 0.55 +/- 0.03 to 0.44 +/- 0.04 after modifying the sludge with Triton X 100. These results suggested that surfactants altered adsorption of beta-blockers to sludge, likely by forming ion pair complexes that promote hydrophobic interactions with the solid surfaces.

AB The ability of tropical horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) planted with Typha angustifolia to remove four widely used pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, declofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) at the relatively short hydraulic residence time of 2-4 days was documented. For both ibuprofen and naproxen, pharmaceutical compounds with low D-ow values, the planted beds showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of removal efficiencies (80% and 91%, respectively, at the 4 day HRT), compared to unplanted beds (60% and 52%, respectively). The presence of plants resulted in the removal of these pharmaceutical compounds from artificial wastewater. The more oxidizing environment in the rhizosphere might have played an important role, but other rhizosphere effects, beside rhizosphere aeration, appeared to be important also. Carbamazepine, considered one of the most recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, and declofenac showed low removal efficiencies in our CW, and this is attributable to their higher hydrophobicity. The fact that the removal of these compounds could be explained by the sorption onto the available organic surfaces, explains why there was no significant difference (p > 0.05)in their removal efficiencies between planted as compared to unplanted beds. No statistical significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for the removal efficiencies of any of the pharmaceuticals tested for the 2-day HRT as compared to that corresponding to 4-day HRT. The rather efficient removal shown by the wetlands in this study (with HRTs of 2-4 days), indicates that such a CW system may be more practically used (with less land requirements) in tropical regions for removing conventional pollutants and certain pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater effluents.

AB The present investigation was aimed at determining the impact of the macrolide antibiotic Tylosin in reduced HRT at constant organic loading rate (OLR) by varying feed substrate concentration in an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR). The antibiotic concentration was maintained at 200 mg.L-1, at constant OLR of. 1.88 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1), by varying feed substrate concentration to the UASR and the HRT was decreased gradually from 4 to 1 d. Throughout the operation period, brewery wastewater was used as simple feed substrate to elevate the concentration of easily biodegradable carbon in comparison with the concentrations of more recalcitrant Tylosin substrate. The reactor alkalinity was controlled in all the stages of UASR by adding 1000 2000 mg.L-1 CaCO3. Results showed the total COD removal efficiency at 4 d HRT was around 92%, after which point there was a slight decrease at 3 and 2 d HRT (average 82%), and this was reduced further (average 77%) at a HRT of 1 d. The UASR showed stable operation with effluent volatile fatty acid (VFA) less than 300 mg.L-1 throughout the experimental period (HRT 4 - 1 d). Moreover, the average methane yield (CH4.kg COW) showed a relatively constant profile and was largely unaffected by HRT in all the stages of UASR. These results show that bacteria were readily adapted to wastewater containing Tylosin at lower HRTs and did not affect the reactor performance substantially.

AB A high-throughput, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method has been developed for the determination of 51 emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) in environmental waters. The method was validated for the analysis of 38 pharmaceutically active, 10 endocrine disrupting, and three perfluoroalkylated compounds. Method performance parameters, including sample preservatives, pH values used in the solid-phase extraction (SPE), sample storage, sample extract storage time, and matrix effects were discussed in detail for different aquatic matrices, including drinking water, wastewater,and surface water. Isotope-labeled compounds were used as injection internal standards (IIS) or isotope dilution quantitation standards (VIS) to improve the data quality, investigate the behavior of matrix effects during SPE sample preparation and LC/MS-MS analysis, and to validate isotope dilution mass spectrometric (IDMS) determination of selected compounds. Method detection limits were determined to be in the low ng/L range for the compounds evaluated. By application of this method to the analysis of effluents and samples downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, more than 35 target EOPs were quantified. We demonstrated method ruggedness by quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) data, showed that matrix effects were dependent on modes of electrospray ionization, and could not be removed via SPE or cleanup procedures, exerting the same effect to target compounds in both raw and extracted samples. Both C-13- and H-2-labeled IDQS could be added to samples before sample extraction, and, their recoveries used to correct matrix effects in LC/MS-MS EOP analyses.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attractive adsorbents for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. However, in their powder form, the adsorbents suffer from the disadvantage of poor recyclability and complex operational process. Herein, we incorporated typical MOFs (ZIF-8, ZIF-67, HKUST-1, and Fe-BTC) into low-cost chitosan matrix for the tetracycline removal. Metal hydroxide(or metal oxide)/chitosan composite beads from the metal salt/chitosan solution were used as MOF precursor, which lead to the uniform and stable MOF loading into chitosan. This composition could not only shape MOFs into beads but also improve the adsorption capacity of the chitosan. As a result, ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads exhibited good adsorption performance toward antibiotic tetracycline. The adsorption processes followed pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity could reach 495.04 mg/g, which is higher than most of the MOF-based or natural polymer-based tetracycline adsorbents. Moreover, the removal efficiency of ZIF-8-chitosan composite beads toward tetracycline was still above 90% after ten adsorption-desorption cycles. In the fixed-bed experiment, ZIF-8-chitosan column could treat similar to 887 bed volumes (BV) of tetracycline solution in real water sample. Both experimental characterizations and DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption mechanism involves in the electrostatic interaction, pi-pi stacking interaction and hydrogen-bonding interaction. This study provides a promising strategy for uniform MOF loading into the matrix and potential adsorbents for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is well known as agricultural wastewater that has a high potential as a medium for microalgal growth due to its high macro- and micronutrient content. The cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis is considered as a species with a high C-phycocyanin (C-PC) content which is important for fine chemical and pharmaceutical applications. However, cultivation of A. platensis on POME to produce economically feasible amounts of C-PC has not been well explored. For this, environmental, nutritional, and cultivation modes (batch, semi-continuous) were varied to optimize C-PC productivity when cultivated at various POME concentrations. Arthrospira platensis was found to grow well on POME. Highest biomass and C-PC concentrations were found on 30-100% POME. Central composite rotatable design (CCRD) response surface methodology demonstrated that C-PC productivity was influenced by urea addition at the optimum salinity. The highest C-PC productivity was found on 100% POME during semi-continuous cultivation, while the addition of phosphorus and urea did not significantly improve C-PC productivity. By applying semi-continuous cultivation with 50% POME at the first stage and 100% POME at the second stage, a similarly high C-PC productivity (4.08 +/- 1.3 mg L-1 day(-1)) was achieved as compared with (artificial) Zarrouk medium during batch cultivation. We conclude that, when using a two-stage semi-continuous cultivation process, A. platensis can produce economically feasible amounts of C-PC when cultivated on 100% POME.

AB Ozonation, solar photocatalytic oxidation and a combination of both systems (i.e., solar photocatalytic ozonation) have been studied to treat a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant containing a selection of six emerging contaminants (acetaminophen, antipyrine, bisphenol A, caffeine, metoprolol and testosterone). Fe(III), Fenton reagent and TiO2 were used in photocatalytic experiments, which were conducted in a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector photo-reactor using solar radiation as energy source. Emerging contaminants (0.2 mg L-1 each), at pH 3, were completely removed by photo-Fenton and single ozonation in 90 and 25 min, respectively. Moreover, solar photocatalytic ozonation treatments (Fe(III)/O-3/light and Fe(III)/H2O2/O-3/light systems) were able to completely remove the ECs in about 20 min with UV doses of 2-6 kJ L-1. However, the organic matter mineralization level achieved was limited (<35% TOC removal) even after the application of solar photocatalytic ozonation, for which an enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals was measured in experiments carried out in the presence of the hydroxyl radical probe p-chlorobenzoic acid. Daphnia magna bioassays were used to test toxicity of samples before and after their treatment, showing that samples subjected to solar photocatalytic ozonation were less toxic (% inhibition <15%) than the mixture of emerging contaminants in the secondary effluent (% inhibition about 25%). Finally, a simplified estimation of operating costs shows some solar photocatalytic ozonation processes advantageous over the solar photo-Fenton system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, there is an emergence of endocrine-disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (EDC/PPCPs) as important pollutants to remove from drinking water and reclaimed wastewater. In this work, the efficiency of removing pharmaceuticals (PCs) from model aqueous solutions and raw wastewater with ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), activated carbon adsorption (AC), biological methods (SBR) and oxidation with ClO2 was investigated. Some treatments have also been used as combined processes: UF + NF, UF +AC, SBR + ClO2. Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam were selected as model compounds. In order to evaluate their removal, PC solutions were also considered at several operating conditions (pH, conductivity, concentration, and temperature), and optimal conditions were obtained. Experiments were performed at usual PC concentrations in wastewaters: 1000 ng/L for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, 300 ng/L for Diclofenac, Sulfamethoxazole, Clonazepam, and Diazepam. Separation was evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Results indicated that the removal efficiency depends on their Log K-ow, which is intrinsically related to their hydrophobicity and then, to their adsorption onto the surface (UF, NF, and AC). Also, NF, AC, and combined processes (UF + NF, UF +AC) were the most suitable separation techniques to obtain high removal efficiencies for most of the PCs used, except for Acetaminophen (which showed great removal efficacy using SBR). UF presented low removal yields for all PCs tested. ClO2 treatment was more effective at high concentration (50 mg ClO2/L). Furthermore, results also showed that there are significant differences on the performance of the processes applied and which treatment is the most effective for each PC analyzed.

AB Urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluents are among the possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) spread into the environment. In this work, the effect of UV radiation on antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains was compared with that of chlorination process. Under the investigated conditions, UV disinfection process resulted in a total inactivation after 60 min of irradiation (1.25 x 10(4) mu W s cm(-2)) compared to 120 min chlorine contact time (initial chlorine dose of 2 mg L-1). Moreover, no change in E. coli strains' resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) (minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) > 256 mg L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (MIC > 1024 mg L-1) could be observed after UV treatment, while the treatment affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to ciprofloxacin (CPX) (MIC decreased by 33% and 50% after 60 and 120 min, respectively). Contrarily, chlorination process did not affect antibiotic resistance of the investigated E. coli strains. Finally, the effect of UV radiation on the mixture of three antibiotics was also investigated and photodegradation data fit quite well pseudo first order kinetic models with rip values of 14, 20 and 25 min for CPX, AMX and SMZ, respectively. According to these results, conventional disinfection processes may not be effective in the inactivation of ARB, and the simultaneous release of ARB and antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations into UWWTP effluent may promote the development of resistance among bacteria in receiving water.

AB Substituted diphenylamine antioxidants (SDPAs) are additives used in various commodities and are commonly found in environmental samples. However, limited information was available on their fate and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This paper reports the results on the occurrence and removal efficiency of ten selected SDPAs in six WWTPs equipped with different treatment processes in Northeast China. Quite similar distributions of different SDPA congeners were shown in the studied WWTPs, with ditertoctyl-diphenylamine (C8/C8-DPA), tertbutyl-tertoctyl-diphenylamine (C4/C8-DPA), and tertoctyl-diphenylamine (C8-DPA) being always dominant in the influent, effluent, and sludge (total > 80%). A cyclic activated sludge system combined with a V-shape filter achieved the highest removal efficiencies of SDPAs among various treatment processes. Styrenated-diphenylamine1 (S-DPA1) (96 +/- 10%), C8-DPA (95 +/- 5.5%), and distyrenated-diphenylamine1 (DSDPA1) (94 +/- 9.3%) showed high and stable removal efficiencies, whereas C4/C8-DPA (85 +/- 31%) and C8/C8DPA (84 +/- 62%) showed considerably varied removal efficiencies. Per-day discharges of SDPAs to the receiving environment through effluent and sludge were estimated as 828 +/- 350 and 5578 +/- 5196 mg, respectively. A median of 85% of the initial mass loadings of SDPAs was found in the sludge samples, suggesting that the observed removal of SDPAs in the WWTPs was caused by their sorption to the sludge, rather than biodegradation/transformation. This work provides an overall description of the occurrence, fate, and mass balance of SDPAs in WWTPs in Northeast China and highlights a new emission route to the environment via WWTPs.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) do not have standard regulations for discharge in the environment and are categorized as contaminants of emerging concern as they pose potential threats to ecology as well as humans even at low concentrations. Conventional treatment processes generally employed in the wastewater treatment plants are not adequately engineered for effective removal of PPCPs. Identifying cost-effective tertiary treatment is therefore, important for complete removal of PPCPs from wastewater prior to discharge or reuse. Present study demonstrates adsorption using granular-activated carbon (GAC) as a possible tertiary treatment for simultaneous removal of five PPCPs from aqueous media. Adsorbent was characterized in terms of morphology, surface area, surface charge distribution, and presence of functional groups. Performance of GAC was investigated for sorption of three hydrophilic (ciprofloxacin, acetaminophen, and caffeine) and two hydrophobic (benzophenone and irgasan) PPCPs from aqueous solution varying the process parameters (initial concentration, adsorbent dose, pH, agitation time). Langmuir isotherm model (correlation coefficients (R-2): 0.993 to 0.998) appeared to fit the isotherm data better than Temkin isotherm model for these adsorbates. Adsorption efficiencies of these compounds (8.26 to 20.40 mg g(-1)) were in accordance with their log K-ow values. While the adsorption kinetics was best explained in terms of a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, the data suggested that adsorption mechanism was mainly governed by the intraparticle diffusion. The role of physical factors like molecular volume, molecular size, and area of targeted PPCPs were investigated through computational studies which in turn can help predicting their uptake onto GAC.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceutical products and pesticides are still present in treated wastewater. Several of these compounds are photoactive, either by direct or indirect photodegradation. An innovative on-site experimental protocol was designed to investigate the contribution of photodegradation processes to eliminate micropolluants in constructed wetland (CW). The solar photodegradation of 23 organic micropollutants was studied using in situ photoreactors at different depths. A CW-photodegradation model was designed and calibrated to further scrutinize the contribution of direct and indirect photodegradation processes in the elimination of micropollutants.
   The results show that photodegradation is most effective in the first 10 cm of the water column. A classification of micropollutants in 3 groups was developed to characterize their photodegradation. A significant increase of the half-life by direct photodegradation was observed in winter compared to summer due to a lower light intensity in winter. On the opposite, for direct + indirect photodegradation, no significant difference was observed between seasons. The decrease in light intensity in winter was compensated by higher nitrates concentration which promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals and increased indirect photodegradation.
   The CW-photodegradation model successfully simulated the measured concentrations for direct and indirect photodegradation for 23 micropolluants. Nonetheless, it overestimated the indirect photo degradation with hydroxyl radicals when using default parameter values derived for surface waters. Hence, the consumption of hydroxyl radicals was increased by a factor of 20 for treated water. This model highlighted the predominance of direct photodegradation in the elimination of all micropollutants, except sotalol for the winter campaign. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metoprolol (MPL) is a chiral beta-blocker ubiquitously detected in various environments due to its low to moderate removal in wastewater treatment plants. This study was conducted to test the potential of using microalgae to degrade emerging contaminant MPL and to characterize the enantiomeric enrichment during MPL degradation by microalgae. The results showed that PO43--P, NO3--N and MPL could be simultaneously removed in the synthetic effluent by the targeted microalgae species, indicating microalgae were promising in wastewater treatment. Stereoselectivity was observed during MPL degradation by microalgae, with R-form enrichment. A marginal linear relationship between MPL degradation and enantiomeric enrichment was observed, implying that the enantiomeric tool, used as a quantitative indicator of biodegradation, could possibly be applied in MPL degradation by microalgae. An efficient liquid chromatograph tandem high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) chiral analytical method was developed to identify transformation products (TPs). The results showed that MS/MS spectral similarity networking could be used as a powerful tool to quickly identify unknown TPs. A total of 6 pairs of chiral TPs were identified, among which two new TPs of MPL including hydroxy{4-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]phenyl}acetic acid (alpha-HMPLA) and 4-[2-Hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]benzaldehyde (DMPLD) were firstly reported, and proposed transformation pathways of MPL by microalgae were given. Considering the paired TPs detected and that the degradation of the two enantiomers followed first order kinetics, the two enantiomers likely had the same degradation mechanism.

AB The occurrence of emerging contaminants in our water resources poses potential threats to the livings. Due to the poor treatment in wastewater management, treatment technologies are needed to effectively remove these products for living organism safety. In this study, Graphene oxide (GO) was tested for the first time for its capacity to remove a kind of emerging wastewater contaminants, metformin. The research was conducted by using a series of systematic adsorption and kinetic experiments. The results indicated that GO could rapidly and efficiently reduce the concentration of metformin, which could provide a solution in handling this problem. The uptake of metformin on the graphene oxide was strongly dependent on temperature, pH, ionic strength, and background electrolyte. The adsorption kinetic experiments revealed that almost 80% removal of metformin was achieved within 20 min for all the doses studied, corresponding to the relatively high k(1) (0.232 min(-1)) and k(2) (0.007 g mg(-1) min(-1)) values in the kinetic models. It indicated that the highest adsorption capacity in the investigated range (q(m)) of GO for metformin was at pH 6.0 and 288 K. Thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous (Delta G(0) < 0) and exothermic (Delta H-0 < 0) process. The adsorption of metformin increased when the pH values changed from 4.0 to 6.0, and decreased adsorption were observed at pH 6.0-11.0. GO still exhibited excellent adsorption capacity after several desorption/adsorption cycles. Besides, both socalled pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds might be mainly responsible for the adsorption of metformin onto GO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The use of astaxanthin in different industries such as the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, animal feed and cosmetic has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Natural supplies of the pigment include crustacean by-products, algal, and microbial cultivation, being the yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous together with the alga Haematococcus pluvialis the most promising microorganisms for this bioproduction. Different vegetable by-products of the food industry have been explored so far as low-cost substrates for the production of astaxanthin by X. dendrorhous. This study focuses for the first time on the use of a low-cost formulated medium from a marine by-product, mussel-processing wastewater, for the production of astaxanthin by the yeast X. dendrorhous.
   Results: The yeast was able to grow in non-saccharified mussel broth, revealing the ability of the microorganism to hydrolyze glycogen. However, partial glycogen saccharification with alpha-amylase was needed for astaxanthin biosynthesis, obtaining maximal productions of 22.5-26.0 mg/L towards the end of the culture and coinciding with yeast highest amylolytic activity. Cultivations in totally-saccharified media revealed an increase in maximal cell concentrations and a decrease in maximal growth rates and astaxanthin production with increasing glucose initial concentration.
   Conclusions: Astaxanthin production was higher in partially-saccharified mussel-processing waste than in synthetic medium (yeast peptone dextrose) containing glucose as carbon source (13 mg/L), suggesting this by-product is a promising nutritive medium for astaxanthin production. The use of this effluent also contributes towards the recycling and depuration of this highly pollutant effluent.

AB The Patancheru area near Hyderabad in India is recognized as a key link in the global supply chain for many bulk drugs. A central treatment plant receives wastewater from approximately 90 different manufacturers, and the resulting complex effluent has contaminated surface, ground, and drinking water in the region. Ecotoxicological testing of the effluent has shown adverse effects for several organisms, including aquatic vertebrates, at high dilutions. In addition, a recent study of microbial communities in river sediment indicated that the contamination of antibiotic substances might contribute to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes. In an attempt to start investigating how exposure to effluent-contaminated water may directly affect humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, rats were tube-fed effluent. Several pharmaceuticals present in the effluent could be detected in rat blood serum at low concentrations. However, results from exploratory microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays indicated no marked effects on hepatic gene transcription after 5 d of exposure. Clinical analysis of blood serum constituents, used as biomarkers for human disease did not reveal any significant changes, nor was there an effect on weight gain. The authors could not find evidence for any acute toxicity in the rat; however, the authors cannot rule out that was there an effect on weight gain higher doses of effluent or a longer exposure time may still be associated with risks for terrestrial vertebrates.

AB The occurrence and concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were investigated in municipal effluents and in marine receiving water. Final effluent from four large publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and seawater collected near the respective POTW outfall discharges and a reference station were collected quarterly over one year and analyzed for 56 CECs. Several CECs were detected in effluents; naproxen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate were the compounds most frequently found and with the highest concentrations (>1?mu g/L). Gemfibrozil and naproxen had the highest seawater concentrations (0.0009 and 0.0007?mu g/L) and also were among the most frequently detected compounds. Effluent dilution factors ranged from >400 to approximately 1,000. Fewer CECs were detected and at lower concentrations in seawater collected from the reference station than at the outfall sites. Effluent concentrations for some CECs (e.g., pharmaceuticals) were inversely related to the degree of wastewater treatment. This trend was not found in seawater samples. Few temporal differences were observed in effluent or seawater samples. Effluent CEC concentrations were lower than those currently known for chronic toxicity thresholds. Nevertheless, the evaluation of potential chronic effects for CECs is uncertain because aquatic life toxicity thresholds have been developed for only a few CECs, and the effluent and seawater samples had compounds, such as nonylphenol, known to bioaccumulate in local fish. Additional data are needed to better understand the significance of CEC presence and concentrations in marine environments. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 26742682. (c) 2012 SETAC

AB The present study demonstrates the high potential for the application of a novel self assembled positively charged nanofiltration membrane, PA6DT-C, in processes such as the recovery of valuable cationic macromolecules in the bioprocess and pharmaceutical industries or removal of multi-valent cations such as dyes and heavy metals in the paper and pulp, textiles, nuclear, and automotive industries. The nanofiltration membrane, prepared in this laboratory, is further characterised and then tested for the removal and recovery of Methylene Blue from a synthetic dye house wastewater. The characterisation process involved the construction of a rejection profile for NaCl over a wide range of pH and concentration, which illustrates that the optimal process conditions for the removal of small cations using this membrane is in the region pH <8.0 and concentration less than 15 mol rn(-3). The salt rejection data was used to calculate the magnitude of the effective membrane charge density and this was found to be significantly higher for the PA6DT-C membrane than two commercially available membranes (Desal-DK and Nanomax-50). The membrane flux for this new membrane is also superior to the commercial membranes with an approximate increase of 3-4 fold. The PA6DT-C membrane was successful in removal of methylene Blue dye from synthetic dye house wastewaters achieving 98% rejection and a membrane flux of similar to 17 LMH bar(-1). Thus, this new membrane both adds to and complements the existing short supply of positively charged NF membranes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To decrease the load of pharmaceuticals to the environment, decentralized wastewater treatment has been proposed for important point-sources such as hospitals. In this study, a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was used for the dehalogenation of the iodinated X-ray contrast medium diatrizoate. The presence of biogenic palladium nanoparticles (bio-Pd) in the cathode significantly enhanced diatrizoate removal by direct electrochemical reduction and by reductive catalysis using the H-2 gas produced at the cathode of the MEC. Complete deiodination of 3.3 mu M (2 mg L-1) diatrizoate from a synthetic medium was achieved after 24 h of recirculation at an applied voltage of -0.4 V. An equimolar amount of the deiodinated metabolite 3,5-diacetamidobenzoate (DAB) was detected. Higher cell voltages increased the dehalogenation rates, resulting in a complete removal after 2 h at -0.8 V. At this cell Voltage, the MEC was also able to remove 85% of diatrizoate from hospital effluent containing 0.5 mu M (292 mu g L-1), after 24 h of recirculation. Complete removal was obtained when the effluent was continuously fed at a volumetric loading rate of 204 mg diatrizoate m(-3) total cathodic compartment (TCC) day(-1) to the MEC with a hydraulic retention time of 8 h. At -0.8 V, the MEC system could also eliminate 54% of diatrizoate from spiked urine during a 24 h recirculation experiment. The final product DAB was demonstrated to be removable by nitrifying biomass, which suggests that the combination of a MEC and bio-Pd in its cathode offers potential to dehalogenate pharmaceuticals, and to significantly lower the environmental burden of hospital waste streams.

AB Recent evidence indicates that a variety of antibiotic residues may affect the integrity of streams located downstream from wastewater treatment plants. Aquatic communities comprising bacterial and fungal decomposers and invertebrate detritivores (shredders) play an important role in the decomposition of allochthonous leaf litter, which acts as a primary energy source for small running waters. The aim of the present study was to assess whether an antibiotic mixture consisting of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H(2)O, roxithromycin, and clarithromycin has an effect on such a decomposer-detritivore system. Leaf discs were exposed to these antibiotics (total concentration of 2 or 200 mu g/L) for approximately 20 d before offering these discs and corresponding control discs to an amphipod shredder, Gammarus fossarum, in a food choice experiment. Gammarus preferred the leaf discs conditioned in the presence of the antibiotic mixture at 200 mu g/L over the control discs (pair-wise t test; p = 0.006). A similar tendency, while not significant, was observed for leaves conditioned with antibiotics at a concentration of 2 mu g/L. The number of bacteria associated with leaves did not differ between treatments at either antibiotic concentration (t test; p = 0.57). In contrast, fungal biomass (measured as ergosterol) was significantly higher in the 200 mu g/L treatment (t test; p = 0.038), suggesting that the preference of Gammarus may be related to a shift in fungal communities. Overall these results indicate that mixtures of antibiotics may disrupt important ecosystem processes such as organic matter flow in stream ecosystems, although effects are likely to be weak at antibiotic concentrations typical of streams receiving wastewater treatment plant effluents.

DE upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor; specific methanogenic activity;
   pharmaceutical wastewater; optimum operating conditions
AB A 450dm(3) pilot-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used for the treatment of a fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The UASB reactor performed well up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 10.7kg COD m(-3) d(-1) at which point 94% COD removal efficiency was achieved. This high treatment efficiency did not continue, however and the UASB reactor was then operated at lower OLRs for the remainder of the study. Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests were, therefore, carried out to determine the potential loading capacity of the UASB reactor. For this purpose, the SMA tests were carried out at four different initial acetate concentrations, namely 500mg dm(-3), 1000mgdm(-3), 1500mgdm(-3) and 2000mgdm(-3) so that substrate limitation could not occur. The results showed that the sludge sample taken from the UASB reactor (OLR of 6.1kg COD m(-3) d(-1)) had a potential acetoclastic methane production (PMP) rate of 72 cm(3) CH4 g(-1) VSS d(-1). When the PMP rate was compared with the actual methane production rate (AMP) of 67cm(3) CH, g(-1) VSS d(-1) obtained from the UASB reactor, the AMP/PMP ratio was found to be 0.94 which ensured that the UASB reactor was operated using its maximum potential acetoclastic methanogenic capacity. In order to achieve higher OLRs with desired COD removal efficiencies it was recommended that the UASB reactor should be loaded with suitable OLRs pre-determined by SMA tests.

AB Phosphorus excessively discharged into the water body is a primary cause of eutrophication, but phosphorus resource is limited and non-renewable. If phosphorus could be recovered from wastewaters, it can not only prevent phosphorus pollution but also achieve the recycling of phosphorus resources. This work proposed a novel strategy, Fe2+/H2O2-strengite method with the enhanced settlement, for phosphorus removal and recovery from pharmaceutical wastewater containing organic phosphorus (OP). In this scheme, OP could be converted into inorganic phosphorus (IP) in the Fe2+/H2O2 oxidation system, and then IP was recovered in the strengite system. This approach possessed the advantages of simple operation, high efficiency and valuable recovery products, besides, reducing the consumption of reagents, and hardly resulting in secondary pollution. Sixty cycles of phosphorus removal and recovery experiments were conducted, in which pH value was 4 and the initial molar ratio of Fe/P was 1.5. This process achieved a satisfactory and steady phosphorus removal performance, with soluble phosphate and total phosphorus removal efficiencies of 95.3% +/- 1.7% and 91.4% +/- 2.5%, respectively, and phosphorus was recovered. Possible mechanisms involved: the formation of amorphous strengite (FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O) analogue, the adsorption of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) to phosphorus, and the flocculation of ferric salts. Besides, the presence of quartz as carriers could enhance the settling efficiency of products. Also, via various characterizations, products included amorphous strengite analogue and goethite mixed with phosphorus. This work provided an effective method to reduce OP pollution and recover phosphorus, and supplied thoughts for the treatment of refractory pollutants and the recycling of limited resources.

AB Chemical-contaminant mixtures are widely reported in large stream reaches in urban/agriculture-developed watersheds, but mixture compositions and aggregate biological effects are less well understood in corresponding smaller headwaters, which comprise most of stream length, riparian connectivity, and spatial biodiversity. During 20142017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States (US) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric ToxCast (TM) exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (rho): 0.5690.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (rho: 0.225353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (rho: -0.373 to -0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities.

TI Pharmaceuticals in farms and surrounding surface water bodies: Hazard

SO CHEMOSPHERE

DT Article
DE Pharmaceuticals; Veterinary; Livestock; Ecotoxicity; Environmental risk
AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is known to have multiple origins; livestock activities comprise one scarcely studied source, both globally and specially in Latin-America. This work aims to study the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater from swine farms and their surrounding surface waters, in a highland livestock production area of Costa Rica. The monitoring of 70 pharmaceutical active compounds resulted in the detection of 10 molecules in farm wastewater (influents and effluents of the on-farm treatment system), including compounds of animal and human use. A 57% of effluents showed high hazard (Sigma HQ > 1), mainly due to the compounds risperidone, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen. Additionally, ecotoxicological tests with Daphnia magna and Microtox classified at least 21% of the effluents as very toxic (10 < TU <= 100); likewise, 86% of effluents exhibited germination index (GI) inhibition values over 90% for Lactuca sativa. Seven molecules were detected in surface water, six of them of human use (1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, cephalexin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen) and one (acetaminophen) of dual (human and veterinary) use; nonetheless, most of the detections were found in sampling points closer to human settlements than animal farms. Considering the set of molecules and their distribution, the livestock influence on surface water seems minimal in comparison with the urban influence. Only 16% of surface water samples showed high risk, mainly due to ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and caffeine; similarly, 45% samples presented GI inhibition >20% (no toxicity was determined towards Daphnia magna or Microtox). These findings in surface water suggest an incipient environmental risk in the area. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrification process has been reported to be capable of degrading various pharmaceuticals due to the cometabolism of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) is an emerging configuration in wastewater treatment with advantages of high nitrification rate and low energy consumption. However, there are very few studies investigating the degradation of antibiotics at environmentally relevant levels in nitrifying MABR systems. In this study, the removal of two widely used antibiotics, cephalexin (CFX) and sulfadiazine (SDZ), was evaluated in two independent MABRs with nitrifying biofilms. The impacts of CFX and SDZ exposure on the nitrification performance and microbial community structure within biofilms were also investigated. The results showed that nitrifying biofilms were very efficient in removing CFX (94.6%) and SDZ (75.4%) with an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L when hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 4 h in the reactors. When HRT decreased from 4 h to 3 h, the removal rates of CFX and SDZ increased significantly from 23.4 +/- 1.0 mu g/(L.h) and 18.7 +/- 1.1 mu g/(L.h), respectively, to 27.7 +/- 1.3 mg/(L.h) (p<0.01) and 20.8 +/- 2.4 mg/(L.h) (p<0.05), while the removal efficiencies decreased to 86.0% and 61.5%, respectively. Despite the exposure to CFX and SDZ, the nitrification performance was not affected, and microbial community structure within biofilms also remained relatively stable. This study shows that nitrifying MABR process is a promising option for the efficient removal of antibiotics from domestic wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is increasingly used as tertiary treatment for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) from wastewater (WW). To enhance the sorption kinetics and capacity, the PAC particles can be milled down to superfine powdered activated carbon (SPAC). However, the smallgrained SPAC particles are prone to aggregation, which may impact their treatment performance. In this study we examined the effect of SPAC dispersion and aggregation on TrOC removal kinetics and sorption capacity. Specifically, we assessed how two interventions that modulate the apparent size of SPAC - ultrasonication and coagulation - affect the uptake of TrOCs in secondary WW effluent. We quantified the removal of fourteen TrOCs, of which twelve are indicator substances for micropollutant removal in WWTPs as designated by the Swiss Water Protection Ordinance. We determined that at high SPAC doses (> 1.6 mgSPAC/mg Dissolved Organic Carbon [DOC]), the TrOC removal kinetics were fast even for aggregated SPAC, such that SPAC dispersal by ultrasonication yielded no benefit. At low SPAC doses ( < 1.6 mgSPAC/mgDOC) and contact times (< 2 minutes) ultrasonication was beneficial, in particular if the SPAC particles reached complete dispersion prior to exposure to TrOCs. However, the energy consumption of such an ultrasonication step should be carefully weighed against the additional energy requirement associated with using a higher SPAC dose. Finally, a coagulant to mitigate membrane fouling can be added simultaneously with the SPAC without compromising the TrOC removal efficiency. We conclude that under realistic SPAC application scenarios in WWTPs, interventions that disperse SPAC during TrOC sorption are not necessary, and processes that aggregate SPAC are acceptable.

AB Chloroxylenol (CHL) is an antimicrobial ingredient that is frequently used in antiseptics/disinfectants for skin (e.g. hand soap) and non-living surfaces. CHL is an alternative to triclosan and triclocarban, the use of which has recently been banned in some countries. Accordingly, the more widespread use of CHL may significantly increase its occurrence and level in aquatic environments in the near future, eventually resulting in potential ecological risks. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may be a point source of CHL in natural environments due to extensive discharge through urban waste stream disposal. While the satisfactory removal of CHL in WWTPs is critical for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems, the extent of CHL removal and whether CHL causes system upset/failure in WWTPs currently remain unknown. In the present study, we conducted bio reactor operation and batch experiments to investigate the fate and effects of CHL and elucidate the mechanisms underlying degradation at various levels from environmentally relevant to high levels (0.5-5 mg L-1). Biorcactors partially removed CHL (44-87%) via a largely biological route. Microbial association networks constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data revealed selective enrichment and a correlation between Sphingobium and CHL, implying its involvement in the biological breakdown of CHL through dehalogenation and ring hydroxylation pathways. The present results provide insights into the behavior and effects of CHL in activated sludge communities and important information for the sustainable management of CHL that may be an emerging issue in the urban water cycle.

AB In this work, the partition of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in colloid-bound and truly dissolved phases in municipal wastewater before and after advanced treatment processes was determined. The effluents, which were filtered using a 0.45 mu m membrane, were further separated with the 1 kDa cross-flow ultrafiltration system into two phases, namely, colloidal phase (0.45 mu m-1 kDa) and soluble phase (<1 kDa), and the partition coefficients of typical EDCs to colloids (Kcoc) were calculated. The removal of typical EDCs and their estrogenic activity in secondary effluent by coagulation sedimentation (CS), granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, magnetic ion exchange resin (NDMP), and ozone processes was compared. Results show that the percentages of colloid-bound EDCs were noteworthy and ranged between 7.8% and 44.3% in secondary effluents. The reduction in EDCs resulting from the GAC adsorption process was positively correlated to their logKcoc, thus suggesting that the adsorption of EDCs onto granular activated carbon and colloids exhibited a similar phenomenal character. Ozone oxidation was most effective in removing both colloidal phase and soluble phase EDCs, whereas CS displayed a relatively adequate performance in reducing colloidal EDCs. EDCs with lower Kow values exhibited higher removal by ion exchange resin. The combination of modified NDMP and ozonation processes achieved the best performance in reducing estrogenic activity and satisfying the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC).

AB Due to ineffective wastewater treatment technologies, pharmaceuticals such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)-a common class of antidepressants which inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT)-can be found in surface waters and marine receiving waters near wastewater effluents. Understanding how exposure to these chemicals might impact non-target organisms, especially combined with other environmental stressors like hypoxia, is essential in order to thoroughly evaluate environmental risk. It was hypothesized that both acute and chronic exposure to the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX) would interfere with the metabolic hypoxia response of the Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta. Here we demonstrate that acute intraperitoneal treatment with 50 mu g g(-1) FLX significantly reduces the regulation index, or degree of metabolic regulation, in toadfish. Acute FLX exposure significantly reduced SERT mRNA expression in the first and third gill arches, but mRNA expression was not affected in heart tissues or in the second gill arch. In contrast, the regulation index was unaffected by 14-17 day waterborne FLX exposure to environmentally relevant (0.01 mu g L-1) and approximately 1000-fold higher (8.5 mu g L-1) concentrations. However, the higher concentration was sufficient to induce a systemic elevation in plasma serotonin concentrations. Chronic FLX exposure did not alter SERT mRNA expression in heart or gill tissues. The results of this study implicate the involvement of 5-HT pathways in hypoxia tolerance but demonstrate that current environmental levels of FLX are insufficient to impair the metabolic hypoxia response in marine fish.

AB Present study investigates the potential of Ti/RuO2 electrode for degradation and mineralization of Ofloxacin (OFLX) antibiotic from synthetic wastewater by electro-oxidation (EO) method, not reported earlier. Effects of various EO parameters such as applied current (I), initial pH, initial OFLX concentration (C-0) and supporting electrolyte concentration on %OFLX removal efficiency and %TOC removal efficiency were systematically studied and reported. Decay kinetics of OFLX by varying C-0 and applied I were also studied. Additionally, mineralization current efficiency and specific energy consumption of OFLX mineralization were evaluated. Moreover, mode of oxidation method involved (direct and/or indirect oxidation) was also explored. Major OFLX transformation products during EO were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and possible degradation reaction mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, operating cost analysis was performed to check the economic feasibility of the EO process.
   The optimum pH and current (I) were found to be approximate to 6.8 (natural pH of OFLX wastewater) and 1 A, respectively. Mineralization current efficiency decreased from 7.8% to 4.9% with increase in I value from 0.25 to 1 A. approximate to 80% of OFLX removal in 30 min of electrolysis and 463% TOC removal in 240 min of electrolysis at I = 1 A were observed. Pseudo-first-order kinetic model best fitted the experimental data showing R-2 value approximate to 0.99 for all the C-0 and applied I studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical drugs are continuously discharged into the aquatic environment primarily through wastewater discharge; therefore, their possible effects on wildlife is a reason of concern. Diazepam is a widely prescribed benzodiazepine drug used to treat insomnia and anxiety disorders, and it has been found in wastewater effluents worldwide. The present study tested the effects of diazepam on fecundity and the reproductive behavior of the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, a fish that exhibits male parental care. Sexually mature fathead minnows were housed at a ratio of one male and two females per tank and exposed to nominal (measured) concentrations of 0, 0.1 (0.14 +/- 0.06), 1.0 (1.04 +/- 0.15), 10 (13.4 +/- 1.5) mu g L-1 for 21 days. Fish receiving the low diazepam treatment had significantly larger clutches than fish receiving the highest concentration but neither were different from controls. Diazepam exposure was not associated with a significant change in fertilization rate, hatchability or time to hatch, but a trend toward a higher number of eggs/day was observed in fish exposed to the low diazepam concentration relative to those exposed to the medium concentration. There were no significant differences in any of the behaviors analyzed when responses were averaged over time. The results showed that exposure to diazepam at concentrations as high as 13 mu g L-1 did not significantly impact the reproductive behavior of fathead minnow. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP), tamoxifen (TAM) and cyclophosphamide (CP) which are often used in anticancer treatment are released in hospital effluent and into the environment. Although the concentrations are low (from ng/L to mu g/L), no data exist concerning their ecotoxicological impact. In this study two biomarkers of early effect were performed on hepatic cells (HepG2): cell viability and genotoxicity (DNA breaks) using cell proliferative assay and comet assay, respectively. These data were compared with two standardized ecotoxicological tests: algaltoxkit F (TM) and microtox(R). Cells were exposed to an increasing amount of an individual drug or in a mixture for 24,48 or 72 h. The time-exposure of bacteria and algae ranged between 5 and 30 min and 72 h, respectively. A non-monotonic dose-response on cell viability was observed when HepG2 cells were exposed to TAM alone or in the presence of CIR The same scheme was observed with microtox(R) when the bacteria were exposed to the mixtures. On the other side, an individual drug does not induce any DNA breaks on hepatic cells, whereas a mixture leads to a dose dependent increase of DNA breaks. Similarly a positive response was observed with algaltoxkit F (TM) only with mixtures. Synergistic effects observed when drugs are in a mixture highlight the importance of investigating the ecotoxicological effects of contaminants at low concentrations and in mixtures.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the photocatalytic removal of PPCPs using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polymer. PEDOT is a conducting polymer that exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity and was used in this study without any additives or metal co-catalysts. The PEDOT was synthesized using chemical oxidative polymerization and characterized further for composition and morphology. PEDOT, in the presence of UV irradiation, showed >99% degradation of one of the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drugs, metformin, within 60 min. The effect of varying concentration of PEDOT, pH, and light irradiance was studied to achieve maximum photocatalytic efficiency. Two major degradation products of metformin of m/z 116 and 126 were detected using triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS, while the degradation kinetics was found to be of pseudo-first-order. Results revealed that photogenerated electrons, holes, and radical species played a role in the PPCPs' degradation. When a mixture of seven PPCPs in the ultra-pure water matrix was tested, more than 99% removal was observed for most of the PPCPs within 60 min. The removal efficiency decreased in a real wastewater effluent due to the presence of dissolved organic matter; however, still, more than 50% removal was observed for majority of the studied PPCPs. The results of PEDOT reusability revealed that the reuse contributed to the drop in the conductivity and subsequent drop in the photocatalytic activity; however, a simple acid treatment was found to be effective to recoup its conductivity. PEDOT was successfully immobilized on an electrospun fiber mat to enhance its applicability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Resin fraction of dissolved organic matters (DOM) was used to investigate the mechanism of catalytic ozonation with a commercial catalyst treating petrochemical secondary effluent (PSE). The results showed hydrophilic substances (HI) and hydrophobic acids (HoA) were the dominated fractions in PSE, accounting for about 47% and 36% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC). HoA could be more easily oxidized by ozone than HI. It may be ascribed to the highly reactive structures of HoA with high SUVA(254). Besides, HoA could be transformed into HI during ozonation. Compared to ozonation, catalytic ozonation could enhance more removal of HI than HoA. Radical scavenger experiment verified that HoA and HI were removed by both ozone molecules and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot). The adsorption of DOM by catalyst kept a dynamic balance process between oxidation and re-adsorption during catalytic ozonation, triggering a cyclic reaction between adsorbed DOM and adsorbed ozone as well as decomposed (OH)-O-center dot from the adsorbed ozone. In addition, DOM and ozone adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst simultaneously could protect the quencher of (OH)-O-center dot caused by high concentration of anions (mainly Cl- and SO42-) in the bulk solution and significantly improve the catalytic performance. The fractions reaction and transformation, dynamic process between oxidation and re-adsorption, role of adsorption and (OH)-O-center dot quencher protection were clearly interpreted. For catalytic ozonation, the key point is to achieve an equilibrium for the adsorption of organics and oxidation ability. The proposed mechanism can give the direction for synthesis or modification of catalyst for real wastewater treatment.

AB Poor surface characteristics and mechanical strength have impeded the industrial utilization of starch based polymers for wastewater treatment. Though miniaturization of adsorbent materials to nano scale level, has improved the surface area of materials, nano-scale adsorbents often form stable colloidal suspension/emulsion, and thus pose separation challenges. This study was designed to develop a novel starch-based magnetic polyurethane polymer for removal of tetracycline antibiotics from water media. Magnetic starch was synthesized by in-situ co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the presence of starch, and thereafter subjected to one-step reticulation with 4,4-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate to produce magnetic starch polyurethane polymer nanocomposite (MSPP). The characterization studies with FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, BET, and XRF indicated successful synthesis. The characterization, adsorption isotherm and pH studies indicated pi-pi and pi-cation interaction as possible adsorption interactions. Besides optimization of desirable properties of MSPP, the RSM approach provided empirical evidence for the existence of the suggested adsorption interaction, as adsorption increased with increment in magnetite content and degree of crosslinking of the MSPP nanocomposite which were responsible for pi-cation and pi-pi interactions, respectively. The adsorption/desorption profile of MSPP indicated multiple potential applications beyond water treatment. Aside incorporation of magnetic separation, the regenerability, cheap, and sustainable nature of starch precursor confers a comparative cost advantage to the developed polymer. Considering its effectiveness in both simulated and real-time wastewater samples, MSPP holds great promise for commercialization of starch-based polymer adsorbents beyond decontamination applications.

AB With the increased detections of commonly used pharmaceuticals in surface water and wastewater, extensive attentions were paid recently to the fate and transport of these pharmaceuticals in the environment. Amitriptyline (AMI) is a tricyclic antidepressant widely applied to treat patients with anxiety and depression. In this study, the removal of AMI with palygorskite clay (PFI-1) was investigated under different physico-chemical conditions and supplemented by instrumental analyses. The uptake of AMI on PFI-1 was well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm with an adsorption capacity of 0.168 mmol g(-1) at pH 6-7. The AMI uptake was fast and reached equilibrium in 15 min. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed no shift of the (110) peak position of palygorskite after AMI uptake. However, the (001) peak position of the minor component smectite (about 10%) shifted to lower angle as the amounts of AMI input increased. These results suggested surface uptake of AMI on palygorsldte and interlayer uptake of AMI in smectite. As smectite is a common component of palygorskite clays, its role in assessing the properties and performances of palygorskite clays for the uptake and removal of contaminants should not be neglected. Overall, the high affinity of AMI for PFI-1 and strong retention of AMI on PFI-1 suggested that it could be a good adsorbent to remove AMI from wastewater. Palygorskite clays can also be a sink for many cationic pharmaceuticals in the environmental of the arid regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seven mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with different design configurations, dealing with primary-treated urban wastewater, were assessed for the concentration, distribution and fate of ten pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) [ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, caffeine, carbamazepine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide] and eight of their transformation products (TPs). Apart from influent and effluent, various CW compartments were analysed, namely, substrate, plant roots and pore water. PPCP content in pore water depended on the specific CW configuration. Macrophytes can take up PPCPs through their roots. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide were present on the root surface with a predominance of galaxolide and caffeine in all the planted systems. Naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylic acid, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide were uptaken by the roots. In order to better understand the removal processes, biomass measurement and biodegradability studies through the characterization of internal-external isomeric linear alkylbenzenes present on the gravel bed were performed. Three TPs namely, ibuprofen-amide, 3-ethylbenzophenone and 4-hydroxy-diclofenac were identified for the first time in wetland pore water and effluent water, which suggests de novo formation (they were not present in the influent). Conversely, O-desmethyl-naproxen was degraded through the wetland passage since it was detected in the influent but not in the subsequent treatment stages. Biodegradation pathways are therefore suggested for most of the studied PPCPs in the assessed CWs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study compared the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by conventional ozonation and the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process, which involves electrochemically generating H2O2 in-situ from O-2 in sparged O-2 and O-3 gas mixture (i.e., ozone generator effluent) during ozonation. Several pharmaceuticals with k(O3) ranging from <0.1 to 6.8 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) were spiked into four secondary effluents collected from different WWTPs, and then treated by ozonation and the E-peroxone process. Results show that both processes can rapidly remove ozone reactive pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and gemfibrozil), while the E-peroxone process can considerably accelerate the removal of ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals (e.g., ibuprofen and clofibric acid) via indirect oxidation with (OH)-O-center dot generated from the reaction of sparged O-3 with electro-generated H2O2. Compared with ozonation, the E-peroxone process enhanced the removal kinetics of ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals in the four secondary effluents by similar to 40-170%, and the enhancement was more pronounced in secondary effluents that had relatively lower effluent organic matter (EfOM). Due to its higher efficiency for removing ozone-refractory pharmaceuticals, the E-peroxone process reduced the reaction time and electrical energy consumption required to remove >= 90% of all spiked pharmaceuticals from the secondary effluents as compared to ozonation. These results indicate that the E-peroxone process may provide a simple and effective way to improve existing ozonation system for pharmaceutical removal from secondary effluents.

AB Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a group of pharmaceuticals widely prescribed to lower blood pressure and treat heart diseases. They have been frequently detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and downstream river waters, thus inducing a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about the behavior and fate of CCBs under UV irradiation, which has been adopted as a primary disinfection method for WWTP effluents. This study investigated the degradation kinetics and pathways of three commonly-used CCBs, including amlodipine (AML), diltiazem (DIL), and verapamil (VER), under UV (254 nm) irradiation. The chemical structures of transformation byproducts (TBPs) were first identified to assess the potential ecological hazards. On that basis, a generic solid-phase extraction method, which simultaneously used four different cartridges, was adopted to extract and enrich the TBPs. Thereafter, the photo-degradation of target CCBs was performed under UV fluences typical for WWTP effluent disinfection. The degradation of all three CCBs conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetics, with rate constants of 0.031, 0.044 and 0.011 min(-1) for AML, DIL and VER, respectively. By comparing the MS2 fragments and the evolution (i.e., formation or decay) trends of identified TBPs, the degradation pathways were proposed. In the WWTP effluent, although the target CCBs could be degraded, several TBPs still contained the functional pharmacophores and reached peak concentrations under UV fluences of 40-100 mJ cm(-2).

AB Phenazone-type pharmaceuticals, such as aminopyrine, metamizole, phenazone and propyphenazone, are widely used analgesics that have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents in mu g L-1 concentrations. Acetamido antipyrine (AAA) and formyl aminoantipyrine (FAA) - the main metabolites of aminopyrine and metamizole - have also been detected in sub mu g L-1 concentrations in environmental water bodies and in resources used to produce drinking water, suggesting their highly persistent character. In this study phenazone, propyphenazone, AAA and FAA were treated with ozone under laboratory conditions and 17 degradation products were identified by an elucidation approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap). Typical oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds by ozone was observed among other mechanisms of ring opening. It was demonstrated that reactivity of these compounds with ozone is high (rate constants k(O3) ranging from 6.5 x 10(4) to 2.4 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)). The toxicity of the degradation products from ozonation was estimated by quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). It was shown that, when the carbon-carbon double bond is partially oxidized to an epoxy, the toxicity towards fish and daphnids is higher than that of the parent compound. By further oxidizing the molecules, a common degradation product - 1-acety1-1-methy1-2-phenylhydrazide (AMPH) - was also found to be more toxic than its parent compounds, which is of concern since this compound has previously been reported in environmental waters.

AB A bio-trickling filter packed with fibrous balls, ZX02, packing material was tested to treat a mixed waste gas containing butyl acetate (BA), n-butyl alcohol (n-BA) and phenylacetic acid (PA), which were discharged from penicillin workshop in a pharmaceutical factory. In order to investigate the effect of various factors such as inlet loading and spray water flow rate on the removal rate of these three volatile pollutants, a field experiment was carried out continuously for more than 3 months using a pilot bio-trickling filter and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as spray water during the pilot experiment. The removal rates of BA, n-BA and PA was 95%, 92% and nearly 100%, when their inlet concentration was lower than 2200, 2400 and 370 mg m(-3), respectively. To maintain 90% removal of BA, n-BA and PA, acceptable maximum inlet loadings cannot exceed 373.4, 317.2 and 209.5g m(-3) h(-1), respectively. The effluent from the secondary sedimentation tank of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant can be used as spray water, and its optimal flow rate was determined to be 9.5-10.5 L h(-1). The bio-trickling filter had significant ability to resist shock of high inlet loading while maintaining low resistances to air flow. Therefore, it can be operated for long-term without frequent backwashing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB Organic micropollutants enter rivers mainly with discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems and water quality. A considerable knowledge gap exists for disentangling overlapping processes and driving conditions that control the fate of these pollutants. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the driving parameters for attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, tramadol and venlafaxine) under field conditions. The presented study was performed at a small river (Ammer River, mean discharge 0.87 m3 s-1) which is hydrologically complex due to karstification, numerous artificial discharges, and engineered modifications of the channel. We applied a Lagrangian sampling scheme at two sequential river reaches. In general, for the investigated compounds and over the length of the tested reaches, the absolute net attenuation representative for 24 h was low (<= 23% net attenuation), yet calculated half-lives were comparable to literature. Photodegradation is specifically relevant for the first river reach characterized by a higher net attenuation of the photosensitive compound diclofenac (14.5% +/- 11.3%) compared to the second section (9.8% +/- 13.7%). This is likely due to a spatial difference in canopy shading, which is supported by significant correlations (R2 >= 0.8) of the temporally changing 'temperature' and 'solar radiation' with time-specific degradation rate constants of photosensitive compounds for consecutive hourly water parcels. In general, the presented spatially and temporally resolved approach is a suitable tool to determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants and to narrow down the interpretation of net attenuation to a few reasonable processes.

AB Heterogeneous Fenton oxidation using Fe-zeolite catalyst (of ZSM5 type) was investigated for the removal of ibuprofen (20 mg/L) in water. In particular, the effects of catalyst concentration, oxidant dosage, temperature, solution pH, and water matrix on pollutant conversion and mineralization were evaluated. The activity of lea-ched iron species in solution was also measured to determine the contribution of the homogeneous reaction.
   Oxidation rate of ibuprofen obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the pollutant concentration, and the apparent rate constant increased with catalyst and hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the investigated ranges (1-5 g/L of Fe-zeolite and 0.5-7 times the stoichiometric amount of oxidant). Energy activation of 53 kJ/mol was obtained from Arrhenius plot However, the mineralization yield was not significantly improved by a too large excess of H2O2 or increase of temperature. In the selected conditions (25 degrees C, 4.8 g/L of catalyst, 2 times the stoichiometric amount of H2O2), 88% of ibuprofen and 27% of TOC were removed after 3 hours of reaction under "natural" pH conditions.
   Very low leaching (up to 0.2 mg/L) and negligible activity of leached iron in solution indicated that Fenton reaction was mainly induced by iron species on the catalyst surface.
   Degradation rate of ibuprofen was slower in wastewater effluent as compared to distilled water, mainly due to alkaline buffering and radical scavenging effects of organic and inorganic compounds present in the matrix.
   Mono- and multi-hydroxylated ibuprofen adducts were found as main oxidation intermediates -in line with free-radical mechanism- as well as 4-isobutylacetophenone from decarboxylation route.

AB Parabens are widely used as antimicrobial and preservatives in pharmaceutical and personal care products and are continuously reaching the water streams. Conventional wastewater treatments are proven inefficient on the removal of this kind of contaminants from wastewater. Therefore, catalytic ozonation appears as a suitable option, due to the oxidant power of ozone and its high capacity of hydroxyl radical generation in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The main drawback of catalytic ozonation is related with the choice of stable and active catalysts at low cost. On this way, two volcanic rocks were tested to enhance the removal of a mixture of parabens by ozonation, improving their degradation. Indeed, catalytic ozonation with volcanic rock allowed total paraben degradation using a transferred ozone dose (TOD) of 55 mg/L which corresponds to a reduction of about threefold the amount of TOD comparatively with single ozonation (170 mg/L of TOD). Due to the presence of semiconductors on volcanic rock composition, the effect of UVA irradiation on paraben degradation was analyzed. The neutral and basic conditions enhanced catalytic ozonation comparatively to acid conditions. Higher pH values allowed a total methylparaben degradation with 35 mg O-3/L, whereas for low pH values, 55 mg O-3/L was required. The use of a radical scavenger proven that hydroxyl radicals are the main responsible for paraben degradation with catalytic ozonation. This was confirmed through the analysis of the by-products, where 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and hydroquinone were quantified.

AB In this study, we examined the feasibility of membrane distillation (MD) for removing trace organic compounds (TrOCs) during water and wastewater treatment. A set of 29 compounds was selected to represent major TrOC groups, including pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones, phytoestrogens, UV-filters, industrial chemicals, and pesticides that occur ubiquitously in municipal wastewater. Results reported here suggest that rejection and fate and transport of TrOCs during MD are governed by their volatility and, to a lesser extent, hydrophobicity. All TrOCs with pK(H)>9 (which can be classified as non-volatile) were well removed by MD. Among the 29 TrOCs investigated in this study, three compounds (i.e. 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-tert-butylphenol and benzophenone) possess moderate volatility (pK(H)<9) and therefore had the lowest rejection efficiencies of 54%, 73% and 66%, respectively. The results suggest that the rejection of TrOCs with pK(H)<9 may be governed by the interplay between their hydrophobicity and volatility. In addition, the fate and transport of the TrOCs during the MD process was also investigated. Hydrophilic TrOCs having negligible volatility were concentrated in the feed, while hydrophobic compounds with moderate volatility were substantially lost due to evaporation or adsorption. When MD treatment was integrated with a thermophilic membrane bioreactor (MBR), near complete removal (>95%) of all 29 TrOCs investigated in this study was achieved despite their diverse physicochemical properties (i.e. hydrophobicity, persistency and volatility). The results suggest that MD could be a promising post-treatment to be used in conjunction with thermophilic MBR for TrOC removal. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Immobilization is an important method to increase enzyme stability and allow enzyme reuse. One interesting application in the field of environmental biotechnology is the immobilization of laccase to eliminate phenolic contaminants via oxidation. Fumed silica nanoparticles have interesting potential as support material for laccase immobilization via sorption-assisted immobilization in the perspective of applications such as the elimination of micropollutants in aqueous phases. Based on these facts, the present work aimed to formulate laccase-nanoparticle conjugates with defined laccase combinations in order to obtain nanobiocatalysts, which are active over a broad range of pH values and possess a large substrate spectrum to suitably address pollution by multiple contaminants. A multi-enzymatic approach was investigated by immobilizing five different types of laccases originating from a Thielavia genus, Coriolopsis polyzona, Cerrena unicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus, and Trametes versicolor onto fumed silica nanoparticles, separately and in combinations. The laccases differed concerning their pH optima and substrate affinity. Exploiting their differences allowed the formulation of tailor-made nanobiocatalysts. In particular, the production of a nanobiocatalyst could be achieved that retained a higher percentage of its relative activity over the tested pH range (3-7) compared to the dissolved or separately immobilized enzymes. Furthermore, a nanobiocatalyst could be formulated able to oxidize a broader substrate range than the dissolved or separately immobilized enzymes. Thereby, the potential of the nanobiocatalyst for application in biochemical oxidation applications such as the elimination of multiple target pollutants in biologically treated wastewater has been illustrated.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals are widely prescribed in the United States; release of municipal wastewater effluent is a primary route introducing them to aquatic environments, where little is known about their distribution and fate. Water, bed sediment, and brain tissue from native white suckers (Catostomus commersoni)were collected upstream and at points progressively downstream from outfalls discharging to two effluent-impacted streams, Boulder Creek (Colorado) and Fourmile Creek (Iowa). A liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was used to quantify antidepressants, including fluoxetine, norfluoxetine (degradate), sertraline, norsertraline (degradate), paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion in all three sample matrices. Antidepressants were not present above the limit of quantitation in water samples upstream from the effluent outfalls but were present at points downstream at ng/L concentrations, even at the farthest downstream sampling site 8.4 km downstream from the outfall. The antidepressants with the highest measured concentrations in both streams were venlafaxine, bupropion, and citalopram and typically were observed at concentrations of at least an order of magnitude greater than the more commonly investigated antidepressants fluoxetine and sertraline. Concentrations of antidepressants in bed sediment were measured at ng/g levels; venlafaxine and fluoxetine were the predominant chemicals observed. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and their degradates were the principal antidepressants observed in fish brain tissue, typically at low ng/g concentrations. A qualitatively different antidepressant profile was observed in brain tissue compared to streamwater samples. This study documents that wastewater effluent can be a point source of antidepressants to stream ecosystems and that the qualitative composition of antidepressants in brain tissue from exposed fish differs substantially from the compositions observed in streamwater and sediment, suggesting selective uptake.

AB Sources for drinking water (DW) production contain increasing concentrations of organic micropollutants, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Traditional purification processes are not suitable for their removal or conversion, but even sophisticated technologies, like advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration, are not able to efficiently remove all compounds from DW. For recalcitrant compounds, affinity adsorption, based on a specific interaction of the adsorbent surface with functional groups in the compounds' molecular structure, may be an effective alternative or addition. It can either be applied as a polishing step in DW purification or for removal of compounds directly at the source.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are ubiquitous in natural waters even in places where the human activity is limited. The presence of OMPs in natural water sources for human consumption encourages the evaluation of different water purification technologies to ensure water quality. In this study, the Biobio river (Chile) was selected since the watershed includes urban settlements and economic activities (i.e. agriculture, forestry) that incorporate a variety of OMPs into the aquatic environment, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Atrazine (herbicide), caffeine (psychotropic), diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) and triclosan (antimicrobial) in Biobio river water and in different stages of a drinking and two wastewater treatment plants downstream Biobio river were determined using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI). Quantification of these four compounds showed concentrations in the range of 8 +/- 2 to 55 +/- 10 ng L-1 in Biobio river water, 11 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 21 ng L-1 in the drinking water treatment plant, and 60 +/- 10 to 15,000 +/- 1300 ng L-1 in the wastewater treatment plants. Caffeine was used as an indicator of wastewater discharges.
   Because conventional water treatment technologies are not designed to eliminate some emerging organic pollutants, alternative treatment processes, UV and UV/H2O2, were employed. The transformation of atrazine, carbamazepine (antiepileptic), diclofenac and triclosan was investigated at laboratory scale. Both processes were tested at different UV doses and the Biobio river water matrix effects were evaluated. Initial H2O2 concentration used was 10 mg L-1. Results showed that, the transformation profile obtained using UV/H2O2 at UV doses up to 900 mJ cm(-2), followed the trend of diclofenac > triclosan > atrazine > carbamazepine. Furthermore acute toxicity tests with Daphnia magna were carried out after UV/H2O2 treatments of the OMPs mixture studied. At the lower UV doses tested (300 mJ cm(-2)) a higher toxicity was observed, suggesting the formation of toxic intermediates in the course of the reaction. As expected, at higher UV doses the toxicity declined. Considering the treatment of the mixture of ATZ, CBZ, DCL and TCS with a UV dose of 1200 mJ cm(-2) and 10 mg L-1 of H2O2 the acute toxicity results exhibits values for Daphnia magna immobilization equal to 20 and 42% evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively.

AB This study consists of a review on the removal efficiencies of a wide spectrum of micropollutants (MPs) in biolog-ical treatment (mainly membrane bioreactor) coupled with activated carbon (AC) (AC added in the bioreactor or followed by an AC unit, acting as a post treatment). It focuses on how the presence of AC may promote the re-moval of MPs and the effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater. Removal data collected of MPs are analysed versus AC dose if powdered AC is added in the bioreactor, and as a function of the empty bed contact time in the case of a granular activated carbon (GAC) column acting as a post treatment. Moreover, the enhance-ment in macropollutant (organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds) removal is analysed as well as the AC mitigation effect towards membrane fouling and, finally, how sludge properties may change in the pres-ence of AC. To sum up, it was found that AC improves the removal of most MPs, favouring their sorption on the AC surface, promoted by the presence of different functional groups and then enhancing their degradation processes. DOM is a strong competitor in sorption on the AC surface, but it may promote the transformation of GAC in a bi-ologically activated carbon thus enhancing all the degradation processes. Finally, AC in the bioreactor increases sludge floc strength and improves its settling characteristics and sorption potential. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE Pharmaceutical; Degradation; Photocatalyst; Solar light
AB The environmental-friendly photocatalytic process with a magnetic catalyst CoFe2O4/TiO2 mediated by solar light for ibuprofen (IBP) degradation in pure water, wastewater effluent and artificial seawater was investigated systematically. The study aims to reveal the efficiency, the mechanism and toxicity evolution during IBP degradation. Hydroxyl radicals and photo-hole (h(+)) were found to contribute to the IBP decay. The presence of SO42- showed no significant effect, while NO3- accelerated the photodegradation, and other anions including HOC3-, Cl-, F-, and Br- showed significant inhibition. The removal efficiency was significantly elevated with the addition of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) or persulfate (PS) ([Oxidant](0):[IBP](0) = 0.4-4), with reaction rate of 5.3-13.1 and 1.3-2.9 times as high as the control group, respectively. However, the reaction was slowed down with the introduction of H2O2. A mathematic model was employed to describe the effect of ferrate, high concentration or stepwise addition of ferrate was suggested to play a positive role in IBP photodegradation. Thirteen transformation products were identified and five of them were newly reported. The degradation pathways including hydroxylation, the benzene ring opening and the oxidation of carbon were proposed. IBP can be efficiently removed when spiked in wastewater and seawater despite the decreased degradation rate by 41% and 56%, respectively. Compared to the IBP removal, mineralization was relatively lower. The adverse effect of the parent compound IBP to the green algae Chlorella vulgaris was gradually eliminated with the decomposition of IBP. The transformation product C178a which possibly posed toxicity to rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus can also be efficiently removed, indicating that the photocatalysis process is effective in IBP removal, mineralization and toxicity elimination.

AB Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) filtration is a common process for advanced wastewater treatment. In such filters, the removal of organic substances results from adsorptive as well as biological processes. This work investigated the potential of biological processes and their influence on GAC-filter performance. During 32 months, the removal of micropollutants,Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and the spectral absorption coefficient was monitored in six GAC-filters. The effects of pre-treatment (cloth- and/or membrane-filtration), EBCT (from 6 - 35 min) and GAC-type were evaluated. Likewise, the impact of the influent's fluctuations in temperature, flow and concentration (ammonia, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus (sRP)) were analysed. Biological processes were tracked by the frequency of backwashing, oxygen consumption, removal of poorly absorbable micropollutants and production of transformation products. Pre-treatment influenced biofilm growth significantly. Membrane filtration delayed the first backwashing event by 122 d in comparison to cloth-filtration, where the first backwash was conducted after only 21 d. Removal of poorly absorbable substances was observed early on (40 - 50 d). Parallel operation contributed to a better utilisation of the GAC-capacity and the biological removal potential. Influent nitrogen species > 0.5 mg N/L promoted biofilm growth, whereas sRP seemed to have no effect. The developed biofilm and optimal operating conditions led to longer life spans of the GAC-filters, making carbon usage rates comparable to those from PAC applications. The results suggest that biological processes accounted for about 25 - 42% of the totally removed DOC at the end of the operation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of certain pharmaceutical compounds in ground and surface waters may constitute a serious environmental problem, even at low concentrations. The removal of these compounds is a trending research topic that implies a wide variety of disciplines. To provide clear insight into this field of research, a Systematic Mapping Study review (SMS) has been conducted. We investigated studies reported from 1993 to 2019 in ScienceDirect library. 4164 articles have been analyzed resulting in 172 primary relevant studies and revealing the treatment of 174 molecules. This paper aims to review the existing and recent trends in techniques for the removal of pharmaceuticals present in varied aqueous matrices and also presents a brief overview of the different classes of pharmaceutical compounds investigated. Findings of this study can help the scientists to identify potential techniques aiming to reduce the impact of pharmaceuticals present in wastewater discharge and into surface water bodies. It was revealed that, antibiotics and analgesics/anti-inflammatories are the most commonly investigated, since the highest risk is posed by these classes. The biological processes were found to be the most commonly used techniques in these field of research, and the diclofenac is the most extensively compounds examined. Recent advances in the field of the combination of AOPs with biological water treatment processes for the degradation of pharmaceuticals are discussed. Finally, advantage and limitations of methods used for the elimination of target compounds are addressed.

AB Due to the mass production and the use of antibiotic drugs, the pollution of antibiotics in the environment is aggravated. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), a kind of photocatalyst, can effectively degrade organics from the water environment. However, agglomeration and low catalytic activity sites are crucial to impeding the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2 nanoparticles. The aim of this study is to develop a MoS2 composite with a higher hydrophily and excellent photocatalytic. In this study, a series of CoS2/MoS2@Zeolite photocatalysts (CoS2/MoS2@Z) with high hydrophily, adsorption capacity and photocatalytic were successfully synthesized by the combination of ultrasonic and facile hydrothermal method to solve these problems. The structure characteristics, photocatalytic efficiency, and photocatalytic degradation mechanism were systematically investigated. It was found that zeolite significantly improved the tetracycline (TC) adsorption by CoS2/MoS2@Z-50, which was conducive to the contact between TC and photocatalyst, and could further improve photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic experiment results showed that CoS2/MoS2 @Z-50 had the best removal effect on TC (96.71%) compared with other samples. The increase of photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the high active sites, separation and transfer of electrons and holes in heterojunction. Besides, the CoS2/MoS2@Z-50 maintained a good stability after five cycles of TC photodegradation. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of CoS2/MoS2@Z-50 was proposed. Synthesis of zeolite-based CoS2/MoS2 heterojunction photocatalyst paves the way for TC photodegradation, which may become an efficient, environmentally friendly and a promising photocatalyst in the field of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Widespread disposal of landfill leachate to municipal sewer infrastructure in the United States calls for an improved understanding of the relative organic-chemical contributions to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) waste stream and associated surface-water discharge to receptors in the environment. Landfill leachate, WWTP influent, and WWTP effluent samples were collected from three landfill-WWTP systems and compared with analogous influent and effluent samples from two WWTPs that did not receive leachate. Samples were analyzed for 73 per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 109 pharmaceuticals, and 21 hormones and related compounds. PFAS were detected more frequently in leachate (92%) than in influent (55%). Total PFAS concentrations in leachate (93 100 ng L-1) were more than 10 times higher than in influent (6950 ng L-1) and effluent samples (3730 ng L-1). Concentrations of bisphenol A; the nonprescription pharmaceuticals cotinine, lidocaine, nicotine; and the prescription pharmaceuticals amphetamine, carisoprodol, pentoxifylline, and thiabendazole were an order of magnitude higher in landfill leachate than WWTP influent. Leachate load contributions for PFAS (0.78 to 31 g d(-1)), bisphenol A (0.97 to 8.3 g d(-1)), and nonprescription (2.0 to 3.1 g d(-1)) and prescription (0.48 to 2.5 g d(-1)) pharmaceuticals to WWTP influent were generally low (<10 g d(-1)) for most compounds resulting from high influent-to-leachate volumetric ratios (0.983). No clear differences in concentrations were apparent between effluents from WWTPs receiving landfill leachate and those that did not receive landfill leachate.

AB Diosgenin is an important raw material for the synthesis of steroid hormone drug and largely required in the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, a novel process for biorefinery of Dioscorea composite Hemsl (DCH) with ferric chloride was developed to investigate the conversion of saponins to diosgenin. Furthermore, the waste, including sugary wastewater and starch residue, as recyclable biomass resources after diosgenin extraction was devoted to biomethane. Consequently, the highest yield of diosgenin (3.02%) was obtained using ethanol/ water/petroleum ether (15/16/20, v/v/v) with a total volume of 255 mL containing 80 mL 5.0 g/L ferric chloride aqueous solution at 150 degrees C for 2 h. The yield extracted with FeCl3 was 16.6% higher than the traditional sulfuric acid hydrolysis method and was even 2.3 times more than the biphasic sulfuric acid hydrolysis method. Similarly, without consuming sulfuric acid, the yield was 79.76% higher than the control method. After fermentation, a maximum biomethane yield of 310.5 mL/g COD (chemical oxygen demand) was achieved from wastewater and the decomposition efficiency reached 91.1% with an initial COD concentration of 10,800 mg/L decreasing to 960 mg/L. The final biomethane productivity of waste residues was 278.8 mL/g VS and the VS degradation efficiency was 95.8% after a week. Therefore, the novel method with FeCl3 -catalyzed acidolysis to produce diosgenin and biomethane may be an alternative much cleaner approach to better utilize dioscorea resources.

AB The removal of four dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions, non-acid hydrophobics, hydrophobic adds, hydrophilics and transphilics, was achieved by coagulation-UV/H2O2 oxidation in post-pharmaceutical wastewater (PhWW). Coagulation with Polyfenic chloride (PFC), Polymeric ferric sulfate (PFS) and Polymeric aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) was studied separately to evaluate the effects of the initial pH and coagulant dosage. The coagulation-UV/H2O2 oxidation method resulted in much higher reduction rates for dissolved organic carbon (Doc) (by 75%) and UV254 (by 92%) than coagulation or UV/H2O2 oxidation alone. The proportion of non-acid hydrophobics, hydrophobic adds, transphilics and hydrophilics removed by coagulation was 54%, 49%, 27% and 12 %, while the combined treatment removed 92%, 87%, 70% and 39%, respectively. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence measurements revealed that the humic-like fluorescent component C4 showed the highest removal (by 44%) during the coagulation stage. After coagulation-UV/H2O2 treatment, the humic-like fluorescent component C3 had the highest removal (by 72%), whereas xenobiotic organic fluorescent components C1 and C4 remained recalcitrant to decomposition. Significant correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between Cl and the hydrophobic adds and non-acid hydrophobics suggested the possibility of using fluorescence spectroscopy as an effective tool to assess variations in DOM fraction treatment efficacy in coagulation-UV/H2O2 systems. After the combined treatment, toxic inhibition of cellular activity by post PhWW decreased from 88% to 47% and biodegradability increased from 0.1 to 0.52.

AB Regeneration of wastewater treatment plant effluents constitutes a solution to increase the availability of water resources in arid regions. Water reuse legislation imposes an exhaustive control of the microbiological quality of water in the operation of disinfection tertiary treatments. Additionally, recent reports have paid increasing attention to emerging micropollutants with potential biological effects even at trace level concentration. This work focuses on the evaluation of several photochemical technologies as disinfection processes with the aim of simultaneously achieving bacterial inactivation and oxidation of pharmaceuticals as examples of emerging micropollutants typically present in water and widely studied in the literature. UV-C-based processes show a high efficiency to inactivate bacteria. However, the bacterial damages are reversible and only when using H2O2, bacterial reproduction is affected. Moreover, a complete elimination of pharmaceutical compounds was not achieved at the end of the inactivation process. In contrast, UV-A/TiO2 required a longer irradiation time to inactivate bacteria but pharmaceuticals were completely removed along the process. In addition, its oxidation mechanism, based on hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), leads to irreversible bacterial damages, not requiring of chemicals to avoid bacterial regrowth. For UV-A/TiO2/H2O2 process, the addition of H2O2 improved Escherichia coli inactivation since the cell wall weakening, due to (OH)-O-center dot attacks, allowed H2O2 to diffuse into the bacteria. However, a total elimination of the pharmaceuticals was not achieved during the inactivation process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study addressed the formation and properties of degradation products of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and lomefloxacin formed during ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent containing these fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The generation of the degradation products was interpreted in the context of transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) tracked via absorbance measurements. The structures of 20 degradation products were elucidated for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. 27 degradation products were identified for lomefloxacin. The prevalent oxidation pathways were suggested based on the structures of the identified products formed in the absence and presence of the hydroxyl radical scavenger t-butanol. These pathways were largely similar for all studied fluoroquinolones and involved attacks on the piperazine ring and the quinolone structure. The quinolone ring remained intact in the presence of t-butanol thus indicating that this functional group could only be oxidized by OH radicals while the piperazine ring was readily oxidized by molecular ozone. The cleavage of the quinolone moiety that resulted in several identified degradation products occurred via the attack by hydroxyl radicals on the carbon carbon double bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Lomefloxacin had more diverse oxidation products due to the presence of a methyl group on its piperazinyl ring. The concentrations of the identified degradation products behaved non-monotonically as a function of ozone dose or treatment time, yet exhibited interpretable correlations versus changes of EfOM absorbance. Examination of these correlations allowed developing a novel approach for elucidating the transformations of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during ozonation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of effluent organic matter (EfOM) characteristics on the removal of bulk organic matter (OM) and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR) treatment processes. The fate of bulk OM and PhACs during an MAR is important to assess post-treatment requirements. Biodegradable OM from EfOM, originating from biological wastewater treatment, was effectively removed during soil passage. Based on a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (F-EEM) analysis of wastewater effluent-dominated (WWE-dom) surface water (SW), protein-like substances, i.e., biopolymers, were removed more favorably than fluorescent humic-like substances under oxic compared to anoxic conditions. However, there was no preferential removal of biopolymers or humic substances, determined as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) observed via liquid chromatography with online organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analysis. Most of the selected PhACs exhibited removal efficiencies of greater than 90% in both SW and WWE-dom SW. However, the removal efficiencies of bezafibrate, diclofenac and gemfibrozil were relatively low in WWE-dom SW, which contained more biodegradable OM than did SW (copiotrophic metabolism). Based on this study, low biodegradable fractions such as humic substances in MR may have enhanced the degradation of diclofenac, gemfibrozil and bezafibrate by inducing an oligotrophic microbial community via long term starvation. Both carbamazepine and clofibric acid showed persistent behaviors and were not influenced by EfOM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics used during animal production are the same or very similar to antibiotics used by humans. Tylosin, structurally similar to erythromycin prescribed to humans, is a common livestock antibiotic. Therefore, tylosin and other similar antibiotics present a potential threat of environmental buildup resulting in increased microbial resistance. To mitigate this potential impact, a remediation method for reducing the load of antimicrobials entering the environment is needed. The binding properties of different types of diatomaceous earth (DE) were investigated for maximum binding and the influencing physical characteristics to determine the potential use as a binding agent for wastewater treatment. Swimming pool DE was 99% crystalline silica and did not sorb any tylosin. Raw DE was 65% amorphous silica, 20% clay, and had 3% organic matter by weight. Langmuir isotherms predicted a maximum binding capacity of 49 +/- 3 mg g(-1) with a binding constant of 37,342 +/- 5653 M-1. This was almost 3.3 times more than previously published work investigating the binding of tylosin to kieselguhr that is 96% amorphous silica with little to no clays or organic matter present. To determine the role of organic matter and clays in binding capacity, raw DE was digested with 3% hydrogen peroxide and adsorption isotherms were constructed. After removal of the organic matter, predicted maximum binding of tylosin increased to 88 +/- 2 mg g(-1), whereas the binding constant slightly decreased (23,482 +/- 3264 M-1). It was concluded that the DE-clay matrix was responsible for high binding and therefore had the greatest potential for application in a wastewater treatment process.

AB This study investigated the degradation of three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX)) by UV/persulfate (UV/PS) in pure water and the influence of wastewater on UV/PS performance. Three NSAIDs have no obvious removal in the PS system, while they all showed a decrease in the UV system, and DCF showed the most significant decrease among the three NSAIDs in the UV system. The degradation of NSAIDs in UV/PS system followed the pseudo first-order degradation kinetics, and the kinetic constants orders are: k(DCF) > k(NPX) > k(IBP). SO4-center dot contributes more than center dot OH in NSAIDs degradation according to tertiary butanol and methanol inhibition tests. According to the degradation products detected by LC-MS, hydroxylation and decarboxylation are main pathways in NSAIDs degradation, and dechlorination is also a main path in DCF degradation. When UV/PS was used to dispose effluents spiked with NSAIDs solution (DCF, NPX, IBP, 0.1 mu M each), 10 times of PS dosage and 6 times treatment time were needed to get the same removal in pure water. The water quality parameters (i.e., natural organic matter (NOM), HCO3-, Cl- and NO3-) affects the degradation of NSAIDs by UV/PS. The degradation efficiency of NSAIDs was inhibited in the presence of humic acid and HCO3-. Meanwhile, Cl- and NO3- barely influenced the degradation efficiency.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compound residues in water bodies is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Various pharmaceuticals have been detected in raw municipal wastewaters, after wastewater treatment plant processes, and even in drinking water. Many common pharmaceuticals are bio-accumulating and they can have a harmful impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   In this work, pulsed corona discharge technology (PCD) is studied as a potential method for antibiotic compounds abatement. Two antibiotics, amoxicillin and doxycycline, were chosen as test pharmaceutical compounds. The aim of the study was to investigate the transformation kinetics of binary solutions (water single antibiotic compound) and ternary solutions (water - two antibiotic compounds) of the compounds and to optimize operational parameters for improved oxidation performance. Ternary solutions were investigated to obtain data on transformation kinetics when two competing pharmaceutical molecules are present in the solution. The experiments showed that reactions of doxycycline oxidation are always first order reactions. Reaction of amoxicillin oxidation has second order in the case of experiments with binary solution in alkaline medium. In other cases, it has first order. The transformation products formed were identified and monitored based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometer analysis. OH-amoxicillin, amoxicillin pencilloic acid, OH-doxycycline and 2-OH-doxycycline had the largest peaks areas. All studied compounds and all transformation products can be easily oxidized by PCD. Approximately 1 kWh/m(3) and 0.5 kWh/m(3) delivered energy is enough for oxidation of great part of amoxicillin and doxycycline respectively. Low frequency, 50 pps, and high (pH = 12) are preferable for oxidation of both antibiotics from the energy consumption point of view.

AB A 16S rRNA gene multiplex 454 pyrosequencing approach was used to characterize the structure of the bacterial community in subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with Typha angustifoha and unplanted wetland mesocosms receiving ibuprofen-enriched wastewater at a concentration of 250 mu g L-1. The removal efficiency of ibuprofen (IBP) in the planted beds (78.5%) was significantly higher than that in the unplanted beds (57.9%) (P <= 0.05). The presence of ibuprofen significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced the diversity of the bacterial community. In total, 20 phyla comprising 265 genera were identified. The most predominant phyla were Firmicutes (27.6%), Actinobacteria (26.0%) and Proteobacteria (24.9%), making up 57-95% of the 16S rDNA sequences. Other dominating phyla in wetland soils were Chloroflexi (7.3%), Bacteroidetes (2.7%), Synergistetes (2.1%), and Acidobacteria (2.0%). A distinct profile of bacterial community in the wetland mesocosms was observed after IBP enrichment. IBP-enrichment enhanced the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacilli and gamma-Proteobacteria at class level. The efficient ibuprofen removal observed in this study suggested that the IBP-enriched wetland systems may have selected a restricted group of bacteria that was able to survive best in the disturbed condition and participate in the IBP biodegradation. Our findings also indicated that the presence of macrophytes may have a vital impact on the microbial community and planted wetlands may be more robust and buffered against significant shifts in microbial composition in response to IBP-disturbance.

AB The electrochemical degradation of six of the most widely used iodinated contrast media was investigated. Batch experiments were performed under constant current conditions using two DSA (R) electrodes (titanium coated with a proprietary and patented mixed metal oxide solution of precious metals such as iridium, ruthenium, platinum, rhodium and tantalum). The degradation removal never fell below 85% (at a current density of 64 mA/cm(2) with a reaction time of 150 min) when perchlorate was used as the supporting electrolyte; however, when sulphate was used, the degradation performance was above 80% (at a current density of 64 mA/cm(2) with a reaction time of 150 min) for all of the compounds studied. Three main degradation pathways were identified, namely, the reductive de-iodination of the aromatic ring, the reduction of alkyl aromatic amides to simple amides and the de-acylation of N-aromatic amides to produce aromatic amines. However, as amidotrizoate is an aromatic carboxylate, this is added via the decarboxylation reaction. The investigation did not reveal toxicity except for the lower current density used, which has shown a modest toxicity, most likely for some reaction intermediates that are not further degraded. In order to obtain total removal of the contrast media, it was necessary to employ a current intensity between 118 and 182 mA/cm(2) with energy consumption higher than 370 kWh/m(3). Overall, the electrochemical degradation was revealed to be a reliable process for the treatment of iodinated contrast media that can be found in contaminated waters such as hospital wastewater or pharmaceutical waste-contaminated streams.

AB The capacity of a hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system consisting of two vertical flow (VF) CWs working alternatively (3 m(2)), one horizontal flow (HF) CW (2 m(2)) and one surface flow (FWS) CW (2 m(2)) in series to eliminate 13 emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) under three different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) (0.06, 0.13 and 0.18 m d(-1) considering the area of the two VF beds) was studied through a continuous injection experiment General toxicity, dioxin-like activity, antimicrobial activity and estrogenicity were also measured under the highest hydraulic loading rate. The hybrid system was highly efficient on the removal of total injected EOCs (except for antibiotics, 43 +/- 32%) at all three HLRs (87 +/- 10%). The removal efficiency in the hybrid CW system showed to decrease as the HLR increased for most compounds. The VF wetlands removed most of the injected EOCs more efficiently than the other two CWs, which was attributable to the predominant aerobic degradation pathways of the VF beds (70 +/- 21%). General toxicity was reduced up to 90% by the VF beds. Estrogenicity and dioxin-like activity were similarly reduced by the VF and the HF wetlands, whereas antimicrobial activity was mainly removed by the FWS wetland. Bearing this in mind, this injection study has demonstrated that the use of hybrid CW systems is a suitable wastewater technology for removing EOCs and toxicity even at high HLRs.

AB Emerging contaminants such as Mitoxantrone (MTX) are a major environmental concern because they have potential genotoxicity and mutagenesis to both aquatic organisms and humans. In this study, a pre-adsorption/ Fenton-like oxidation system was developed which used a reduced graphene oxide/iron nanoparticles hybrid (rGO/Fe NPs) as both the adsorbent and the Fenton catalyst to remove MTX from solution. While the addition of H2O2 alone removed only 11.3% of MTX, the rGO/Fe NPs/H2O2 system was significantly more efficient removing 99.8% of MTX in the same period. This indicated that rGO/Fe NPs had excellent catalytic activity even at pH 7. This efficient removal was attributed to significant production of (OH)-O-center dot mainly by heterogeneous catalysis but supplemented by a homogeneous Fenton reaction, where center dot OH had a higher affinity for MTX than SO4-center dot. The sequential Fenton-like oxidation process best fits a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2 >= 0.974). Characterizations of rGO/Fe NPs before and after the reaction, together with the identification of specific MTX degradation products, allowed possible degradation pathways to be proposed together with insights into the underlying mechanisms of MTX degradation when using rGO/Fe NPs in a pre-adsorption/Fenton-like oxidation system. Finally, the rGO/Fe NPs developed was successfully applied for the removal of MTX from spiked wastewater with 93.6% removal efficiency, which indicated that the proposed system had significant potential for wastewater treatment applications.

AB Purpose Pharmaceutical contaminants, including antibiotics, present in the environment, especially water resources, are a main concern for human and environmental health due to their stability and non-degradability. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the photocatalytic removal of penicillin G antibiotic from simulated wastewater using a photocatalytic process [UV/ZnO] in an isotherm and kinetic study. Methods In the current research, the ZnO nanoparticles [ZnO NPs] were initially characterized by scanning electron microscope [SEM] and X-ray diffraction [XRD]. Then, its efficiency was investigated in the photocatalytic degradation process of penicillin G. The evaluated parameters in the adsorption process penicillin G antibiotic were pH [1-5], penicillin G concentration [10-30 mgL(-1)], NP dosage [0.5-4.5 gL(-1)] and contact time [5 to 200 min]. Then, the effect of pH [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and], penicillin G concentration [10-30 mgL(-1)], NP dosage [0.01-1.5 gL(-1)] and contact time [5 to 200 min] in the photocatalytic degradation (UV/ZnO) was studied. The residual penicillin G concentration was measured using a spectrophotometery at a wavelength of 283 nm. Results The results indicated that the penicillin G removal efficiency of photocatalytic process [UV/ZnO] using ZnO was 74.65% at the concentration of 10 mgL(-1), the pH value of 5, the ZnO NP dosage of 0.1 gL(-1) and the contact time of 180 min, as well as the kinetics of degradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Conclusion It can be concluded that the use of this process is appropriate an effective for the removal of the antibiotic pollutants.

AB This research aimed at studying the degradation of benzotriazole (BT), an abundant contaminant in many natural waters, using catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation processes performed in a semi-continuous reactor. Magnetic alumina nanocomposite (MANC) was successfully synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM). The results revealed that the MANC dramatically enhanced the removal rate of BT. Experiments were evaluated at different solution pH values, catalyst doses, initial benzotriazole concentrations, and oxygen gas flow rates. The results showed that the removal rate of BT strongly influenced by the initial pH, and it increased by enhancing the pH value from 2 to 10 in both catalytic and non-catalytic ozonation. However, the catalyst showed its highest activity at pH near to its point of zero charge, indicating the critical importance of surface hydroxyl groups of alumina. Introducing tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) to the reactor highly decreased the degradation efficiency in the non-catalytic ozonation process, suggesting that the MANC catalyzes the decomposition of ozone to hydroxyl radical. The catalyst stability experiments after four successive runs showed that the catalyst was efficient and stable. Finally, the degradation of BT in secondary municipal wastewater effluent was studied under optimum operating conditions in order to examine the performance of the catalyst in the presence of components available in real streams. The results indicated no significant decrease in the performance of the catalyst. Furthermore, the catalytic ozonation process had also a great performance for removing phosphorus.

AB Active pharmaceutical compounds reach the wastewater treatment plants mainly through excretion and improper disposal, and, because of insufficient treating methods, they end up to surface water or even potable water in some cases. Atenolol and metoprolol are beta-blockers, members of cardiovascular pharmaceuticals group. They are generally used in the treatment of disorders such as hypertension, angina and arrhythmias. They have been in long-term use in Europe and North America, and they have also been detected in the aquatic environment.
   In this study the degradation of atenolol and metoprolol in aqueous solutions by means of the photo-Fenton reaction was investigated. The purpose of this study was: (i) to investigate the influence of the concentrations of iron and hydrogen peroxide, by means of central composite design, (ii) to study the degradation kinetics in aqueous solutions, (iii) to evaluate the mineralization and the toxicity evolution of the target compounds and (iv) to identify the degradation products.
   It has been found that increase of iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration accelerate the degradation of atenolol and metoprolol, while the kinetics of the process can be characterized as pseudo-first order. In general the photo-Fenton method has proved to be effective in decomposing and mineralizing the target compounds. The determination of the by-products formed during the degradation using LC-MS/MS equipment and the evaluation of the toxicity of the treated solution in different stages of the process would offer significant, innovative information regarding the treatment of water and wastewater containing active pharmaceutical compounds, especially of the beta-blocker group.

AB The removal efficiency of 16 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater (dissolved and particulate phases) was evaluated for the first time in a hybrid pilot plant consisting of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor followed by two sequentially connected horizontal flow constructed wetlands: a surface flow wetland (SF CW) and a subsurface flow wetland (SSF CW). Whereas the PPCP removal associated with the dissolved phase exhibited a seasonal pattern, the fraction associated with the suspended solids showed less seasonality. In the dissolved phase, the overall removal efficiency in summer ranged from 70% to 85% for salicylic acid (SAL), methyl dihydrojasmonate, caffeine (CAF), ketoprofen and triclosan, whereas in winter it declined for most of the PPCPs to between 30% and 50%, except for CAF and SAL (>80%) and carbamazepine and butylated hydroxyl toluene (11-18%). In the suspended solids, the removal exceeded 80% for most of the target PPCPs. The efficiency of the different treatment steps was also compound-dependent, but the SF CW generally exhibited the highest removal efficiency for most of the contaminants analyzed. The characterization of the organic matter retained in the wetland gravel beds revealed the occurrence of hydrophobic contaminants such as phthalate esters and fragrances at moderate concentrations (i.e., up to 3.5 mu g kg(-1)), which declined strongly over the course of the different treatment steps. In the SF CW, the net mass accumulation rates of tonalide and galaxolide were 4 and 23 g y(-1) respectively, whereas in the SSF CW they were 0.3 and 1.8 g y(-1) respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bench-scale, semibatch experiments were performed to examine physical-chemical constraints on ozone (O-3) absorption and micropollutant oxidation during ozonation of source-separated hydrolyzed urine and the concentrate and diluate streams produced via electrodialysis of hydrolyzed urine. O-3 consumption by each matrix was found to occur within a fast pseudo-first-order kinetic regime, Critical constraints on micropollutant oxidation were found through mass transfer modeling to be (i) micropollutant diffusion from the bulk solution into the gas-liquid interfacial film for compounds recalcitrant toward O-3 (i.e., k(03,app)'' <= 10(3) M-1 s(-1)), and (ii) aqueous-phase mixing for compounds highly reactive toward O-3 (i.e., k(03,app)'' > 10(3) M-1 s(-1)), Homogeneous chemical reaction modeling indicated that aqueous reaction chemistry is significantly influenced by the degree to which incidentally produced hydroxyl radicals are consumed by NH3 in each matrix, in terms of (a) micropollutant oxidation efficiencies, and (b) potential yields of oxidation byproducts. On the basis of the experimental data reported here, per capita energy requirements were estimated for treatment of source-separated urine via (1) ozonation, (2) ozonation with postelectrodialysis, and (3) electrodialysis with postozonation. These estimates indicate that scenario (1) would likely be less energy efficient than ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent in achieving equivalent reductions in urine-derived micropollutant loads, whereas scenarios (2 and 3) could be more efficient than equivalent centralized wastewater treatment strategies in achieving equivalent levels of urine-derived nutrient and micropollutant attenuation. Furthermore, experimental and model data suggest that urine ozonation efficiency maybe substantially improved by optimizing aqueous-phase mixing and specific gas-liquid interfacial area.

AB An integrated cobalt oxide catalyst supported on silica (Co3O4/SiO2) packed in the lumen of tubular alumina (Al2O3) membrane was designed to realize a Fenton-like oxidation coupling with ultrafiltration water treatment technology to remove persistent and hazardous pollutants. We employed a selection of SiO2 support materials with a range micro/mesostructures to immobilize the Co3O4 catalyst. These were evaluated and screened to achieve the highest pollutant decolorization rate and maximum decolorization efficiency. Then, an integrated catalyst-membrane was developed as proof-of-concept for advanced water treatment. Batch degradation results showed acid orange 7 dye (AO7) was effectively removed using Co3O4 deposited on MCM-41 silica, with 97% decolorization efficiency achieved in 15 mins owing to the large surface area and high porosity of the MCM-41 support. In contrast, humic acid (HA) was relatively difficult to degrade using this catalyst, and was however found to inhibit AO7 degradation. The integrated catalyst-membrane successfully removed both AO7 and HA with only a 10% water flux reduction from 25.0 to 22.5 kg m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) with excellent co-pollutant removal rate of 99% over 40 h. Furthermore, the integrated catalyst-membrane also removed a range of organic pollutants (neutral red, tetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline) achieving > 90% rejection and 30 kg m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1). These results show that the integrated catalyst-membrane can effectively purify a binary pollutant mixture containing both hazardous dye and natural organic matter and other pharmaceutical chemicals whilst producing process water for recycling and reuse.

AB Gemifloxacin (GEM) is a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic. The presence of GEM residuals in industrial and hospital wastewater has been associated with genotoxicity and antibiotic resistance. In this contribution, the photodegradation of GEM using titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs)/H2O2 as a catalyst was optimized to eliminate residual drug and its photodegradates with antibacterial activity. A half-factorial design was implemented, investigating the effects of pH, initial concentration, H2O2 concentration, TiO2NP loading, and irradiation time. Owing to the time-dependent, multi-transformation of GEM into a wide range of structurally related photodegradation products, the monitoring of GEM throughout the experiments was achieved using both HPLC and potentiometric ion-selective electrodes (ISE). The sensor enabled in-line tracking of residual GEM in the presence of its photodegradates in real time. Results indicated that the pH, irradiation time, and GEM initial concentration were the most significant factors. At the optimum set of experimental conditions, the reaction followed first-order reaction kinetics with a mean percentage degradation of similar to 95% in less than 30 min of irradiation time and almost complete loss of antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The promising results demonstrated the efficiency of UV/TiO2NP/H2O2 as a photocatalyst for the breakdown of the pharmacophore of fluoroquinolones from water samples. The high selectivity, minimal solvent consumption, and lack of harmful waste generation confirmed the superiority of in-line monitoring using ISE. Optimization and in-line monitoring protocol should be applicable also at the pharmaceutical industry scale to eliminate the risk of antibiotic resistance.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1-3) and other genetic elements as antiseptic resistance gene (qacE Delta 1) and class 1 and class 2 integrons (int1-2) in the upper layer of substrate and in the effluent of microcosm constructed wetlands (CWs) treating artificial wastewater containing diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The bacteria in the substrate and in the effluents were equipped with the sul1-2, int1, and qacE Delta 1 resistance determinants, which were introduced into the CW system during inoculation with activated sludge and with the soil attached to the rhizosphere of potted seedlings of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta' roots (int1). By comparing the occurrence of the resistance determinants in the upper substrate layer and the effluent, it can be stated that they neither were lost nor emerged along the flow path. The implications of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the effluent may entail a risk of antibiotic resistance being spread in the receiving environment. Additionally, transformation products of SMX were determined. According to the obtained results, four (potential) SMX transformation products were identified. Two major metabolites of SMX, 2,3,5-trihydroxy-SMX and 3,5-dihydroxy-SMX, indicated that SMX may be partly oxidized during the treatment. The remaining two SMX transformation products (hydroxy-glutathionyl-SMX and glutathionyl-SMX) are conjugates with glutathione, which suggests the ability of CW bacterial community to degrade SMX and resist antimicrobial stress.

AB Landfill leachate samples (n = 11) were collected from five USA municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and analyzed for ten trace organic pollutants that are commonly detected in surface and municipal wastewater effluents (viz., carbamazepine, DEET, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, PFOA, PFOS, primidone, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim). Carbamazepine, DEET, PFOA and primidone were detected in all leachate samples analyzed and gemfibrozil was detected in samples from four of the five-landfill sites. The contaminants found in the highest concentrations were DEET (6900-143 000 ng L-1) and sucralose (<10-621 000 ng L-1). Several compounds were not detected (fluoxetine) or detected infrequently (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and PFOS). Using the average mass of DEET in leachate amongst the five landfills and scaling the mass release from the five test landfills to the USA population of landfills, an order of magnitude estimate is that over 10 000 kg DEET yr(-1) may be released in leachate. Some pharmaceuticals have similar annual mean discharges to one another, with the estimated annual discharge of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, primidone equating to 53, 151 and 128 kg year(-1). To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that primidone has been included in a landfill leachate study. While the estimates developed in this study are order of magnitude, the values do suggest the need for further research to better quantify the amount of chemicals sent to wastewater treatment facilities with landfill leachate, potential impacts on treatment processes and the significance of landfill leachate as a source of surface water contamination.

AB The competitive impacts of different fractions of wastewater treatment plant effluent organic matter (EfOM) on organic micro-pollutant (OMP) adsorption were investigated. The fractionation was accomplished using separation by nanofiltration (NF). The waters resulting from NF were additionally treated to obtain the same dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations as the initial water. Using size exclusion chromatography (LC-OCD) it could be shown that the NF treatment resulted in an EfOM separation by size. Adsorption tests showed different competitive effects of the EfOM fractions with the OMP. While large EfOM compounds that were retained in NF demonstrated a reduced competition as compared to the raw water, the NF-permeating EfOM compounds showed an increased competition with the majority of the measured OMP. The effects of small size EfOM are particularly negative for OMP which are weak/moderate adsorbates. Adsorption analysis was carried out for the differently fractionized waters. The small sized EfOM contain better adsorbable compounds than the raw water while the large EfOM are less adsorbable. This explains the observed differences in the EfOM competitiveness. The equivalent background compound (EBC) model was applied to model competitive adsorption between OMP and EfOM and showed that the negative impacts of EfOM on OMP adsorption increase with decreasing size of the EfOM fractions. The results suggest that direct competition for adsorption sites on the internal surface of the activated carbon is more substantial than indirect competition due to pore access restriction by blockage. Another explication for reduced competition by large EfOM compounds could be the inability to enter and block the pores due to size exclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Triclosan, a widely used antimicrobial, is known to undergo phototransformation in aqueous solution to form 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD). Two sediment cores from a wastewater-impacted depositional zone of the Mississippi River were analyzed for triclosan by ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-Q(3)) and for a suite of polychlorinated dioxins and furans by high resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) to provide evidence of this photoreaction in the environment 2,8-DCDD was detected at levels that trended with the historical use of triclosan since its introduction in the 1960s. Three other dioxin congeners, 2,3,7-TCDD, 1,2,8-TriCDD, and 1,2,3,8-TCDD, which are known photoproducts of chlorinated derivatives of triclosan, were also detected with similar trend profiles. These four congeners comprised the majority of di- through tetra-chlorinated dioxins. The trend profile of these specific dioxin congeners did not correlate with the trend profile of the higher-chlorinated dioxin homologues or any chlorinated furan homologues, suggesting a unique source. These results are fully consistent with the phototransformation of triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives that form during wastewater chlorine disinfection as the source of 2,8-DCDD, 2,3,7-TriCDD, 1,2,8-TriCDD, and 1,2,3,8-TCDD in this aquatic environment As the levels of triclosan-derived dioxins increased over time and the total level of chlorinated dioxins decreased, the contribution of triclosan-derived dioxins to the total dioxin pool increased to as high as 31% by mass in recent years, indicating that their contribution to total dioxin toxicity may need consideration.

AB BACKGROUND Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and recalcitrant fluorine pharmaceutical that is poorly biodegraded, so it enters the hydric resources and causes hazardous effects to aquatic environments. According to these fluoxetine features, the main aim of the present research was to find resistant bacteria in environmental samples with a high degradation efficiency. RESULTS The results obtained from raw municipal wastewater spiked with fluoxetine and inoculated with aerobic sludge from a Portuguese wastewater treatment plant under highly aerobic conditions showed that more than half and approximate to 89% of the drug was degraded after 48 and 144 h, respectively. During the assay, the initial population (mainly composed of Arcobacter, Bacteroides, and Macellibacteroides) shifted with an increase of members of the Acinetobacter, Rheinheimera, Shewanella, Pseudomonas, Methylobacillus, Piscinobacter genera and Aeromonadales order and the Pseudomonadaceae family, all of which were likely responsible for fluoxetine biodegradation. From the same sludge, six bacterial isolates were selected and identified as follows: Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter ludwigii, Pseudomonas nitritireducens, Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas nitroreducens; all of them grew with fluoxetine as sole carbon source. Pseudomonas nitroreducens showed the highest removal of 55 +/- 1% at 20 mg L-1 fluoxetine after 24 h. CONCLUSION An autochthonous aerobic bacterial community and its cultivable isolates showed the capacity to biodegrade fluoxetine. Biodegradation, rather than adsorption, appears to play the main role in the fluoxetine removal in aerobic conditions using bacteria simply obtained from an environmental sample. As far as is known, those bacteria are reported for the first time as fluoxetine biodegraders; thus, these bacteria are a promising option to integrate into new bioremediation processes aiming at the removal of fluoxetine.

AB Experimental and computational investigations have been conducted in this study to assess the influence of municipal waste pyrolyzed biochar impregnated clay composites on antibiotic removal as a material for wastewater treatment and simultaneous value-addition for waste. The surface potential (zeta potential) of the pristine biochar and composite samples are found to be within the range similar to 10 to similar to -40 mV in the pH range 2-10. The presence of different inorganic salt solutions influences the electrophoretic mobility of the dispersed phase in a suspension, as well as its zeta potential. In addition of Na+ salt solutions, the Na+ ions undergo electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged biochar samples and form a double layer at the interface of biochar and ionic salt solution. Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to understand experimental findings, ions adsorption and solute-solvent interactions at the molecular level of two biochar B7 (seven benzene rings, one methoxy, one aldehyde and two hydroxyls groups) and B17 (seventeen benzene rings, one methoxy, two hydroxyls and two carboxylic acid groups) in salts aqueous solutions. The results confirm that hydroxyls and carboxylate groups of biochar are responsible for solute-solvent interactions. Successful removal of tetracycline antibiotics is observed with 26 mg/g maximum adsorption capacity with montmorillonite biochar composite. This study confirms that interactions between amide and hydroxyl groups of tetracycline with hydroxyl and carboxylate groups of biochar play the key role in the adsorption process. The solution pH and presence of different background electrolytes effectively influence the process of solute-solvent interactions as well as adsorption efficacy towards tetracycline adsorption.

AB This work evaluated the formation of transformation products (TPs) during the degradation of diazepam (DZP) by a solar photo-Fenton process. Six TPs were identified, three of them for the first time. After elucidation of the TPs, a new, cheap, fast, and easy method was employed to extract and preconcentrate DZP and its TPs, using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). The method was optimized us ing factorial and Doehlert designs, with the best results obtained using acetonitrile as disperser solvent and chloroform as extraction solvent, with volumes of 1000 and 650 mu L, respectively. When DZP degradation was performed in ultrapure water, the extraction/preconcentration of DZP and its TPs by DLLME was very similar to the results obtained using a traditional SPE method. However, when hospital wastewater was used as the matrix, more limited extraction efficiency was obtained using DLLME, compared to SPE. Meanwhile, all the TPs extracted by SPE were also extracted by the DLLME technique. Furthermore, DLLME was much less expensive than SPE, besides being faster, easier, and requiring only small amounts of organic solvents. This work reports a new and very important tool for the extraction and preconcentration of TPs formed during degradation using techniques such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), since without this step it would not be possible to identify all the TPs formed in some complex wastewater matrices.

AB A novel self-sustaining monolithic photoelectrocatalytic/photovoltaic (SMPP) system is constructed with a FTO-glass-based WO3/BiVO4 photoanode, which was prepared by coating BiVO(4)on WO3 nanoplate array using simple wet chemical methods, a rear Si photovoltaic cell (PVC) and a counter Pt-black/Pt cathode. The optimum SMPP system shows an efficient and stable degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride with a rate constant 0.75 h(-1) and yields an open circuit voltage 1.35 V, a short circuit current 2900 mu A cm(-2), a power density 1112 mu W cm(-2), which is nearly 14 times that of theultimate conventional photocatalytic fuel cell to date, and a hydrogen generation rate 52.6 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2). This outstanding performance should be due to the efficient electron/hole separation and light exploitation, because, under stimulated sunlight illumination, the front WO3/BiVO4 photoanode absorbs short-wavelength photons and generates electron/hole pairs, in which the photogenerated holes can oxidize organics, while the rear Si PVC captures the transmitting longer-wavelength photons to generate photovoltage that drives photogenerated electrons to the cathode for reducing H+ to H-2 and generating electricity in the external-circuit. The results also demonstrate that various refractory organics can be efficiently decomposed along with the production of electricity and hydrogen by the SMPP system. This work provides a more efficient way to dispose organics and simultaneously produce clean energy than conventional technologies and serves well as a promising technology for wastewater recycling.

AB Aquatic system contamination is a subject of concern due to the high number of contaminants with the potential to be hazardous for plant and animal species, including humans. A large number of analytical methods have been developed to evaluate the extension of water resource pollution, most of them focused on target residue analysis. Screening methods for potential target and non-target compounds are a potential alternative and could be used for a comprehensive evaluation of samples composition. Liquid chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-qTOF-MS/MS) was developed to provide full-spectrum data and high mass resolution with appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for monitoring of 300 pharmaceuticals and pesticides in environmental water samples. The validation was based on anti-doping analysis validation protocols, using three different concentration levels (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mu g L-1). Confirmation analysis was achieved using two fragment ions monitoring for each analyte. Samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by LC-qTOF-MS/MS. The final method was able to detect 170 chemicals in wastewater treatment plant effluent and 198 chemicals in surface water. The advantage of using post-acquisition data processing provided by a qTOF-MS/MS system allowed for non-target analysis for an illicit drug metabolite determination. The method was successfully applied to real samples of wastewater and surface water.

AB Emergence and spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) present a major threat to public health. In this study, we characterized -lactam-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from six wastewater samples obtained from two pharmaceutical industries located in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. Bacteria were isolated by using MacConkey agar; species identification and antibacterial susceptibility testing were performed by Vitek 2. Etest was used for ESBL phenotype confirmation. The presence of -lactamase genes was investigated by PCR and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was done by XbaI-macrorestriction and subsequent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as well as multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Thirty-five bacterial species were isolated from the six samples; among them, we identified seven K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to -lactams and co-resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and folate pathway inhibitors. The ESBL phenotype was confirmed in six K. pneumoniae isolates that harbored ESBL genes bla(CTX-M-15) (n=5), bla(SHV-2) (n=1), and bla(SHV-12) (n=1). PFGE and MLST analysis revealed five clones belonging to four sequence types (ST11, ST15, ST37, ST101), and clone K. pneumoniae-ST101 was present in the wastewater samples from two different pharmaceutical industries. Additionally performed conjugation assays confirmed the location of -lactamase genes on conjugative plasmids. This is the first confirmation of K. pneumoniae isolates producing CTX-M-15-ESBL from pharmaceutical wastewaters in Nigeria. The co-resistance observed might be a reflection of the different drugs produced by these industries. Continuous surveillance of the environmental reservoirs of multidrug-resistant bacteria is necessary to prevent their further spread.

AB The behavior and fate of pharmaceutical ingredients in coastal marine ecosystems are not well understood. To address this, the spatial and temporal distribution of 15 high-volume pharmaceuticals were measured over a 1-yr period in Narragansett Bay (RI, USA) to elucidate factors and processes regulating their concentration and distribution. Dissolved concentrations ranged from below detection to 313 ng/L, with 4 pharmaceuticals present at all sites and sampling periods. Eight pharmaceuticals were present in suspended particulate material, ranging in concentration from below detection to 44 ng/g. Partitioning coefficients were determined for some pharmaceuticals, with their range and variability remaining relatively constant throughout the study. Normalization to organic carbon content provided no benefit, indicating other factors played a greater role in regulating partitioning behavior. Within the upper bay, the continuous influx of wastewater treatment plant effluents resulted in sustained, elevated levels of pharmaceuticals. A pharmaceutical concentration gradient was apparent from this zone to the mouth of the bay. For most of the pharmaceuticals, there was a strong relationship with salinity, indicating conservative behavior within the estuary. Short flushing times in Narragansett Bay coupled with pharmaceuticals' presence overwhelmingly in the dissolved phase indicate that most pharmaceuticals will be diluted and transported out of the estuary, with only trace amounts of several compounds sequestered in sediments. The present study identifies factors controlling the temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved and particulate pharmaceuticals; their partitioning behavior provides an increased understanding of their fate, including bioavailability in an urban estuary.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have raised considerable concern over the past decade due to their widespread detection in water resources and their potential to affect ecosystem health. This triggered many attempts to prioritize the large number of known APIs to target monitoring efforts and testing of fate and effects. However, so far, a comprehensive approach to screen for their presence in surface waters has been missing. Here, we explore a combination of an automated suspect screening approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry and a model-based prioritization using consumption data, readily predictable fate properties and a generic mass balance model for activated sludge treatment to comprehensively detect APIs with relevant exposure in wastewater treatment plant effluents. The procedure afforded the detection of 27 APIs that had not been covered in our previous target method, which included 119 parent APIs. The newly detected APIs included seven compounds with a high potential for bioaccumulation and persistence, and also three compounds that were suspected to stem from point sources rather than from consumption as medicines. Analytical suspect screening proved to be more selective than model-based prioritization, making it the method of choice for focusing analytical method development or fate and effect testing on those APIs most relevant to the aquatic environment. However, we found that state-of-the-practice exposure modeling used to predict potential high-exposure substances can be a useful complement to point toward oversights and known or suspected detection gaps in the analytical method, most of which were related to insufficient ionization.

AB A 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was used to characterize the structures of microbial communities in wetland mesocosms receiving caffeine-enriched wastewater at a concentration of 250 mu g L-1. The removal efficiencies of caffeine in the planted beds (93.0 %) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those in the unplanted beds (81.4 %). Bacterial diversity was decreased by 25 and 22.4 %, respectively, in both planted and unplanted mesocosms after 210-day operation. The results of taxonomic analyses suggested that chronic exposure of wetland ecosystems to caffeine could lead to moderate shifts in microbial community composition. In total, 2156 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated and 20 phyla comprising 260 genera were identified. The major phylogenetic groups at phylum level included Firmicutes (39 %), Actinobacteria (25.1 %), Proteobacteria (17.1 %), Synergistetes (5.6 %), and Chloroflexi (5.5 %). Bacilli and Synergistia increased in abundance in the planted mesocosms, while for the unplanted mesocosms, Actinobacterial, Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria exhibited increased proportion under the exposure of caffeine. At genus level, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Streptococcus were found to be increased in abundance after caffeine treatment. As for the response of fungal community to caffeine enrichment, genus like Cladosporium, Emericellopsis, Aspergillus, and Phoma were found to be resistant to caffeine disturbance. When compared to the microbial community between planted and unplanted mesocosms, a distinct community profile for both bacteria and fungi community was observed. The presence of plants had a remarkable effect on the structure of microbial community, helping buffer against the stress associated with caffeine exposure.

AB Lists of compounds resulting from environmental monitoring may be conveniently represented in a very general way using Pareto distributions, after ranking them on descending order according to their concentration or hazard quotient expressed as percentages, depending on whether the objective of the monitoring is focussed on mass load occurrence or risk assessment respectively.
   Ranked distributions are characterized using appropriate indexes, such as h (Hirsch), well known in other disciplines like bibliometry. Furthermore, to such ordered distributions, simple numerical power type equations relating rank order and occurrence probability can be fitted, following the so-called power or Zipf law. Both h indices and the characteristic power law exponents are interpreted as measures of complexity of the overall mixture. On the other hand, compounds included within the h index may be seen as the most relevant in the mixture, thus providing a reasonable indication of what is worth analyzing. These concepts have been applied, as case study, to the characterization of the pharmaceutical compounds found in the input and output streams of wastewater treatment plants.
   Whereas both the concentration load and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs obviously decrease in the output of the treatment (influent > effluent, sludge), complexity quantified using the proposed indexes does not follow the same trend, being this behaviour common to the three plants examined.
   The joint combination of h compounds of the three plants studied allowed optimizing the list of compounds to be analyzed, which must be considered the key ones for the scenario under study.

AB Simultaneous analysis of 11 free estrogen hormones and five conjugated estrogens in water and municipal wastewater was studied. The analytical method was developed and tested for different types of solid-phase extraction adsorbents, eluents, sample containers and storage conditions, derivatization, and matrix effects. Varian Bond Elut C-18 solid-phase extraction adsorbent cartridge was selected based on its high recoveries for both free and conjugated estrogens. Sample storage conditions, as well as selection and pretreatment of sample container materials, can affect the trace level analysis of estrogens. Silanization of glassware is observed to provide low relative standard deviation (RSD) in the analysis and less percentage loss due to contacting with sample container materials. Light exposure during the test can significantly impact the results. The derivatized samples stored at -20A degrees C for at least 6 days showed less than 10.5% average RSD in the analysis. The recovery efficiency in clean water varies from 72% to 101% for free estrogens and 78% to 82% for conjugated estrogens. The method detection limits (MDL) for most of the compounds range from 30 to 870 ng/L using a sample volume of 200 mL. With a sample volume of 3 L, the most sensitive compound produces a MDL of 0.03 ng/L. Dilute methanol is used to wash the loaded cartridge as a cleanup step in order to remove interfering species during analysis of wastewater samples. Using the optimized analytical methods, the concentration level of free estrogens in the influent and effluent municipal wastewaters is tested.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in water bodies is associated with the increasing consumption of these substances and limited elimination from wastewater. Pharmaceutical residues and their metabolites may have an unfavorable impact on fish and other aquatic biota. As the purification of wastewater from tramadol is very limited and the knowledge on its effects on non-target organisms is low, we decided to assess the subchronic impact of tramadol hydrochloride on fish-on the mortality, growth and histopathology, together with the impact on selected indices of oxidative stress. The juvenile growth toxicity test was carried out on zebrafish (Danio rerio), in accordance with the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation Guidelines 215 (Fish, Juvenile Growth Test). The fish were exposed to a range of tramadol hydrochloride concentrations (0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 600 mu g/L) for 28 days. The outcome of this study suggests that chosen concentrations of tramadol hydrochloride did not affect either mortality or growth (regarding weight, length and specific growth rate). However, the results of this study indicate that 28-day exposure can negatively influence selected indices of oxidative stress, which is a harmful imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in an organism. A significant increase was observed in glutathione S-transferase activity in the experimental group exposed to 2 mu g/L tramadol hydrochloride, compared to the control. Moreover, lipid peroxidation was observed in groups exposed to 20 and 200 mu g/L, in comparison to the control.

AB This work evaluates the Fenton process in the removal of eight pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, nimesulide, furosemide, paracetamol, propranolol, dipyrone, fluoxetine, and diazepam), present at an initial concentration of 500 mu g L-1 for each compound, from three different water matrixes (distilled water, simulated wastewater, and hospital wastewater). The Fenton process conditions (iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations, and pH) were optimized for the distilled water matrix by Doehlert design associated with response surface methodology. These corresponded to initial Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 12.5 and 533 mg L-1, respectively, and pH 5.0. Mineralization rates and pharmaceutical degradation were monitored for all water matrixes and different experimental conditions employed. Unique iron addition, using low (12.5 mg L-1) and increased concentrations (37.5 mg L-1) were evaluated. These preliminary results motivated the study of the Fenton process employing successive iron additions and using an excess of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction medium. Multiple iron addition favored higher oxidation of the initial contaminants. Finally, the most persistent transformation products generated during the Fenton process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) using a purpose-built database that allowed monitoring 97 transformation products in a single injection. In this study, 12 transformation products (TPs) were tentatively identified employing this purpose-built database. Most TPs generated were classified as of high toxicity (Cramer rules) and showed ready biodegradability (START biodegradability).

AB Paracetamol, the most widely and globally used analgesic and antipyretic, is easily accumulated in aquatic environments. In the present study, the biodegradation of paracetamol in different media (one for general growth, one specific for sulfate reducing bacteria, a mineral salts medium and municipal wastewater) inoculated with two types of sludge (from anaerobic lagoon and from oxidation ditch) under different oxygenic conditions (anoxic; moderate oxygenation in open flasks and high oxygenation by aeration) was investigated. In addition, bacteria with relative abundances increasing simultaneously with paracetamol degradation, when this drug was the only carbon source, thus with a putative role in its degradation, were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences. The results show that aerobic microorganisms had a major role in the degradation of paracetamol, with 50 mg/L totally removed from municipal wastewater after 2 days incubation with aeration, and that the metabolites 4-aminophenol and hydroquinone plus one compound not identified in this work were produced in the process. The identification of bacteria with a role in the degradation of paracetamol revealed a strain from genus Pseudomonas with the highest final relative abundance of 21.2%, confirming previous works reporting strains of this genus as paracetamol decomposers. Besides, genera Flavobacterium, Dokdonella and Methylophilus were also in evidence, with initial relative abundances of 1.66%, 1.48 and 0.00% (not detected) in the inoculum and 6.91%, 3.80 and 3.83% after incubation, respectively. Therefore, a putative role of these genera in paracetamol biodegradation is suggested for the first time.

AB In this study, seven strains of bacteria with polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)-producing ability (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomona huttiensis, Yersinia frederiksenii, Aeromonas ichthiosmia, and Sphingopyxis terrae) were isolated from various waste treatment plants in Hong Kong. Simultaneous wastewater treatment and PHA accumulation were successfully achieved in the bioreactors using isolated bacteria from different sludges. At the organic loading less than 13,000 ppm, more than 95% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed by the isolated strains before the decrease of PHA accumulation. In addition, more than 95% of nitrogen removal was achieved by all isolated strains. In the bioreactors inoculated with single strains, the highest yields of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHV) were obtained in A. ichthiosmia (84 mg PHB/g) and B. cereus (69 mg/g), respectively. For the mixed culture, the highest yields of PHB and PHV were increased by 55% and 45% in the system inoculated with B. pumilus and A. ichthiosmia. The biologically synthesized PHA also showed the potential applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering. PHA-nanoparticles loaded with pyrene were successfully prepared by recombinant Escherichia coli. The results of in vitro drug release and biocompatibility tests revealed that nanoparticles could be used as safer dray carriers with high loading capacity and efficiency. After 20 days, the cells successfully grew on 90% of the PHA-aortic valve.

AB An electrochemical advanced oxidation process employing a boron-doped diamond anode for the treatment of synthetic waters and secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) was studied. The efficiency and formation of transformation products (TPs) for this treatment process were investigated at different current densities for bisphenol A (BPA) spiked to synthetic water and WWTP effluents. A complete removal of the parent compound was achieved in WWTP effluents. Higher applied current densities resulted in faster removal. At the same time, a correlation between the applied current density and the ozone concentration measured in the bulk solution was revealed. Hence, the observed transformation of BPA is likely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and ozone. Based on a suspected target screening approach, four known TPs and two unreported (new) TPs were identified by LC-MS analysis. These results suggest a transformation pathway following three steps: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, followed by oxidation of the isopropylidene bridge and finally a ring opening and formation of organic acids and other small molecules. The presence of chloride ions in WWTP effluents can result in the generation of excessive concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate during electrochemical oxidation. Applying a current density of 208 mA cm(-2), a complete elimination of BPA was achievable after 15 min (Q/V = 430 mA h L-1); however, the oxidation resulted in concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate of 2.85 and 5.65 mg L-1, respectively. These values were directly dependent on the exposure time and desired degree of BPA removal.

AB The use of kinetic models to predict oxidation performance in wastewater is limited due to fast ozone depletion during the first milliseconds of the reaction. This paper introduces the Quench Flow Module (QFM), a bench-scale experimental technique developed to measure the first 5-500 milliseconds of ozone depletion for accurate determination of ozone exposure in wastewater-ozonation processes. Calculated ozone exposure in QFM experiments was up to 24% lower than in standard batch experiments, strongly depending on the initial sampling point for measurement in batch experiments. However, oxidation rates of slowly- and moderately-reacting trace organic compounds (TrOCs) were accurately predicted from batch experiments based on integration of ozone depletion and removal of an ozone resistant probe compound to calculate oxidant exposures. An alternative concept, where ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures are back-calculated from the removal of two probe compounds, was tested as well. Although the QFM was suggested to be an efficient mixing reactor, ozone exposure ranged over three orders of magnitude when different probe compounds reacting moderately with ozone were used for the calculation. These effects were beyond uncertainty ranges for apparent second order rate constants and consistently observed with different ozone-injection techniques, i.e. QFM, batch experiments, bubble columns and venturi injection. This indicates that previously suggested mixing effects are not responsible for the difference and other still unknown factors might be relevant. Results furthermore suggest that ozone exposure calculations from the relative residual concentration of a probe compound are not a promising option for evaluation of ozonation of secondary effluents.

AB The present work was conducted to optimize operating parameters for electrocoagulation treatment of a pharmaceutical effluent. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity removals were monitored for each experiment since they are good indicators of wastewater quality The effects of three parameters such as pH (4-10), current density (i=20-80 mA/cm(2)), and time of reaction (t=10-30 min) were evaluated using a response surface methodology (RSM) and in particular a full factorial central composite face-centered (CCF) design. The obtained experimental data were fit to a second-order polynomial equation using multiple regressions and were also analyzed by variance analysis (ANOVA). The contour plots derived from the mathematical models were applied to determine the optimal conditions (pH of 5.31, current density of 46.83 mA/cm(2), and electrolysis time of 17.99 min). Under these conditions, the experimental COD and turbidity removals were found equal to 75.64 and 96.34%, respectively, which were in agreement with the values predicted by the models. The electrocoagulation mechanism was modeled using Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. The obtained results showed that the Freundlich isotherm correctly predicted the experimental data. Operating costs included energy and electrode consumption as performed for the process of treatment. It was noted that the general cost varied from 0.1053-2.8289 US$ for current densities ranging from 20-80 mA/cm(2) and electrolysis times from 10-30 min. Under optimal conditions, the general cost was found equal to 0.8113 US$/m(3).

AB The extent hospital effluent contributes to antimicrobial presence in the environment and its impact on resistance dissemination remains unknown. To investigate the fate of the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin in hospital effluent a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to model levels from hospital use to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent release, in addition to modeling resistance formation potential, hazard quotient (HQ) and swimmer exposure. The mean predicted concentration (PC) of ciprofloxacin in hospital effluent, urban effluent, WWTP effluent, sludge, soil and sea water was 579, 6.06, 2.59, 3.48, 0.006 and 0.15mg/m3, respectively. A parallel surveillance study confirmed levels of ciprofloxacin above or below the limit of detection. The model predicted levels would never exceed the ECOSAR toxicity value. The model predicted a 98% probability of ciprofloxacin exhibiting a HQ > 1 (low toxicity concern). The mean ciprofloxacin PC in WWTP effluent was less than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The probability of conditions in WWTP effluent being favorable for resistance at 20% and 80% of the MIC was 3% and 72%, respectively. In all instances, when the MIC was bound, the probability for resistance formation within soil and sea water was < 1%. The probability of a swimmer being exposed to a level of ciprofloxacin greater than the acceptable daily intake was negligible. The study concluded that release of hospital effluent into the environment may lead to concentrations of ciprofloxacin which are of low toxicity concern but may be conducive to resistance formation and allow for the dissemination of resistance.

ID GAMMA-LACTAMASE
AB A synthetic polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP - E 1201) primarily finds applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries due to its resistance and zero toxicity to organisms. After ingestion, the substance passes through the organism unchanged. Consequently, it enters the systems of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) without decomposing biologically during the waste treatment process, nor does it attach (through sorption) to particles of activated sludge to any significant extent, therefore, it passes through the system of a WWTP, which may cause the substance to accumulate in the natural environment. For this reason the paper investigates the potential to initiate aerobic biodegradation of PVP in the presence of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The following agents were selected as the initiators of the biodegradation process - co-substrates: acrylamide, N-acethylphenylalanine and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a substance with a similar structure to PVP monomer. The biodegradability of PVP in the presence of co-substrates was evaluated on the basis of biological oxygen demand (BOD) as determined via a MicroOxymax O-2/CO2/CH4 respirometer. The total substrate concentration in the suspension equaled 400 mg.dm(-3), with the ratio between PVP and the co-substrate being 1:1, while the concentration of the dry activated sludge was 500 mg.dm(-3). Even though there was no occurrence of a significant increase in the biodegradation of PVP alone in the presence of a co-substrate, acrylamide appeared to be the most effective type of co-substrate. Nevertheless, a recorded decrease in the slope of biodegradation curves over time may indicate that a process of primary decomposition was underway, which involves the production of metabolites that inhibit activated sludge microorganisms. The resulting products are not identified at this stage of experimentation.

AB A study was conducted to examine the influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solid retention time (SRT) on the removal of tetracycline in the activated sludge processes. Two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated to simulate the activated sludge process. One SBR was spiked with 250 mu g/L tetracycline, while the other SBR was evaluated at tetracycline concentrations found in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) where the activated sludge was obtained. The concentrations of tetracyclines in the influent of the WWTP ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 mu g/L. Three different operating conditions were applied during the study (phase 1-HRT: 24 h and SRT: 10 days; phase 2-HRT: 7.4 h and SRT: 10 days; and phase 3-HRT: 7.4 h and SRT: 3 days). The removal efficiency of tetracycline in phase 3 (78.4 +/- 7.1%) was significantly lower than that observed in phase 1 (86.4 +/- 8.7%) and phase 2 (85.1 +/- 5.4%) at the 95% confidence level. The reduction of SRT in phase 3 while maintaining a constant HRT decreased tetracycline removal efficiency. Sorption kinetics reached equilibrium within 24 h. Batch equilibrium experiments yielded an adsorption coefficient (K-ads) of 8400 +/- 500 mL/g and a desorption coefficient (K-des) of 22 600 +/- 2200 mL/g. No evidence of biodegradation for tetracycline was observed during the biodegradability test, and sorption was found to be the principal removal mechanism of tetracycline in activated sludge.

AB Trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS-WWTPs) and are discharged into surface waters, where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain TrOCs. The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-VVWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, >= 90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies. Qualitative comparison with CAS literature shows potentially higher IFAS removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench- or pilot-scale studies (atenolol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, DEET, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tertoctylphenol), as well as the chlorinated flame retardants TCIPP and TDCIPP. Effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full-scale CAS-WWTPs. These results provide the first survey of multiple full-scale IFAS-WWTPs employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of basic chemical endpoints (removal of ammonia, TN, TP, and COD), the distribution of solids within the systems, and the removal of TrOCs and estrogenic activity.

AB The growth of industries and population is accompanied by the introduction of emerging chemical pollutants such as pharmaceutical compounds into natural water sources. The purification of these pollutants is essential to protect the environment and promote community health. The present study aims to investigate the removal of acetaminophen (ACT), one of the most widely used pharmaceutical compounds, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) through a completely environmentally friendly biological method, namely cyclic biological reactor (CBR). This process is performed using high-load synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater on a laboratory scale. During the study the effect of cycle time, hydraulic retention time (HRT), ACT and COD concentration, and temperature on reactor performance are inspected. Finally, the performances of two CBR and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are compared. Financial analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and nonlinear regression are applied to study the influence of cycle time and concentration of ACT and COD on CBR performance. Two cubic models have been developed for the effect of cycle and concentration on ACT and COD removal efficiencies using design expert software. The models are utilized to calculate the optimum operating conditions. At 18-h cycle and 500 mg/L ACT and 7600 mg/L COD concentrations, the models show 98 % and 95 % removal efficiencies for ACT and COD, respectively. Results showed that CBR is an economically proper process to treat various types of wastewaters thanks to its low-space occupation, easy operation, low-energy consumption, and, high efficiency. It can also be used to upgrade old treatment plants in the future.

AB The ever-increasing presence of contaminants in environmental waters is an alarming issue, not only because of their harmful effects in the environment but also because of their risk to human health. Pharmaceuticals and pesticides, among other compounds of daily use, such as personal care products or plasticisers, are being released into water bodies. This release mainly occurs through wastewater since the treatments applied in many wastewater treatment plants are not able to completely remove these substances. Therefore, the analysis of these contaminants is essential but this is difficult due to the great variety of contaminating substances. Facing this analytical challenge, electrochemical sensing based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) has become an interesting field for environmental monitoring. Benefiting from their superior chemical and physical stability, low-cost production, high selectivity and rapid response, MIPs combined with miniaturized electrochemical transducers offer the possibility to detect target analytes in-situ. In most reports, the construction of these sensors include nanomaterials to improve their analytical characteristics, especially their sensitivity. Moreover, these sensors have been successfully applied in real water samples without the need of laborious pre-treatment steps. This review provides a general overview of electrochemical MIP-based sensors that have been reported for the detection of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants in water samples in the past decade. Special attention is given to the construction of the sensors, including different functional monomers, sensing platforms and materials employed to achieve the best sensitivity. Additionally, several parameters, such as the limit of detection, the linear concentration range and the type of water samples that were analysed are compiled.

AB Pharmaceutical pollution is becoming an unavoidable environmental issue of emerging concern. As forecasted, the consumption of medicinal drugs and their use in veterinary practice is expected to systematically increase over coming years, resulting in their increased discharge. The most commonly used pharmaceuticals include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen), cardiovascular drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, lipid-regulating agents), antibiotics, oral contraceptives, anti-depressants, immunosuppressive drugs and cytostatics. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are known to partially survive the conventional process of wastewater treatment. In freshwaters, they may undergo photodegradation, biodegradation, sorption to sediments and uptake by organisms. The latter results in metabolism or bioaccumulation, and potential toxicological effects and physiological responses. The magnitude of effects is largely modulated by the concentration of APIs, time of exposure and some environmental factors such as light and nutrient availability. The response to APIs in closely taxonomically related species may be significantly different. The concomitant presence of different APIs usually evokes potentiation of adverse effects. The most serious effects of pharmaceutical pollution evidenced so far for freshwaters include increase in antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, feminization, behavioral changes, and immunosuppression in fish. Beyond any doubt, it is imperative to support systematic research on API detection methods, to monitor the great number of APIs in wastewater, surface and groundwater, and tap water, and to assess the ecological risks arising from their increased presence in the freshwater environment.

AB The efficiency of UV irradiation for the removal of the antimycotic drugs fluconazole (FCZ) and climbazole (CBZ) from water samples is evaluated. Degradation experiments, at laboratory scale, were carried out with spiked aliquots of ultrapure water solutions and treated wastewater samples using low-pressure mercury lamps emitting at 254 nm. Time course of precursor pollutants and identification of arising transformation products (TPs) was performed by injection of different reaction time aliquots in a liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) system. Chemical structures of identified TPs were proposed from their full-product ion spectra, acquired using different collision energies. During UV irradiation experiments, the half-lives (t(1/2)) of FCZ and CBZ were similar in ultrapure water solutions and wastewater samples; however, the first species was more recalcitrant than the second one. Four TPs were identified in case of FCZ resulting from substitution of fluorine atoms by hydroxyl moieties and intramolecular cyclization with fluorine removal. CBZ interacted with UV radiation through reductive dechlorination, hydroxylation and cleavage of the ether bond; moreover, five additional primary TPs, with the same empirical formula as CBZ, were also noticed. Given the relatively long t(1/2) of FCZ under direct photolysis (ca. 42 min), UV irradiation was combined with H2O2 addition to promote formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals. Under such conditions, the degradation rate of FCZ was enhanced significantly and no TPs were detected. These latter conditions allowed also the effective removal of CBZ TPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using diclofenac (DFC) as a template, 2-vinylpyridine (2-VP) as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linker, and toluene as porogen. The MIP showed outstanding affinity toward DFC in aqueous solution with a binding site capacity (Q(max)) of 324.8 mg/g (1.09 mmol/g) and was used as solid-phase extraction (SPE) material for the quantitative enrichment of DFC in environmental water samples and off-line coupled to a reversed-phase HPLC/DAD. Various parameters including washing solvent, elution solvent and breakthrough volume affecting the extraction efficiency of the polymers have been evaluated to achieve the selective preconcentration of DFC from water samples and to reduce nonspecific interactions. Recoveries of DFC extracted from tap water, river water and wastewater samples were higher than 95%, and no significant DFC recovery difference was obtained among the different water matrix. The stability of MIP was tested by consecutive percolation of water sample, and it was shown that the performance of the MIP did not vary even after 30 adsorption and desorption cycles. Furthermore, the MISPE was used for the analysis of DFC in river water and wastewater samples and revealed DFC concentrations of 0.69 +/- 0.002 mu g/L (n = 3) and 0.31 +/- 0.004 mu g/L (n = 3), respectively. The results were in good agreement with corresponding LC-MS/MS data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The artificial sweetener sucralose has recently been shown to be a widespread of contaminant of wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. In order to understand its occurrence in drinking water systems, water samples from 19 United States (U.S.) drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) serving more than 28 million people were analyzed for sucralose using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sucralose was found to be present in source water of 15 out of 19 DWTPs (47-2900 ng/L), finished water of 13 out of 17 DWTPs (49-2400 ng/L) and distribution system water of 8 out Of the 12 DWTPs (48-2400 ng/L) tested. Sucralose was only found to be present in source waters with known wastewater influence and/or recreational usage, and displayed low removal (12% average) in the DWTPs where finished water was sampled. Further, in the subset of DWTPs with distribution system water sampled, the compound was found to persist regardless of the presence of residual chlorine or chloramines. In order to understand intra-DWTP consistency, sucralose was monitored at one drinking water treatment plant over an 11 month period from March 2010 through January 2011, and averaged 440 ng/L in the source water and 350 ng/L in the finished water. The results of this study confirm that sucralose will function well as an indicator compound for anthropogenic influence on source, finished drinking and distribution system (i.e., tap) water, as well as an indicator compound for the presence of other recalcitrant compounds in finished drinking water in the U.S.

AB Psychotropic pharmaceuticals account for a large proportion of the most prescribed drugs globally. They cannot be completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which raise a concern about their occurrence and ecotoxicology in the aquatic system. In the present study, we developed a sensitive and reliable method and analyzed 34 psychotropic pharmaceuticals in river water of the megacity Shanghai. The impacts of WWTPs on the contamination of psychoactive drugs were also evaluated by comparing the river water samples collected from upstream and downstream of WWTPs. Among the target substances, 29 drugs were detected in the water samples with the concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 260 ng/L, and the occurrence of five of them in river water was reported for the first time. Many psychotropic pharmaceuticals occurred in river water simultaneously with the total concentration up to 480 ng/L. The spatial distribution of psychotropic pharmaceuticals and the ratio between venlafaxine and its metabolite indicated the contamination of psychotropic pharmaceuticals was higher in populated areas but municipal WWTPs had little impact on their contaminations in the urban river of Shanghai, suggesting other important emission sources other than domestic wastewater exist. Exposure of zebrafish embryos further demonstrated multiple developmental effects caused by several of the most detected substances and, especially, by their mixtures and highlighted their interference with the neural development of zebrafish. Thus, our results provide novel insights into the understanding of the occurrence of psychotropic pharmaceuticals in surface waters and their ecotoxicological risks to aquatic organisms.

AB Hyporheic zones are the water-saturated flow-through subsurfaces of rivers which are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple physical, biological, and chemical processes. Two factors playing a role in the hyporheic attenuation of organic contaminants are sediment bedforms (a major driver of hyporheic exchange) and the composition of the sediment microbial community. How these factors act on the diverse range of organic contaminants encountered downstream from wastewater treatment plants is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated dissipation half-lives (DT50s) of 31 substances (mainly pharmaceuticals) under different combinations of bacterial diversity and bedform-induced hyporheic flow using 20 recirculating flumes in a central composite face factorial design. By combining small-volume pore water sampling, targeted analysis, and suspect screening, along with quantitative real-time PCR and time-resolved amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we determined a comprehensive set of DT50s, associated bacterial communities, and microbial transformation products. The resulting DT50s of parent compounds ranged from 0.5 (fluoxetine) to 306 days (carbamazepine), with 20 substances responding significantly to bacterial diversity and four to both diversity and hyporheic flow. Bacterial taxa that were associated with biodegradation included Acidobacteria (groups 6, 17, and 22), Actinobacteria (Nocardioides and Illumatobacter), Bacteroidetes (Terrimonas and Flavobacterium) and diverse Proteobacteria (Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae). Notable were the formation of valsartan acid from irbesartan and valsartan, the persistence of N-desmethylvenlafaxine across all treatments, and the identification of biuret as a novel transformation product of metformin. Twelve additional target transformation products were identified, which were persistent in either pore or surface water of at least one treatment, indicating their environmental relevance.

AB The capability of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles photo-deposited on BiVO4 (BV) nanosheets support to effectively activate persulfate (PS) and degrade pharmaceutical residues amiloride (AML) in aqueous solution under visible light was investigated. The removal efficiency of AML in Pd/BV/PS/vis system reached to 96.43% within 30 min as compared to only 50.73%, 70.87% and 77.70% in BV/vis, Pd/BV/vis and BV/PS/vis respectively under the identical experimental conditions. One inherent reason for the enhanced performance was possibly owing to the fact that visible light absorption of photocatalyst was improved through the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Pd nanoparticles. For another respect, the photo-induced electron-hole pairs separation rate was firstly strengthened with Pd as electron traps and then by PS oxidants as electrons acceptors. Influencing factors including PS dosage, AML concentration, humic acid (HA) concentration, coexisting anions and cations and water sources on the AML degradation in the Pd/BV/PS/vis system were explored in details. Higher photocatalytic activity was still maintained in raw wastewater containing dyes, phenols and antibiotics. More generation of oxidative species such as O-center dot(2)-, (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- were verified by radical quenching experiment and electron spin resonance (ESR) test. The major products of AML decomposition were identified and the correspondent degradation pathways were also proposed. This founding allows for the construction of highly efficient BV-based photocatalysts and provides a new opportunity for the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants by SO4 center dot- based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).

AB A sensitive method for simultaneous determination of 20 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs, including preservatives, antioxidants, disinfectants, oestrogens, alkyl-phenols and bisphenol-A) in surface water and wastewater has been developed and validated based on the optimisation of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. 500 mL acidified (pH = 2.5) water samples were pre-concentrated by Supel-Select HLB cartridge (200 mg, 6 mL) and eluted with 12 mL mixture of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate (50:50, v/v). This optimised SPE procedure could provide >75% recoveries for the majority of TOrCs. The instrumental methods were developed using two different LC-MS systems: a triple -quadrupole MS (QqQ-MS) and a hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap high resolution MS (Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). Both showed good performance data, but the former system provided better linearity and method precision, with the latter system providing 2-33 times lower detection limits. Different matrix effects were observed for both systems: No remarkable matrix effects were observed for Q-Orbitrap-HRMS but significant matrix effects were found in influent and river water samples for the QqQ-MS. This analytical method was subsequently employed to analyse the TOrCs in river waters and wastewaters from China successfully, which confirmed its applicability to environmental samples.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for groundwater recharge is an effective way to provide advanced treatment and water storage. Contaminants such as human drugs have been identified as a potential problem for use of this water. Gilbert, Arizona maintains a 28.3-ha facility designed to recharge 15,150 m(3) d(-1) through recharge basins constructed on native soil. The facility averages an infiltration rate of > 5 cm d(-1), resulting in the potential of pharmaceutical compounds leaching to groundwater. One 4-ha basin was selected for spatial sampling of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The compounds were carbamazepine, lincomycin, ibuprofen, and caffeine. Soils were extracted and analyzed using pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. The concentration of ibuprofen was below detection limits in all samples. Lincomycin exhibited no net accumulation from year to year but had significantly higher concentrations from depths of 0 to 5 cm than from depths > 10 cm. Carbamazepine had the lowest concentration at 0 to 5 cm (0.18 ng g soil(-1)), providing evidence that there is potential degradation of carbamazepine in surface soils. Carbamazepine also exhibited significant accumulation from year to year. Caffeine exhibited net accumulation and had higher concentrations in surface samples. The accumulation of PhACs in the soil beneath recharge basins indicates that PhACs are being removed from the infiltrating water and that, regarding ibuprofen and lincomycin, the treatment is sustainable due to the lack of accumulation. Regarding carbamazepine and caffeine, further investigations are needed to determine possible management and environmental conditions that could prevent accumulation.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been frequently found in the environment. It is, however, still not quite clear who is mainly responsible for API emissions. Hospitals have been considered to be the main contributing point sources for wastewater (WW) discharge of APIs. However, recent studies have shown that the contribution of hospitals to the input of APIs into the aquatic environment is quite low. Due to demographic change and the increase of psychiatric diseases, health institutions (His) such as psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes are likely to be important sources as well, but no data is available in this respect. This study aims to assess the impact of His and to provide a methodology to measure their respective contributions. Drawing on pharmaceutical consumption data for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012, this study identified API usage patterns for a psychiatric hospital (146 beds), a nursing home (286 inhabitants), and a general hospital (741 beds), the latter of which comprises three separate locations. All the HIs are located in two sub-regions of a county district with about 400,000 citizens in southwestern Germany. A selection of neurological drugs was quantified in the sewer of these facilities to evaluate the correlation between consumption and emission. The API contribution of His was assessed by comparing the specific consumption in the facilities with the consumption in households, expressed as the emission potential (I-EP). The study shows that the usage patterns of APIs in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home were different from the general hospital. Neurological drugs such as anticonvulsants, psycholeptics, and psydioanaleptics were mainly consumed in the psychiatric hospital and the nursing home (74% and 65%, respectively). Predicted and average measured concentrations in the effluent of the investigated HIs differed mostly by less than one order of magnitude. Therefore, the consumption-based approach is a useful method to assess usage patterns of APIs in His and to predict their respective contributions to WW. The national contribution of His on total WW discharge of APIs compared to households was very low. Only the results for the sedative clomethiazole in general hospitals as well as the antidepressant moclobemide and the antipsychotic quetiapine for the nursing homes were found to deserve some attention. The regional comparison showed that in sub-regions with a comparably higher density of His, the allocated facilities could be seen as point sources emitting particular APIs. However, in general, the bulk of the consumed pharmaceuticals to WW discharge has to be attributed to households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin in river waters may impair aquatic ecosystem health and drinking water quality. To evaluate micropollutant fate and turnover on a catchment scale, information on input source characteristics as well as spatial and temporal variability is required. The influence of tributaries from agricultural and urban areas and the input of wastewater were investigated by grab and Lagrangian sampling under base flow conditions within a 7.7-km-long stretch of the Ammer River (southwest Germany) using target screening for 83 organic micropollutants and 4 in vitro bioassays with environmentally relevant modes of action. In total, 9 pesticides and transformation products, 13 pharmaceuticals, and 6 industrial and household chemicals were detected. Further, aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity, estrogenicity, and oxidative stress response were measured in the river. The vast majority of the compounds and mixture effects were introduced by the effluent of a wastewater-treatment plant, which contributed 50% of the total flow rate of the river on the sampling day. The tributaries contributed little to the overall load of organic micropollutants and mixture effects because of their relatively low discharge but showed a different chemical and toxicological pattern from the Ammer River, though a comparison to effect-based trigger values pointed toward unacceptable surface water quality in the main stem and in some of the tributaries. Chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays covered different windows of analyte properties but reflected the same picture.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-10.

AB Considered the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, caffeine became a widespread environmental pollutant, contaminating both the hydrosphere as well as the pedosphere, by thus leading to an unclear effect on the surrounding biosphere. Unsuccessfully treated by regular wastewater-treatment plants, caffeine concentrations in discharged effluents and natural reservoirs are constantly rising. New water-treatment technologies are being developed to reduce the concentrations of such emerging contaminants. Photodegradation is recently drawing much attention due to its potential to oxidize such contaminating compounds and its large-scale deployment is still being evaluated. In order to optimize these processes, quantifying and developing new kinetics models are an essential step. In this work, the photodegradation kinetics of caffeine was evaluated under different UV-C doses (1.9-15.2 mJ cm(-2) s(-1) and lambda = 254 nm) and in the presence of two degradation agents, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and commercial titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanopowder. For an initial concentration of 19,600 mu g L-1 caffeine, the removal rate was higher than 95% for both agents separately, yielding half-life times of 40-5 min for 16.3-163 mu mol L-1 H2O2 and 96-9 min for 1-100 mu g L-1 TiO2 suspension, respectively. The degradation rates were governed by pseudo-zero-order reaction kinetics at high caffeine-to-agents ratios (>0.6 for H2O2 and >400 for TiO2), whereas pseudo-first-order kinetics were seen at lower ratios in experiments with TiO2. Empirical and theoretical rate laws describing the degradation kinetics and their possible mechanism are presented.

AB Thirteen wastewater-marking pharmaceuticals were selected to explore their variations and behavior under hydrodynamic conditions in urban river systems. Four flow velocities were set, i.e., 0 cm/s for static condition, and 5, 10 and 20 cm/s for dynamic conditions. In the water phase, most of target compounds emerged big fluctuations between static and dynamic conditions. The lower concentrations were detected in the dynamic conditions. However, carbamazepine had minimum relative change during the whole 15-day tests with at least 85% of the initial concentration remaining. In the sediment, the concentrations of most pharmaceuticals in the dynamic conditions were higher than in the static condition, whereas carbamazepine showed big fluctuation in both static and dynamic conditions. With the change of the flow velocities, all target pharmaceuticals showed obviously different variation tendencies mainly due to the changes of environmental parameters, such as turbidity, dissolved matters, microbial biomass, and suspended particulates. In addition, five metabolites were selected to further investigate the transformation of diclofenac and carbamazepine with different flow velocities in the water phase. More diclofenac were transformed into 4-Hydroxy diclofenac in the water phase in the dynamic conditions. Moreover, in the case of a set flow velocity, the concentrations of some pharmaceuticals changed remarkably between the straight and turning channels of an urban river system. Overall, hydrodynamic conditions showed significant influences on the levels of target compounds in the aquatic environment and, therefore, could be taken into account in the risk assessment and control of these compounds.

AB The aim of this work is to synthesize a magnetic magnetite/multi-walled carbon nanotube (Fe3O4/MWCNT) catalyst by a method combining co-precipitation and hydrothermal treatments for the efficient removal of diclofenac (DCF) by catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO). The support (MWCNTs) shows a moderate-large surface area and good adsorption capacity, leading to the improvement of the magnetite (Fe3O4) dispersion on its surface. The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied in order to find out the effect of the reaction parameters on DCF removal, allowing to establish the optimum operating conditions (T=60 degrees C, [H2O2](0)=2.7mM, [catalyst]=1.0gL(-1)). The optimum CWPO experiment showed an outstanding catalytic activity at non-modified pH solution (6.7), obtaining a 95% of DCF removal after 3h reaction time; this high efficiency can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the iron-based catalyst with the high quantity of (OH)-O-center dot radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst. In addition, the Fe3O4/MWCNT material exhibited good reusability along three consecutive reaction cycles, finding a pollutant removal close to 95% in each cycle of 3h reaction time. Additionally, a degradation mechanism pathway was proposed for the removal of DCF by CWPO. The versatility of the material was finally demonstrated in the treatment of different environmentally relevant aqueous matrices (a wastewater treatment plant effluent, surface water, and hospital wastewater), obtaining an effective reduction in the ecotoxicity values.

AB Increasing emphasis on resource recovery from wastewater highlights the importance of capturing valuable products, e.g., nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, while removing contaminants, e.g., organic micropollutants. The objective of this research was to evaluate the fate of the micropollutants triclosan (present as a mixture of neutral and anionic species at neutral pH), 17 beta-estradiol (neutral at neutral pH), and sulfamethoxazole (anionic at neutral pH) during nutrient recovery using ion exchange-precipitation. Adsorption of the three micropollutants to the phosphate-selective ion exchange resins LayneRT and DOWHFO-Cu ranged from 54% to 88% in Milli-Q water tests and 50% to 71% in wastewater tests using anaerobic effluent. The micropollutants did not sorb to the ammonium-selective exchanger, clinoptilolite. The presence of the micropollutants reduced the kinetic rates of nutrient exchange onto ion exchangers. However, the micropollutants did not interfere with nutrient capacity on the ion exchangers, likely due to the low concentration of micropollutants and potentially different mechanisms of adsorption (i.e., Coulombic and non-Coulombic attractions for micropollutants) compared to the target ions. Micropollutants that sorbed to the phosphate exchangers were released with phosphate ions during regeneration. Concentrations of NaOH and NaCl in regeneration solutions did not correlate with micropollutant desorption. Among the micropollutants studied, the more hydrophobic triclosan and 17 beta-estradiol adsorbed to the resins to greater extents. These compounds also demonstrated lower desorption rates than sulfamethoxazole during regeneration in Milli-Q water tests. Batch struvite precipitation tests revealed that the micropollutants were not enmeshed in precipitated struvite crystals nor sorbed during crystallization, indicating that the struvite product was free of triclosan, 17 beta-estradiol, and sulfamethoxazole.

AB The degradation of thiocyanates (SCN-) by UV-C-activated persulfate (PS) in the presence of ferric ion (Fe3+) was investigated. As a source of monochromatic far-UV-C irradiation (222 nm), mercury-free KrCl excimer lamp was used. Results showed that compared with direct photolysis, UVC/ PS and PS/ Fe3+, the combined UVC/PS/Fe3+ treatment had the highest initial reaction rate omega(0) and removal efficiency. 99.99% conversion of thiocyanates (100 mg/L of initial concentration) was achieved in 40 min. The addition of Fe3+ in the UVC/ PS treatment was found to reduce energy consumption (calculated as amount of oxidized thiocyanates per consumed electrical energy) by 4.5 times, while only a 30% difference between direct photolysis and UVC/ PS was observed. The high efficiency of the UVC/ PS/ Fe3+ process revealed a synergistic effect (synergy index f = 1.98). The effect of the initial SCN, PS, and Fe3+ molar ratios and UV-C exposure time on SCN removal in UVC/ PS/Fe3+ was further investigated. It was found that at molar ratios [S2O82-]:[SCN-] = 3:1 and [S2O82-](:)[Fe3+] = 1:0.1, effective decomposition of SCN in a wide initial concentration range (from 50 to 500 mg/L or 0.86-8.6 mM) can be achieved. The strong role of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- in the removal of SCN- was confirmed by the addition of radical scavengers. It was demonstrated that the presence of Cu2+ in simulated gold mine wastewater effluents neutralizes the inhibitory effects that S2O32- and NH4+ have on the degradation process.

TI Trace organic contaminants removal from municipal wastewater using the

   Photoreactor; Scale-up; Antimicrobial activity
AB The main goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the innovative FluHelik photoreactor for the removal of antimicrobial drugs at residual concentrations using a photochemical UVC/H2O2 process. Experiment studies were performed using either pure water (PW) or secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant (EW) fortified with gatifloxacin (GAT) (100 mu g L-1) as a model antimicrobial contaminant. Initially, the efficiency of the UVC/H2O2 process towards GAT removal as a function of UVC lamp power (4-11 W), H2O2 dose (25-200 mg L-1), flow rate (20-180 L h(-1)), flow mode (single vs multiple pass) and matrix (PW or EW) was assessed. Afterwards, the system efficiency was evaluated according to engineering features such as association of reactors in series and scale-up design. The performance of the FluHelik reactor was quantitatively measured through the use of a figure-of-merit, photochemical space-time yield (PSTY), that encompasses the three main contributing factors in UVC/H2O2 systems (i.e. throughput, energy efficiency and photochemical oxidation). In this context, FluHelik scale-up to pre-pilot scale proved to be feasible as similar PSTY values were obtained at both scales for assays performed with EW. In addition, the pre-pilot scale system was able to degrade all pharmaceutical compounds originally detectable in the EW matrix, reducing their concentrations to values below limit of detection. Finally, in order to test whether the treated solution might develop antibiotic resistance when in the environment, antimicrobial activity assays using bacterial cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were investigated. The antimicrobial activity in the solutions dropped as the reaction time increased.

AB Both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses were conducted on juvenile ocean- type fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) residing in two estuaries receiving wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and one reference estuary. The data show that the metabolome patterns for fish from the two WWTP-receiving estuaries were more similar to each other compared to that for the reference site fish. Also, a comparison of the metabolome for fish from the reference site and fish from a hatchery upstream of one of the effluent-receiving estuaries indicated no differences, implying that residency for fish in the contaminated estuary resulted in major changes to the metabolome. Based on general health parameters including whole-body lipid content and condition factor, plus the availability of prey for these fish, we conclude that juvenile Chinook salmon in these contaminated estuaries may have been experiencing metabolic disruption without any overt signs of impairment. Additionally, a non-targeted analysis was performed on hatchery summer Chinook salmon from a laboratory study where fish were dosed for 32 days with feed containing 16 of the most common contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) detected in wild fish. In the laboratory experiment a relationship was observed between dose and the number of liver metabolites that were different between control and treatment fish. Laboratory fish were exposed to only 16 CECs, but are generally exposed to hundreds of these compounds in contaminated aquatic environments. These results have implications for the health of juvenile Chinook salmon and the likelihood of a successful life cycle when exposed to effluent-related chemicals. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Activated carbon from the shell of the cashew of Para (SCP) was produced by chemical activation with ZnCl using the ratio of SCP: ZnCl2 1.0:1.5 at 700 degrees C. The prepared activated carbon (SCP700) was used for the removal of two emerging contaminants, 4-bromophenol (4-BrPhOH) and 4-chloroaniline (4-ClPhNH2) that are primarily employed in the industry. Different analytical techniques were used to characterize the activated carbon. From the N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained the specific surface area of 1520 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.492 cm(3) g(-1). The functional groups were identified by the FTIR technique and quantified by modified Boehm titration. The results revealed the bearing of several functional groups on the SCP700 surface, which may utterly influence the removal of the emerging contaminants. The equilibrium experiments showed that the maximum uptaken capacities (Q(max)) achieved at 45 degrees C were 488.2 (4-BrPhOH) and 552.5 mg g(-1) (4-ClPhNH2). The thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the processes of 4-BrPhOH and 4-ClPhNH2 adsorption are exothermic, spontaneous, energetically suitable, and the magnitude of Delta H degrees is compatible with physisorption. The mechanism of the adsorption of the emerging contaminants onto the carbon surface is dominated by microporous filling, hydrogen bonds, pi-stacking interactions, and other Van der Waals interactions. The use of activated carbon for the treatment of industrial synthetic wastewater with several inorganic and organic molecules commonly found in industrial effluents showed a very high percentage of uptaking (up to 98.64%).

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using heterogeneous photocatalysis in presence of TiO2 nanoparticles has become a lucrative method because the convectional wastewater and biological treatments usually fail to remove the detrimental effect of different drugs and hormones on the environment. The nanoparticles recovery and reuse is the most challenging task in practice. The main goal of the present study is to recover and reuse of photocatalyst by immobilizing it on the membrane surface. Consequently, two types of immobilization technique have been used here, one is surface immobilization by dipped coating, and other is impregnation of catalyst during fabrication of the membrane. To conduct photocatalysis, an indigenous photo membrane reactor has also been fabricated during the research work. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles has not only improved the catalytic property of the membrane, but also the contact angle analysis has confirmed the enhanced hydrophilic as well as antifouling property of the surface modified membrane. The fabricated membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To analyses the performance of photo membrane reactor as well as TiO2 coated or impregnated membranes, the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibacterial drug, was performed using the developed system and the removal percentage of CHD obtained from the system was found to be quite appreciable. The results show that the recovery and reuse of the catalyst by the present system is very much significant. Meanwhile, the developed reactor can be operated in cross flow configuration under batch, semi-batch and continuous mode.

AB Anticancer drugs are currently widely used for the treatment of cancer and have been detected in hospital effluents, wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water samples in concentrations up to the mu g.L-1 range. Within the next two decades, the annual number of cancer cases is expected to rise, which will lead to an increase in the consumption of anticancer drugs. These drugs are extremely important due to their highly potent mechanism of action and their potential risk for humans and the environment. Therefore, the development of effective treatment options is crucial to avoid the release of these emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. The aim of this study was to assess the viability of nanofiltration for remediation, using as benchmark two representative membranes (Desal 5DK and NF270) to remove four widely consumed anticancer drugs (paclitaxel, etoposide, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide) from different matrices (laboratory grade water, synthetic urine and real secondary effluent). Experimental results showed that the Desal 5DK membrane is more effective than the NF270 membrane for the rejection of these compounds. It presented average rejections higher than 89% for all the target anticancer drugs spiked in synthetic urine and real secondary effluent, showing no significant matrix influence on the rejection results. Daphnia magna toxicity tests showed that the immobilization effect observed in the permeate samples was lower than the feed samples.
   The target compounds have very different structures and physico-chemical properties and thus the high effectiveness reported for the Desal 5DK membrane is a good indication of what can be expected to a multitude of compounds.

AB Sustainable and closed-loop nutrient cycling require the recovery of valuable resources from wastewater. Resource recovery from diluted wastewater streams is limited by diluted concentrations and unfavorable reaction kinetics. In comparison, source separated urine allows resource recovery from a highly concentrated nutrient stream, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient recovery practice. Different nutrient recovery methods from urine have been studied in lab-scale, but pilot or full-scale process evaluations remain sparse. In this study, recovery of struvite and ammonium sulfate from urine of pregnant women was demonstrated at a pilot-scale treatment facility by means of precipitation and air stripping/acid scrubbing. The system achieved 94% struvite precipitation efficiency but merely 55% of the crystals were removed and recovered. The low phosphorus recovery was due to the washout of small crystals that escaped the sieve and settling tank, hence requiring an improved method for crystals capture. The removal and recovery efficiencies for nitrogen were 93% and 85%, respectively. Composition analysis of the produced fertilizers indicated that struvite was the dominated precipitate and quality of the ammonium sulfate met European standards. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were added in the urine to measure the fate of pharmaceuticals in the treatment system. Very little of the spiked pharmaceuticals (<0.01%) accumulated in the produced struvite and ammonium sulfate. The overall energy demand of the pilot system was 1066 MJ per m(3) urine processed or 198 MJ per kg N removed. Energy efficiency was not optimized and can be improved in many ways.

AB Membrane filtration processes such as ultrafiltration are increasingly employed in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. However, these filtration processes are usually poor for removing low molecular weight organic and inorganic contaminants. Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF), where contaminants first partition into micellar phases prior to removal by ultrafiltration, has been shown to be an effective removal technique for a variety of trace contaminants in wastewater. To characterize or predict the removal efficiency of MEUF, it is important to have a quantitative measure of the extent to which a species is able to bind to a micelle as well as to develop an understanding of the dynamics of the binding interactions.
   Herein, we report micellar binding constants for a series of sulfonamide antibiotics (sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfacetamide, sulfaguanidine, and sulfanilamide) with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) micelles, as determined using a semi -equilibrium dialysis method. Sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole and sulfamethoxazole exhibited the strongest tendency to bind to CTABr micelles, indicating that they possessed greater potential for removal via MEUF than did sulfanilamide or sulfaguanidine, which displayed little affinity for binding with CTABr micelles.
   Linear free energy plots of LogK(B) (in CTABr) versus LogK(ow) and pK(a2) values indicated that there was a weak correlation between binding and LogK(ow) and a stronger correlation with pK(a2) for these compounds, likely reflecting the stronger binding of ionizable sulfonamide molecules in the anionic form by the cationic micelles.

AB Advanced treatment to remove trace constituents and emerging contaminants is an important consideration for wastewater treatment for potable reuse, and reverse osmosis (RO) can be a suitable technology to provide the necessary level of treatment. However, membrane fouling by biological and organic matter is a concern. This research examined the development of the RO membrane fouling layer using a bench-scale membrane bioreactor operating at different solids retention times (SRTs), followed by a custom-designed RO test cell. The RO test cell contained stacked plates that sandwich five sheets of RO membrane material, which can be extracted for autopsy at separate times over the course of an experiment without disturbing the remaining membranes. The MBR-RO system was run continuously for 2 weeks at each SRT. The RO membranes were stained for live and dead cells, protein, and carbohydrate-like materials, and visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Images of the stained foulant layers were obtained at different depths within the foulant layer at each time point for all SRT conditions. As the RO foulant layer developed, changes occurred in the distribution and morphology of the live cells and carbohydrates, but not the proteins. These trends were similar for all three SRT conditions tested. RO membrane fouling increased with increased MBR SRT, and the highest SRT had the highest ratios of live to dead cells and carbohydrate-like material to dead cells. The autopsied membranes were also analyzed for protein and carbohydrate content, and it was found that the carbohydrate concentration on the membranes after 14 days increased as the SRT increased.

AB In this study, we critically examined the available data related to pharmaceutical (PhAC) sorption in biological treatment processes. Using these data, we developed and assessed single and polyparameter quantitative structural activity models to better understand the role of sorption in PhAC attenuation. In contrast to other studies, our analysis suggests that values of the sorption coefficient (K-D) are poorly correlated to single parameter models employing log K-OW or the apparent partition coefficient (i.e., K-OW corrected to the experimental pH). Results from the development of polyparameter models suggest that the range of functional moieties typically incorporated in PhAC molecules offers a diverse set of interactions between PhAC and sludge surface (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions). Of particular importance is the role of dissociation and resulting charge(s) of a PhAC in solution. Results demonstrate that when developing predictive models it is advantageous to separate PhACs based upon the charge of the dominant species at the experimental pH. Yet, use a single model for PhACs which are negatively charged and uncharged may have practical utility. Performance of the polyparameter models, however, was found to plateau with a pred-R-2 between 0.50 and 0.60, even when six statistically relevant predictors are included. This outcome suggests that effective predictive models for PhAC sorption cannot include solely PhAC descriptors, rather they must incorporate critical properties related to the sorbent (i.e., mixed liquor) surface.

AB This work aims to study derivative removal of gentamicin (GMC) antibiotic from the aqueous solution within photocatalytic process using a recyclable magnetic titania (MT) photocatalyst. The MT photocatalyst was synthesised, characterised, and utilised by using co-precipitating method. The process of modelling and optimisation was performed by a second-order polynomial model. The 'F-value' of 432.56 and 'P-value' of 0.0001 indicated that the proposed model could be used for simulating the gentamicin photocatalytic removal process. According to the model prediction, the process could remove GMC antibiotic up to 94.7% in the optimum conditions (initial pH = 6.9, [GMC] = 20 ppm, MT dosage = 195 mg/L, and time = 63 min). Recycling and reusing potentials of the synthesised MT catalyst were studied in five cycles in the optimum conditions. According to the obtained results, in the first stage of catalyst recycling, the removal efficiency decreased by about 12%, but in the subsequent stages, the removal efficiency reduction was lower than the first step and about 5%. Mineralisation of the 51.3% efficiency was obtained in the optimum conditions. Kinetic study results showed that the data were well fitted by pseudo-first-order kinetic model with the regression coefficient of 0.9769. Also, the related reaction rate constant was 0.041 min(-1). The effect of sulphate and chloride ions, as radical scavengers, on the removal efficiency demonstrated a reduction in GMC removal efficiency, which occurred by using chloride and sulphate ions. The results represented applying MT for treating real wastewater could remove GMC antibiotic in hospital wastewater up to 91.21%, too.

AB N-nitrosamines are contaminants of emerging concern, and controlling these chemicals in potable water and recycled water for potable reuse has become important for protecting public health. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of the alkyl chain lengths of N-nitrosamine precursors (secondary and tertiary amines) on the formation of N-nitrosamines via chloramination. The molar conversion efficiency from dimethylamine, an N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursor, to NDMA (0.67%) was greater than that from diethylamine, an N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) precursor, to NDEA (0.38%). Similarly, the molar conversion efficiency from trimethylamine to NDMA (0.92%) was greater than from triethylamine to NDEA (0.33%). Interestingly, a considerable difference in molar conversion efficiencies were observed for tertiary amines with the N,N-dialkyla-arylamine structure: the molar conversion efficiencies from N,N-dimethylbenzylamine and N,N-diethylbenzylamine to NDMA and NDEA were 50.2% and 1.7%, respectively. These results indicate that amines with ethyl groups have lower potentials for producing the corresponding N-nitrosamines than those with methyl groups. These differences in yields between amines with methyl and ethyl groups can be explained by the difference in electron density in the nitrogen atom of the amine, which influences the protonation of the amine and stabilization of intermediate species. These findings could be useful for enhancing source control of water and wastewater by regulating runoff or industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of specific N-nitrosamine precursors.

AB The main objective of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance (AR) levels in wastewater (WW) and the impact on the receiving river. Samples were collected once per season over one year in the WW of a hospital, in the raw and treated WW of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as upstream and downstream from the release of WWTPs effluents into the Zenne River (Belgium). Culture dependent methods were used to quantify Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were quantified in both particle-attached (PAB) and free-living (FLB) bacteria. Our results showed that WWTPs efficiently removed antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) regardless of its AR profile. The ARGs levels were the highest in the hospital WW and were significantly reduced in both WWTP5. However, ARB and ARGs abundances significantly increased into the Zenne River downstream from the WWTPs outfalls. The variation in the relative abundance of ARGs through WW treatment differed depending on the WWTP, fraction, and gene considered. The sun and sul2 genes in PAB fraction showed significantly higher relative abundances in the effluent compared to the influent of both WWTP5. This study demonstrated that WWTPs could be hotspots for AR spread with significant impacts on receiving freshwater ecosystems. This was the first comprehensive study investigating at the same time antibiotics occurrence, fecal bacteria indicators, heterotrophic bacterial communities, and ARGs (distinguishing PAB and FLB) to assess AR levels in WW and impacts on the receiving river.

AB While heterotrophic microorganisms constitute the major fraction of activated sludge biomass, the role of heterotrophs in the biotransformation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) has not been fully elucidated. Yet, such knowledge is essential, particularly when conceiving novel wastewater treatment plants based on a two-stage process including an A-stage under heterotrophic conditions and a B-stage based on anammox activity. Biotransformation of OMPs in activated sludge is thought to mostly occur cometabolically thanks to the action of low specificity enzymes involved in the metabolism of the primary substrates. For a better understanding of the process, it is important to determine such enzymatic activities and the underlying mechanisms involved in OMPs biotransformation. This task has proven to be difficult due to the lack of information about the enzymatic processes and the complexity of the biological systems present in activated sludge. In this paper, a continuous aerobic heterotrophic reactor following 20 OMPs at environmental concentrations was operated to (i) assess the potential of heterotrophs during the cometabolic biotransformation of OMPs, (ii) identify biotransformation reactions catalyzed by aerobic heterotrophs and (iii) predict possible heterotrophic enzymatic activities responsible for such biotransformations. Contradicting previous reports on the dominant role of nitrifiers in OMPs removal during activated sludge treatment, the heterotrophic population proved its capacity to biotransform the OMPs to extents equivalent to reported values in nitrifying activated sludge plants. Besides, 12 transformation products potentially formed through the activity of several enzymes present in heterotrophs, including monooxygenases, dioxygenases, hydrolases and transferases, were identified.

ID SELECTIVE SEPARATION; (S)-AMLODIPINE; ENANTIOMERS; RESOLUTION; ACID
AB A novel method was developed for the recovery and enantioseparation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (S)-amlodipine from pharmaceutical wastewater: hollow fiber membrane extraction and in situ coupling of back-extraction with crystallization. Amlodipine (AD) was extracted from wastewater (W) into an extraction phase (O-1) by a commercial extractant P507 (2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) and subsequently back-extracted into a stripping phase (O-2), in which (S)-amlodipine was preferentially crystallized in situ with a chiral resolving agent (D)-tartaric acid. To establish such a coupling system, n-heptane and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were selected as the solvents of O-1 and O-2, so O-1 can be immiscible with both W and O-2, and crystallization can also occur in O-2. The acidic extractant P507 was selected to transfer amlodipine from W to O-2 because amlodipine is a basic molecule. The hollow fiber membrane module was employed as an extraction contactor to avoid the entrainment of droplets and crystalline powders. The effects of the running time, amlodipine concentration, pH, P507 concentration, flow rate, (D)-tartaric acid concentration, DMSO dosage, number of fibers, and temperature were investigated. An ee ((S) - AD )of 90.7 +/- 1.4% and a yield (Y (S) - AD) of 48.8 +/- 2.4% for the crystal product were obtained under optimized conditions. The crystal products were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography and scanning electron microscopy. In this new technology, all reagents were inexpensive chemicals, and membrane extraction was coupled with crystallization for both high enrichment ability and good enantioseparation ability. This technology has application prospect for the recycling of many high-value chiral drugs.

AB Trash fish feeding of cage fish can result in marine pollution. Whole and chopped trash fish can leach pollutants such as ammonia, phosphate and protein into surrounding waters. Reduction of pollution can be achieved by recycling the wastewater generated from trash fish feeding for cultivation of microalgae. Microalgae are potent candidates for the production of renewable and sustainable products such as feed and food, health and pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, industrial products, and biofuel. Two microalgae, Chlorella saccharophila and Nannochloropsis sp., have the potential to produce high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, high oil content ranging from 10.7 to 13.6% is found in Chlorella saccharophila and up to 9.3% for Nannochloropsis sp. Moreover, these microalgae can also be utilized as a biofuel to give a mean calorific value of 5364 Cal/g which is higher than that of wood for Chlorella saccharophila and 6132 Cal/g which is equivalent to that of coal for Nannochloropsis sp. An alternative biofuel derived from microalgae is feasible due to the fact that they do not compete for arable land for cultivation and land crops for feed and food. This study discusses the synergistic coupling of microalgae mass production with wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration potential for mitigation of environmental impacts and a technically viable alternative energy resource. Additionally, the de-oiled biomass byproduct after oil extraction or its whole biomass can be converted into sustainable and renewal industrial products such as bioplastic, biopaint, bioasphalt, and biobuilding components.

AB In the biofilm wastewater treatment process, the start-up period of biofilm process is affected by the biofilm formation on the surface of carriers. Controlling surface charge property of carriers could accelerate the biofilm formation. The surface of conventional biofilm carriers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is negatively charged, as is the surface of bacterial cells of activated sludge, which could lead to electrostatic repulsion between the biofilm carriers and the bacteria. Herein, the conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE) carriers were modified by two kinds of positively charged polymers with different charge strength, which were noted as polyquaternium-10 (PQAS-10) and cationicpolyacrylamides (CPAM), respectively, to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based wastewater treatment process. The results showed that the positive Zeta potential was measured on the surface of modified carriers, whereas the surface Zeta potential of unmodified carriers was negative. It indicated that the modified carriers carried positive charge. Furthermore, the positive charge on the modified PQAS-10 carriers was higher than that on the modified CPAM carriers. The reactor with modified PQAS-10 carriers achieved shorter reactor start-up time and higher attached biomass compared to that with unmodified carriers and modified CPAM carriers. As a result, the removal efficiencies of COD, NH4+-N and TN in the reactor with the modified carriers were higher than that with the unmodified carriers. These findings demonstrated that the success of electrophilic modification on the surface of carriers was expected to accelerate the startup of biofilm-based reactors and improve the reactor performance in the practical application.

AB A full-scale hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system based on three stages of different wetlands configurations showed to be a very robust ecotechnology for domestic wastewater treatment and reuse in small communities. It consisted of a 317-m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF), a 229-m(2) horizontal subsurface flow (HF), and a 240-m(2) free water surface (FWS) CWs operating in series. VF and HF wetlands were planted with Phragmites australis and the FWS contained a mixture of plant species. An excellent overall treatment performance was exhibited on the elimination of conventional water quality parameters (98-99% average removal efficiency for TSS, BOD5 and NH4-N; n = 8), and its final effluent proved to comply with existing Spanish regulations for various reuse applications. The removal of studied emerging contaminants, which included various pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disruptors, was also very high (above 80% for all compounds), being compound dependent (n = 8). The high rates were achieved due to high temperatures as well as the differing existing physico-chemical conditions occurring at different CW configurations, which would allow for the combination and synergy of various abiotic/biotic removal mechanisms to occur (e.g. biodegradation, sorption, volatilization, hydrolysis, photodegradation). While aerobic metabolic pathways and solids retention are enhanced in the VF bed, other removal mechanisms such as anaerobic biodegradation and sorption would predominate in the HF bed. At last, photodegradation through direct sunlight exposure, and less importantly, sorption onto organic matter, seem to take an active part in organic contaminant removal in the FWS wetland.

AB Enantiomeric compositions of three 2-arylpropionic acid (2-APA) drugs, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen, were monitored in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating municipal effluent in a small rural town in Australia. Specific enantiomers were determined as amide diastereomers using the chiral derivatizing reagent, (R)-1-phenylethylamine (PEA), followed by gas chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The six individual enantiomers were quantified by isotope dilution and the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) were determined. Over four separate sampling events, ibuprofen EF ranged from 0.88 to 0.94 (median 0.93) in the influent and 0.38 to 0.40 (median 0.39) in the effluent. However, no significant change in ketoprofen EF was observed, with influent EFs of 0.560.60 (median 0.58) and effluent EFs 0.540.68 (median 0.56). This is the first report of enantiospecific analysis of ketoprofen in municipal wastewater and it is not yet clear why such different behavior was observed compared to ibuprofen. Naproxen EF was consistently measured at 0.99 in the influent and ranged from 0.86 to 0.94 (median 0.91) in the effluent. This study demonstrates that EF is a relatively stable parameter and does not fluctuate according to concentration or other short-term variables introduced by sampling limitations. The enantiospecific analysis of chiral chemicals presents a promising approach to elucidate a more thorough understanding of biological treatment processes and a potential tool for monitoring the performance of key biological pathways.

AB The stability of 24 chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and some agrochemicals on extraction media was evaluated by preloading them onto Oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) followed by storage at 20 degrees C over time. After 20 months, the average loss was 11% on POCIS, with only 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and gemfibrozil showing a statistically significant decline compared with initial concentrations. Losses on SPE cartridges were below 19%, with an average loss of 9%. In addition to laboratory spiked samples, multiple POCIS deployed in wastewater-impacted surface waters and SPE extracts of these waters were stored in their original coextracted matrix for nearly two years with minimal observed losses. Errors from typical sampling, handling, and concentration estimates from POCIS sampling rates were typically +/- 15 to 30% relative standard deviation, so observed storage losses are minimal for most POCIS applications. While losses during storage on SPE cartridges for 20 months were small but statistically significant for many compounds, addition of labeled internal standards prior to freezing should correct for such losses. Thus, storage of processed water samples for analysis of polar organic pollutants is viable for archival purposes or studies for which samples cannot be analyzed in the short term. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Co-crystallization frequently employs forces such as hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and pi-pi stacking to assemble molecules in a multi-component crystal. In an effort to increase the strength of the intermolecular interaction between the anti-cholesterol drug bezafibrate (BEZA), a wastewater contaminant, and hydrogen-bond-acceptor molecules, we modified the pK(a) values of the acceptors. Here, we describe the first series of salts incorporating BEZA and achieve a variety of supramolecular architectures including discrete assemblies, 1D chains, tapes, and 2D sheets. We discuss exceptions to the pK(a) rule, and demonstrate that the presence of hydrogen-bond-donor atoms on the acceptor molecule supports salt formation.

AB Tetracycline (TC), one of the most common antibiotics, is often poorly bio-degraded in conventional wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the sonocatalytic degradation of TC was investigated using TiO2 nano-particles as catalyst. The effect of pH, initial TC concentrations, reaction times, and H2O2 concentrations were evaluated. The efficacy of ultrasonic irradiation alone in the removal of this pollutant was negligible but removal efficiency increased upon addition of TiO2 up to 250mg L-1; increase of pH and initial TC concentration attenuated TC degradation. Addition of H2O2 raised the removal efficiency so that complete removal of TC was achieved within 75min.

AB The presence of estrogens in the environment and their effects especially on reproductive health on aquatic animals and on humans has become a subject of growing concern worldwide. This paper describes the preliminary data and tests performed in order to obtain and optimize a new gas chromatographic method for the identification of the most common found estrogen in the environment, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. For this purpose, a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector and a chromatographic column DB-5MS has been used and the specific parameters have been optimized. The developed analytical method was then tested on two types of water (waste water and surface water). The processing of samples followed several steps, involving liquid-liquid extraction, concentration, purification and derivatization. The linearity range of the method has been established between 0.025 - 0.100 mu g/L. The recovery for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol fortified water samples reached 85.30 %.

AB Agitated thin-film dryers (ATFDs) are used to produce dry free-flowing powder from slurry/solution-type feed and widely implemented in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries. The feed passes through the ATFD in several forms such as solution/slurry and successively becomes paste, wet powder, and dry powder. The flow of feed in the ATFD undergoes a helical path (combination of rotational velocity imparted by the agitator/blade and axial velocity of feed) while flowing through the annular part of the dryer. The ATFD is described stage-wise and the parameters such as physical properties, scraped surface heat transfer coefficient, and evaporation rate (drying rate) are derived using stepwise model equations. The penetration theory is modeled to obtain the scraped-side heat transfer coefficient. The model equations were solved using MATLAB 7 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and the simulated drying rate was consequently validated with the experimental values.

AB This work investigates, for the first time, the occurrence and sources of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water of Beijing, one of most densely populated cities in the world, in three sampling events representing different seasonal flow conditions. The detection frequencies of most PPCPs were in the range of 50-100%. The median concentrations of the selected PPCPs ranged from not detected to 4200 ng L-1 (caffeine). Generally, higher PPCP levels were observed in early spring, indicating both low flow condition and cold-water temperature might enhance their persistence. Source apportionment showed freshly discharged untreated sewage (67%) significantly contributed to the PPCP burden in the Beiyun River, which provides important information for environmental management.

DE Predicted environmental concentration; Multiphase model; Pharmaceuticals
ID TREATMENT PLANTS; WATER
AB A multiphase model based on the Mackay-type level II fugacity model has been used to predict the behaviour and final environmental concentrations of some of the more consumed pharmaceuticals in Spain. The model takes into account the mean rate of consumption of pharmaceuticals, the percentage of pharmaceutical metabolised, the formation of the corresponding glucuronide, which is assumed to be hydrolysed back to the parent molecule, the partial degradation of each pharmaceutical in a conventional sewage treatment plant, and the fate of these substances in a regional model environmental system. Predicted environmental concentrations in air, water, soil, sediments and suspended matter, and the corresponding residence time for each pharmaceutical have been obtained by application of the model. The predicted concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the water phase are of the same order than the measured experimentally, showing that the simple model used to predict the environmental concentrations is suitable for modelling the environmental fate of high water soluble and low volatile organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals products.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are regularly used by human being for their day to day life. These products contains various chemical compounds which are regularly added in our surface and ground water sources either through untreated or partially treated domestic and industrial wastes or through agricultural runoffs etc. These are present at the concentration of mu g liter-1, and at such low concentration also these have shown harmful affect to living being. A lot of studies have been carried out for studying their effects on animal biodiversity, which can directly or indirectly affect human being also. So their removal from waste water is essential. Various technologies are being tested for removing these compounds from polluted water; bioremediation is also one of them. Present chapter will briefly give the description of various PPCPs present in waste water, their impact and removal technologies available for their removal with special emphasis on bio remediation.

AB The biodegradation of selected pharmaceutical micropollutants, including two pharmaceuticals with argued biodegradation, was studied by a lab-scale membrane bioreactor. The reaction kinetics and affecting factors were also investigated in this paper. Clofibric acid (CA) with contradictive biodegradation reported was degraded almost completely at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) after adaptation to microorganisms. The biodegradation of CA was disturbed at low pH operation, while the activity of microorganisms recovered again after pH adjustment to neutral condition. Ibuprofen (IBP) degraded under neutral and acidic conditions. Removals of IBP and CA were zero-order and first-order reactions under high and low initial concentrations, respectively. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were not degraded regardless of HRTs and pH.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in waterbodies worldwide. Conventional sewage treatment plants are often not able to eliminate these micropollutants. Hence, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been heavily investigated. Here, metoprolol is exposed to UV irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and ozonation. Degradation was analyzed using chemical kinetics both for initial and secondary products. Photo-induced irradiation enhanced by hydrogen peroxide addition accelerated degradation more than ozonation, leading to complete elimination. Degradation and transformation products were identified by high-performance liquid-chromatography coupled to high-resolution higher-order mass spectrometry. The proposed structures allowed to apply Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis to predict ecotoxicity. Degradation products were generally associated with a lower ecotoxicological hazard to the aquatic environment according to OECD QSAR toolbox and VEGA. Comparison of potential structural isomers suggested forecasts may become more reliable with larger databases in the future.

AB A number of important rivers of Romania were investigated for pharmaceutical and antifungal residues. In a post target approach analysis, a single-stage, high-resolution mass spectrometry was successfully applied for the screening of 43 pharmaceuticals and fungicides in water, using U-HPLC-Exactive Orbitrap MS at 50,000 full width at half maximum resolution. Detection was based on accurate masses and retention times. The study confirmed the presence of pharmaceuticals and antifungals such as diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, thiabendazole, and clotrimazole, in water. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were the most frequently detected (eight samples); concentrations ranged from 5 to 50 ng L-1. Low concentrations of griseofulvin were detected in the Prut River. Further monitoring studies should be carried out in order to fill the gaps of knowledge concerning the presence of pharmaceutical residues in Romanian water environment and to improve public understanding regarding the environmental risk of pharmaceutical contamination.

AB The synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) has been increasingly detected in sewage effluents in the last two decades. The aim of the present study was determined if EE2 exposure adversely affected reproduction in internally fertilizing fish species Jenynsia multidentata. Sexual behavior, brain and gonadal aromatase expression as well as sperm quality were evaluated. The brain aromatase expression, reproductive behavior, spermatozoa viability and gonadosomatic index were sensitive biomarkers of EE2 effects on this species. The condition factor, hepatosomatic index, gonadal aromatase expression, sperm count and sperm velocities were unaltered after EE2 exposure. The present work highlights the importance of using a combination of several biomarkers to study the effects of estrogenic compounds, especially when trying to link these results to potential population-level effects.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are found in secondary treated effluents up to mu g L(-1) levels and therefore discharged into surface waters Since the long term effects of these compounds on the environment and human health are, to date, largely unknown, implementation of advanced treatment of wastewaters is envisaged to reduce their discharge This is of particular relevance where surface waters are used as drinking water sources and when considering indirect potable reuse. This study aimed at assessing the removal of organic micropollutants and the concurrent reduction of their biological activity in a full scale reclamation plant treating secondary effluent The treatment consists of 6 stages denitrification, pre-ozonation, coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation and filtration (DAFF), main ozonation, activated carbon filtration and final ozonation for disinfection. For that purpose, representative 24-hour composite samples were collected after each stage The occurrence of 85 compounds was monitored by LC/MS-MS A battery of 6 bioassays was also used as a complementary tool to evaluate non-specific toxicity and 5 specific toxic modes of action. Results show that, among the 54 micropollutants; quantified in the influent water, 50 were removed to below their limit of quantification representing more than 90% of concentration reduction Biological activity was reduced, depending on the specific response that was assessed, from a minimum of 62% (AhR response) to more than 99% (estrogenicity) The key processes responsible for the plant's performances were the coagulation/flocculation/DAFF, main ozonation and activated carbon filtration The effect of these 3 processes varied from one compound or bioassay to another but their combination was almost totally responsible for the overall observed reduction Bioassays yielded complementary information, e g estrogenic compounds were not detected in the secondary effluent by chemical analysis, but the samples had an estrogenic effect. The main ozonation formed oxidation by-products of the organic micropollutants but decreased the level of non-specific toxicity and other specific toxic modes of action, demonstrating that the mixture of oxidation by-products was less potent than the mixture of the parent compounds for the considered effects (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Carbamazepine and diclofenac were frequently detected in water bodies. In this study, crude lignin peroxidase, produced from a white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was studied on its in vitro degradation of both drugs. The influencing parameters were studied, including pH, the hydrogen peroxide concentration, veratryl alcohol and the temperature. It was found that UP completely degraded diclofenac at pH 3.0-4.5 and 3-24 ppm H2O2 while the degradation efficiency of carbamazepine was mostly below 10%. The addition of veratryl alcohol and the increased temperature did not enhance the degradation of carbamazepine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation is one of the most promising options to remove organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant effluents. For an economic operation and in order to avoid formation of bromate, the ozone dose has to be adjusted in real-time due to the strongly varying effluent quality. The reduction of UV absorption at 254nm (UV254) is a useful surrogate parameter for OMP removals. Unfortunately dissolved ozone also absorbs UV at 254nm and therefore might disturb a UV254-based process control. A fixed bed of manganese dioxide granules was found to efficiently remove residual ozone.

AB The occurrence of 18 commonly used pharmaceuticals was investigated in an agricultural area, which is primarily affected by runoff from agricultural fields and septic systems, on the coastline of Maumee Bay, within the western Lake Erie basin. Selected pharmaceuticals were detected in surface water, except clofibric acid and fluoxethine. The most frequently detected compounds were caffeine (88%), carbamazepine (57%) and paraxanthine (56%). Caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and paraxanthine were detected with maximum concentrations of 4.2, 1.2, 2.8 and 1.8 mu g L-1, respectively. However, no compound was detected in any sediment samples. In a field receiving biosolids application, pharmaceuticals were detected in the field tile drainage following biosolids application but not in soil. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water can be linked to the use of septic systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel double templates-molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared by precipitation polymerization using carbamazepine (CBZ) and clofibric acid (CA) as the double templates molecular and 2-vinylpyridine as functional monomer. The equilibrium data of MIP was well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. Two kinetic models were adopted to describe the experimental data, and the pseudo second-order model well-described adsorption of CBZ and CA on the MIP. Adsorption experimental results showed that the MIP had good selectivity and adsorption capacity for CBZ and CA in the presence of competitive compounds compared with non-imprinted polymer, commercial powdered activated carbon, and C18 adsorbents. The feasibility of removing CBZ and CA from water by the MIP was demonstrated using tap water, lake water, and river water.

AB The present study aims to investigate the efficiency of on-site produced ferrate(VI) for drinking water treatment as well as for the removal of micro pollutants. The study examined and validated the laboratory electrochemical production of ferrate(VI) and tested water treatment efficiency of the resulting ferrate(VI) in comparison with that of FeClSO4 and poly-aluminium chloride (PACl). The performance of water treatment was compared by the removal efficiency of turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, microbial count and trace organic micro pollutants. Major observations were that 0.5mg/L of ferrate(VI) as Fe was sufficient to remove most of the contaminants and achieve complete disinfection irrespective of the original microbial counts. Ferrate(VI) has considerable oxidation potential to degrade commonly occurring trace organic micropollutants (other than melamine) in the Danube River water. In contrast, FeClSO4 or PACl cannot remove any trace micro pollutants.

AB In the present paper an experimental study regarding the selectivity upon the separation process of salicylic acid from 5-aminosalicylic acid using the technique of bulk liquid membranes is presented. The optimal separation parameters were established based upon the experimental results obtained at the study of the feed phase pH influence upon the efficiency of the two compounds transport. These results can be closely correlated with the distribution diagram of chemical species in solution depending on the pH. When using a feed phase at pH similar to 2 and a receiving phase at pH similar to 12 the separation of salicylic acid through a chloroform membrane with efficiency higher than 80%, at a transport time of 3 h, was realized. The recovery degree from a mixture of salicylic acid and 5-aminosalicylic acid is over 90 %.

AB Pharmaceutics present in the environment are of growing concern for their potential consequences on human and ecosystem health. In long-term monitoring investigations of sewage and surface water samples, diclofenac was identified as one of the most important pharmaceutically active compounds. Pangasius sp. were exposed to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) of diclofenac. The histopathological studies in a fish hepatopancreas sample showed significant changes like nucleation, differentiation, and hepatocytes. The large lesions and infiltration in hepatocytes were distinctly seen due to the toxic effect of diclofenac. In HPLC analysis, the control fish liver tissue showed no significant changes, whereas the diclofenac-exposed fish liver tissue showed a significant peak with a quicker run time. The studies confirmed that the diclofenac compound affects hepatocytes to a noteworthy extent. Therefore, this calls for reduction of diclofenac usage and also to have a checkpoint especially for diclofenac in the pharmaceutical effluent released into the water bodies.

AB A rapidly expanding field of on-line process monitoring and on-line control in biotechnology, food industry, pharmaceutical industry, process chemistry, environmental measuring technology, water treatment and sewage processing requires the development of new micro fabricated reliable chemical and biosensors that are specific for particular species and can attain the analytic information in a faster, simpler and cheaper manner. Using a functionalised hydrogel coating in sensors provides the possibility to detect, transmit and record the information regarding the concentration change or the presence of a specific analyte (a chemical or biological substance that needs to be measured) by producing a signal proportional to the concentration of the target analyte. In this chapter, we describe piezoresistive chemical microsensors for a comprehensive characterization of solutions, which could be embedded inside fluidic systems for real time monitoring of organic and inorganic contaminants.

AB Probably the only thing that can be said with certainty about the future of this field of ecotoxicology is that predicting it is foolish; the chances of being right are very slim. Instead, it seems to me likely that unexpected discoveries will probably have more influence on the field of endocrine disruption than the outcomes of all the planned experiments. It is certainly true that chance discoveries, such as masculinized fish in rivers receiving paper-mill effluent, imposex in molluscs due to exposure to tributyltin, and feminized fish in rivers receiving effluent from sewage-treatment works, have been pivotal in the development of the field of endocrine disruption in wildlife. I consider that further such discoveries are likely, but I do not know which species will be affected, what effects will be found, what chemical(s) will be the cause, or what endocrine mechanism(s) will underlie the effects. The recent realization that many pharmaceuticals are present in the aquatic environment only underscores the range of effects that could, in theory at least, occur in exposed wildlife. What is somewhat easier to predict is the research that will be conducted in the immediate future, which will build upon what is known already. For example, it is clear that wildlife is rarely, if ever, exposed to single chemicals, but instead is exposed to highly complex, ill-defined mixtures of chemicals, including many that are endocrine active in various ways. We need to understand much better how chemicals interact, and what overall effects will occur upon exposure to such mixtures. We also need to move from assessing effects at the individual organism level, to understanding the consequences of these effects at the population level. Then, we need to determine the significance of any population-level effects due to endocrine disruption in comparison with the impact of many other significant stressors (e.g., over-exploitation, habitat loss, climate change) that also negatively impact wildlife. Such research will be difficult, and time-consuming, and will probably produce many surprises. All I can be fairly certain about is that the next few years are likely to be as interesting and exciting as the last few have been.

AB A large number of antibiotic residues are discharged into aquatic environments due to the widespread use of antibiotics in daily life. After a series of processes in the water, the residues will potentially have adverse impacts on water ecosystem and human health. Therefore, it is critical for mediating the pollution to know how the antibiotics transport and distribute in the water. This study utilizes a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model to find out the transport and distribution of antibiotics in a highly polluted area, the Laizhou Bay in China. Furthermore, the model was used to simulate two scenarios in the Laizhou Bay, the antibiotics from sewage treatment plants and the contamination of mariculture. The simulated results show that the model as an effective tool can provide a useful basis for the management of antibiotics-related environmental issues in the Laizhou Bay.

AB Microbial pollution of recreational waters poses a significant public health risk which, unless mitigated, will continue to increase with population growth. Water managers must implement strategies to accurately discriminate and source human from animal faecal contamination in complex urbanised environments. Our case-study used a new combination of chemical (i.e. ammonia) and microbial (i.e. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp.) faecal monitoring tools in a targeted multi-tiered approach to quickly identify pollution hot-spots and track high-risk subterranean stormwater drains in real-time. We successfully located three point sources of human faecal pollution (both episodic and constant pollution streams) within 11 catchments in a total monitoring time of four months. Alternative approaches for obtaining such fine-scale accuracy are typically labour intensive and require expensive equipment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The overall objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of tailored activated carbons in the adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA). The results indicated that the experimental data were well described with pseudo second-order kinetic model. Activated carbon samples (F600-A and OLC-A) tailored with acidic treatment processed better adsorption rates, and the adsorption rates D reached 46.512 and 46.083 mg/g h, respectively. In addition, the roles of water parameters were also investigated. BPA adsorption rate was reduced with increasing pH because of an increase in electrostatic repulsion and a decrease in hydrogen bond interactions. It was found that the adsorbed amount of BPA increased with the increase of temperature from 288 to 318 K. Finally, ionic strength was found to play an important role in promoting BPA adsorption rate by increasing pi-pi dispersion interaction.

AB The applicability of blue light-emitting diode (LED, lambda = 465 nm) as the light source for environmental remediation by photocatalyst Bi2MoO6 was investigated. Two target compounds, phenol and ibuprofen (IBP), were selected as the model pollutants to evaluate the photocatalytic activities. The photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was also conducted to check the feasibility of using blue LED as the light source for the disinfection of bacteria. The results showed that efficient elimination of phenol and IBP and inactivation of E. coli were realized under a 3 W blue LED in the presence of Bi2MoO6. This demonstrates that LED is a competitive and promising alternative light source for the application in environmental remediation because the electrical energy consumption of LED decreased dramatically compared with other light source.

AB An extensive and comprehensive literature review has been conducted for compounds which we hypothesise could be present in sludge and maintain their integrity following application to agricultural land. The following compounds have been selected for review; chlorinated paraffins, quintozene, brominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated naphthalenes, polydimethylsiloxanes, chloronitrobenzenes and a range of biologically active and pharmaceutical compounds. All have received interest as a result of their persistence and/or toxicity in environmental media. Physicochemical property information has also been compiled and/or calculated. In this way, an accompanying paper will attempt to predict compound fate in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and assess likely transfers from soil/plants to grazing livestock. These papers describe a first attempt to predict the fate of these classes of compounds in the environment and prioritise those of greatest concern. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), Ibuprofen (IBU) and Bezafibrate (BEZ) were tested for their potential to bioaccumulate and provoke molecular changes in the non-target organism Dreissena polymorpha. mRNA changes of enzymes and other proteins involved in the prevention from protein damage (heat shock protein 70, hsp70) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; metallothionein, MT), biotransformation (pi-class glutathione S-transferase, piGST; aryl hydrocarbon receptor, AH-R), elimination (P-glycoprotein, P-gp) and reversible protein posttranslational modification (protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A) served as molecular biomarkers. Mussels were exposed in a flow-through system to increasing concentrations of the three substances (1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM). The two lower concentrations correspond to environmentally relevant concentrations detected in surface and effluent waters, respectively. Measuring tissue concentration after one, four and seven days the uptake of CBZ and IBU by the mussels could be evidenced, whereas no accumulation data could be achieved for BEZ. The bioconcentration factor was highest for mussels exposed to the lowest CBZ and IBU concentrations, with 90 and 460-fold higher tissue concentration, respectively, after seven days. CBZ was the only substance tested which caused a significant increase in gill mRNA level of hsp70 after only one day exposure, evidencing the potential of CBZ to immediately provoke a stress condition and assumingly protein damage in gills. After longer exposure, mussels displayed down-regulated mRNA levels of hsp70 and SOD in gills, as well as of MT and P-gp in the digestive gland, hinting on an inhibitory character of CBZ. In IBU exposed mussels increased oxidant stress conditions were evidenced by induced mRNA levels in the digestive gland of CAT and MT, as well as SOD after one and four days, respectively. A concentration as found at sewage treatment plant effluents provoked an increase in transcript levels of piGST, suggesting enhanced need for biotransformation of IBU or by-products derived from oxidative stress. Also exposure to an environmentally relevant BEZ concentration provoked an immediate increase in piGST transcript level in the digestive gland followed by up-regulated hsp70 after four and seven days evidencing a chronic stress condition for the mussels.

AB A sensitive method for the determination of fluoroquinolones in surface waters at trace concentration level is presented. The proposed two-step methodology consists in a solid-phase extraction using C-18 membranes followed measurement of the emission molecular fluorescence spectra over extracted membrane without elution of the analytes. Membrane background signal was removed by the used of chemometrics calculations, in addition chemometrics was as well used for the direct and simultaneous determination of the studied compounds. The method was optimized for the analysis of three fluoroquinolones: enoxacin (ENO), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFLO). The fluorescence of these compounds increase drastically when they are in the membrane, thus with this method low concentrations are possible to be determined, as the concentration in which these compounds appear in surface water. Limits of detection at the ngaEuro cent L-1 level were estimated for ENO, NOR and OFLO.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption and degradation of six antibiotics including Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Tetracycline (TC), Doxycycline (DTC), Sulfamethazine (SMZ), Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Clindamycin (CLD) in an aerobically digested biosolid. In the sorption experiment, CIP, TC, and DTC sorbed strongly, followed by CLD, while SMZ and SMX were only weakly sorbed to particles. An adsorption/desorption hysteresis was observed for nearly all the antibiotics to some extent. In the degradation experiment, the elimination of antibiotics, except CIP for which no degradation was observed, was found primarily attributed to biological degradation. For the degradation of TC, DTC, and CLD, a stable phase was achieved after preliminary degradation. We hypothesize that the nondegradable residuals are nondesorbable portions of sorbed antibiotics. From the results, other than SMX, all tested antibiotics can potentially survive biosolids storage periods and can be introduced into the environment following biosolids land application.

AB Analytical procedures for the determination of pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups were proposed. These groups included the corticosteroids prednisolone and dexamethasone; the beta-blockers sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol, and carvedilol; and the analgesic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs paracetamol, aspirin, metamizole, and ketoprofen. Reversed-phase ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector, different columns, different mobile phases, and gradient elution programmes were used to obtain the best separations within the shortest possible time. Solid-phase extraction was examined as a preconcentration step. The Oasis HLB column, with the highest recoveries (over 90% for most of the drugs), was chosen for the analysis of surface waters. Limits of detection ranged from 0.06 to 0.39 mu g L(-1) for all drugs after optimisation of all analytical steps.

AB In this study, the widely used anaerobic digestion model (ADMI) was used in order to simulate the inhibition of three pharmaceuticals, propranolol hydrochloride, ofloxacin and diclofenac sodium, on two groups of microorganisms, acetogens and acetoclastic methanogens, the most sensitive microorganisms groups involved in the anaerobic digestion process. The specific maximum consumption rate and saturation constant of acetate and propionate degraders were estimated through fitting the model to experimental data taken from continuous and batch experiments. A modified non-competitive inhibition function was used, and the inhibition constants were estimated using data from Batch experiments conducted at various concentrations of pharmaceuticals using enriched cultures with propionate and acetate degraders. It was found that propranolol hydrochloride was the most inhibitory pharmaceutical to both microorganisms groups. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The electrochemical behaviour of acidic and neutral pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) was studied by cyclic voltammetry and pulse voltammetric techniques on mercury, carbon nanotube paste, carbon paste and gold electrodes. The best results, in terms of sensitivity, linearity range and detection limits, were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) for ofloxacin (LOD 5.2 mu M), differential pulse polarography (DPP) for clofibric acid (LOD 4.7 mu M) and normal pulse voltammetry (NPV) for diclofenac (LOD 0.8 mu M) and propranolol (LOD 0.5 mu M).
   An enrichment step of approximately two orders of magnitude was performed by a solid-phase extraction procedure (SPE) in order to concentrate the samples. The developed method was optimized and tested on spiked river water samples. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment as a result of human and veterinary use, posing relevant environmental concerns. This study evaluated the acute toxicity of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate, and clofibric acid) and a detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS) in three aquatic species, namely the euryhaline fish Gambusia holbrooki, the hypersaline crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica, and the marine algae Tetraselmis chuii. The ranking of 50% lethal concentrations (LC50) for the two animal species and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the algal species was, in decreasing order, clofibric acid > SDS > diazepam > clofibrate for G. holbrooki, clofibric acid > clofibrate > SDS > diazepam for A. parthenogenetica, and clofibric acid > clofibrate > SDS > diazepam for T. chuii. These differences show that the intrinsic nature of test organisms must be considered when evaluating the toxicity of these agents to aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An environmental assessment is presented for the 25 most used pharmaceuticals in the National Health Service (NHS) in England in 2000. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the aquatic environment were calculated using conservative assumptions and all PECs exceeded 1 ng l(-1). The calculation of predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) based on aquatic toxicity data from the literature was possible for eleven of the pharmaceuticals. PNECs were predicted with ECOSAR for 12 of the remaining 14 but no data was available for two of the compounds. The PEC/PNEC ratio exceeded one for Paracetamol, Amoxycillin, Oxytetracycline and Mefenamic acid. Comparisons of the predicted concentrations of the compounds in sewage sludge based on either calculated sludge-water coefficients (K-d), octanol water coefficients (K-ow), acid base constants (pKa) or environmental modelling revealed large variations. No toxicity data was available for the terrestrial environment and no assessment was made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A first review on occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is presented. The literature survey conducted here was initiated by the current Assessment of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). This first review on the occurrence and environmental profile of PPCPs in the Arctic identified the presence of 110 related substances in the Arctic environment based on the reports from scientific publications, national and regional assessments and surveys, as well as academic research studies (i.e., PhD theses). PPCP residues were reported in virtually all environmental compartments from coastal seawater to high trophic level biota. For Arctic environments, domestic and municipal wastes as well as sewage are identified as primary release sources. However, the absence of modern waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), even in larger settlements in the Arctic, is resulting in relatively high release rates for selected PPCPs into the receiving Arctic (mainly) aquatic environment. Pharmaceuticals are designed with specific biochemical functions as a part of an integrated therapeutically procedure. This biochemical effect may cause unwanted environmental toxicological effects on non-target organisms when the compound is released into the environment. In the Arctic environments, pharmaceutical residues are released into low to very low ambient temperatures mainly into aqueous environments. Low biodegradability and, thus, prolonged residence time must be expected for the majority of the pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic system. The environmental toxicological consequence of the continuous PPCP release is, thus, expected to be different in the Arctic compared to the temperate regions of the globe. Exposure risks for Arctic human populations due to consumption of contaminated local fish and invertebrates or through exposure to resistant microbial communities cannot be excluded. However, the scientific results reported and summarized here, published in 23 relevant papers and reports (see Table S1 and following references), must still be considered as indication only. Comprehensive environmental studies on the fate, environmental toxicology, and distribution profiles of pharmaceuticals applied in high volumes and released into the Nordic environment under cold Northern climate conditions should be given high priority by national and international authorities.

AB This study presents a simple electrochemical approach for preparing a poly(l-serine) film-modified glassy carbon electrode, which responds quickly and sensitively during the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and ofloxacin in prepared, environmental, and pharmaceutical samples. The prepared electrode exhibited catalytic activities and promoted the oxidation of acetaminophen and ofloxacin. Acetaminophen and ofloxacin showed linear responses between 1.0 x 10(-5) and 1.0 x 10(-4) mol/L and their limits of detection were 1.2 x 10(-7) and 1.6 x 10(-7) mol/L, respectively. The average recoveries (+/- relative standard deviations) of acetaminophen and ofloxacin were 96.8 +/- A 3.5 % and 97.6 +/- A 3.2 %, respectively, indicating that the prepared electrode and detection method are very accurate and reproducible for the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and ofloxacin.

AB The present work deals with the photocatalytic degradation of Diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, using different commercial titania (P25, P90, C-TiO2) photocatalysts without and with Platinum as the co-catalyst. The photocatalysts containing Pt nanoparticles have been synthesized by the photodepositionmethod. The physico-chemical properties of as-prepared photocatalyst were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Adsorption experiments have shown the following order for DCF adsorption: C-TiO2 > P90 > P25, which corresponds nicely with the BET surface area of the catalysts. Pseudo first order rate constants for pure titania photocatalysts were as follows: C-TiO2 > P90 > P25. After immobilization of Pt, rate constants showed an optimum at 1.5 wt.%.

AB In this study, we investigated the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals, clofibric acid and diclofenac, using UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 reactions. The degradation of diclofenac during UV photolysis reaction was faster than that of clofibric acid. Diclofenac was mainly removed by photolysis reaction; clofibric acid was more sensitive to OH radical. More effective removals of clofibric acid and diclofenac were observed when H2O2 was added in the UV photolysis reaction. The competition kinetics showed that the second-order rate constant between the OH radical and the pharmaceuticals was 5.57 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for clofibric acid and 2.45 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for diclofenac, respectively. The major reaction intermediates during the UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 reactions of clofibric acid were 4-chlorophenol and hydroquinone, and these intermediates were degraded as phenol with further reaction.

AB A structural similarity tool was developed and aimed to search for environmentally persistent drugs. The basis for the tool was a selection of so-called anchor molecules and a multidimensional chemical map of drugs. The map was constructed using principal component analysis covering 899 drugs described by 67 diverse calculated chemical descriptors. The anchor molecules (diclofenac, trimethoprim, and carbamazepine) were selected to represent drugs of known environmental concern. In addition 12 chemicals listed by the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants were used representing typical environmental pollutants. Chemical similarity was quantified by measuring relative Euclidean distances in the five-dimensional chemical map, and more than 100 nearest neighbors (kNNs) were found within a relative distance of less than 10% from each drug anchor. The developed chemical similarity approach not only identified persistent or semipersistent drugs but also a large number of potentially persistent drugs lacking environmental fate data.

AB Environmental fates and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment have been the focus of recent research in environmental ecotoxicology. Worldwide studies of common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals have reported detectable levels in the aquatic environment, but there are few studies examining impacts on marine habitats. These drugs can affect the functions of various vertebrates and invertebrates. The stability of two pharmaceuticals, cyclizine (CYC) and prochlorperazine (PCZ), in seawater was examined under light and dark conditions, as well as the toxicity of these compounds to larvae of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, which is a cosmopolitan marine organism found in most of the world's oceans. CYC was very stable under all the tested conditions. On the other hand, PCZ degraded in light but not in the dark, and was more stable in seawater than fresh water. For the barnacle larvae, the LC50 of prochlorperazine was 0.93 mu ml and the LC50 for CYC was approximately 0.04 mu g/ml.

AB Large parts of the central highlands of Mexico are heavily eroded and the success of a planned reforestation program will greatly improve when the organic matter and nutrient content of the soil increases prior to the planting of the trees. This study investigated how the application of biosolids from a pharmaceutical company producing cephalosporines or third generation antibiotics could be used as a soil amendment and affect dynamics of C, P and N in soil. A sandy clay loam soil was sampled, amended with 24 g of dry biosolids kg(-1) dry soil or approximately 32 x 10 3 kg ha(-1) for the 0-10 cm layer, and incubated aerobically while production of carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics of ammonium (NH4+),nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) extractable phosphorus (PO43-), and microbial biomass carbon (C) were monitored. Results showed that the biosolid with pH 12, organic C content 162 g kg(-1), total N 21 g kg(-1), was of excellent quality considering its heavy metal content (USEPA) and a class "B" (USEPA) biosolid considering the amount of pathogens. No cephalosporines could be detected in the biosolid. Addition of biosolid to soil increased production Of CO2 1.4 times and added > 60 mg NH4+ kg(-1). The application of biosolids did not significantly increase the concentration of NO2- which remained < 2 mg N kg(-1) soil, but the concentration of NO3- did increase with 175 mg N kg(-1) soil. The microbial biomass C did not change when sewage biosolids was added and concentrations of extractable PO43- only increased temporarily. Washing the biosolids reduced concentrations of NH4+ and NO3-, but also reduced pathogens and concentrations of chloride (Cl-), which might pose a treat to humans and the environment, respectively. Although the biosolid added valuable nutrients to the soil and did not inhibit C and N mineralization, further investigation into possible long-term environmental effects on soil processes and plant growth is necessary before this biosolid can be used in the field.

AB Through a less-investigated in-situ hot-pressing synthesis method, the phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40 (denoted as PW12) was rapidly incorporated into a metal-organic framework MFM-300(In) in a short time, affording novel PW12@MFM-300(In) composites. This solvent-free preparation process is not only environment-friendly but also energy/time-saving. The inclusion of PW12 in MFM-300(In) was demonstrated by different physical and chemical characterizations. It was interesting to fmd that PW12@MFM-300(In) as new heterocatalysts display synergistic activity for the visible-light-driven catalytic degradation of pharmaceutically active compound sulfamethazine (SMT). 4-PW12@MFM-300(Ln) with excellent robustness possesses the high removal efficiency of about 98% toward SMT within 2 h at room temperature, and can also be recycled multiple times for this catalytic process.

AB Production and human consumption of pharmaceuticals result in contamination of surface waters worldwide. Little is known about the long-term (i.e., over decades) fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems. Here, we show that the most prescribed anxiolytic in Sweden (oxazepam) persists in its therapeutic form for several decades after being deposited in a large freshwater lake. By comparing sediment cores collected in 1995 and 2013, we demonstrate that oxazepam inputs from the early 1970s remained in the sediments until sampling in 2013, despite in situ degradation processes and sediment diagenesis. In laboratory and pond experiments, we further reveal that therapeutic forms of oxazepam can persist over several months in cold (5 degrees C) lake water free from UV light. We conclude that oxazepam can persist in lakes over a time scale much longer than previously realized and that levels can build up in lakes due to both a legacy of past inputs and a growing urban population.

AB The photodegradation of cloramphenicol (CAP) in ultrapure water (UW), untreated surface water (USW), and treated effluent from sewage treatment plant (TESTP) in laboratory scale and pilot scale, was evaluated using solar and artificial radiation. The results show, in all cases, that the CAP degradation occurs according to pseudo-first order kinetics, with the apparent degradation rate constants (k(app)) following the order UW = USW > TESTP. The k(app) and half-life were strongly influenced by the radiation source. Mono-and di-hydroxyl transformation products were identified in UW after 40 min of solar irradiation, while the acute toxicity to Artemia salina increased from 35% to 100%, respectively after 180 and 1440 min of artificial and solar irradiation (94 and 132 kJ L-1), when 99.2 and 97.7% of CAP degradation occurred. The transformation products did not present antimicrobial activity.

AB Mass flows of 13 pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) found in drinking water were studied in the water cycle of Stockholm. Data were collected by analyzing samples of surface water, raw water and drinking water as well as influents, effluents and sludges from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in Stockholm area. A mass balance was performed, based on sold amounts of pharmaceuticals and the measured concentrations in water and sludge. The selected APIs were all present in WWTP effluents and the removal rates for many of them were poor. Mass balance calculations showed that the three studied WWTPs in Stockholm release considerable amounts of the selected APIs into the Baltic Sea while the portions ending up in WWTP sludge were significantly lower. The levels of APIs found in drinking water are low at present, but may increase in the future unless the releases from WWTPs in the catchment of Lake Malaren are mitigated.

AB In recent years growing attention has been paid toward the discharge, presence and potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Using different existing analytical methods several studies have already identified a variety of drugs in waste-, surface- and drinking water. The monitoring of surface waters for drugs is of great importance because drugs are designed to be biological very active substances. A capillary LC/ES-MS-MS method has been developed that enables the sensitive and specific detection of diazepam in water samples up to 0.1 ng/ml (LOD). It requires neither multiple extraction steps, nor the use of large volumes of organic solvent. Applying this assay we have detected diazepam in 'in/effluent samples' collected in Belgium and demonstrated the applicability for water analysis without off-line pre-concentration of the analyte.

AB The possibility of applying main AOP techniques, namely ozonation, H2O2/UV photolysis and TiO2 photocatalysis to provide a significant reduction of toxicity of pharmaceutical mixtures has been evaluated. For the preparation of the mixture six pharmaceuticals were chosen among those found at highest concentrations in Sewage Treatment Plant effluents, namely carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin and propranolol.
   The blue-green alga Synechocaccus leopoliensis and the rotifer Brachyonus calyciflorus were utilised to assess the toxicity of the mixtures after AOP treatments. All the toxicity tests were performed using chronic standardized bioassays. The best results were obtained with ozonation. With this type of treatment a complete removal of mixture toxicity on S. leopolensis was obtained even after the shortest time of application (1 min). The ozonation treatment leads also to removal of all the pharmaceutical mixture toxicity on B. calyciflorus, by applying the oxidizing agent for at least for 2 minutes.

AB Concerns are being expressed recently over possible environmental effects of human pharmaceuticals. Although the likelihood of acute toxicity is low, the continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment means that sublethal effects on non-target organisms need to be seriously considered. One-year-old Atlantic salmon parr were exposed to 7.85 +/- 0.13 mu g L-1 of the antidepressant drug Carbamazepine (CBZ) for five days to investigate changes of mRNA expression in the brain by means of a custom 17k Atlantic salmon cDNA microarray. The selected concentration is similar to upper levels that can be found in hospital and sewage treatment plant effluents. After treatment, 373 features were differently expressed with 26 showing up- or down-regulation of >= 2-fold (p <= 0.05). Among the mRNAs showing the highest change were the pituitary hormones encoding features somatolactin, prolactin and somatotropin, or growth hormone. Functional enrichment and network analyses of up- and down-regulated genes showed that CBZ induced a highly different gene expression profile in comparison to untreated organisms. CBZ induced expression of essential genes of the focal adhesion and extracellular matrix - receptor interaction pathways most likely through integrin alpha-6 (itga6) activation. Negative regulation of apoptotic process, extracellular matrix organization and heme biosynthesis were the most enriched biological process related GO-terms, with the simultaneous enrichment of collagen and extracellular region related cellular component GO-terms, and extracellular matrix structural constituent, hormone activity and chromatin binding molecular function related GO-terms. These results show that relatively low doses of CBZ may affect brain physiology in exposed salmon parr, targeting similar processes as in human, indicating a high degree of conservation of targets of CBZ action. However, and since the mRNAs showing most changes in expression are critical for adaptation to different stressors and life history transitions in Atlantic salmon, more research should be undertaken to assess CBZ effects to avoid impairment of normal development and maintenance of natural populations.

AB The ability of a soil to sustain infiltration rates and to attenuate pollutants is critical for the design and operation of Managed Aquifer Recharge/Soil Aquifer Treatment and phyto-treatment schemes, also referred to as Blue Infrastructures. We investigated the buffering capacity of a sediment sample and a peat soil sample for nutrients and selected pharmaceutical compounds and its evolution under continuous infiltration of secondary treated wastewater (TWW) in column experiments. Samples were obtained from two blue infrastructures, the Sant'Alessio Induced River Bank Filtration plant and the San Niccol large-scale phyto-treatment plant in Italy, and were mainly different in their organic carbon contents (0.9 and 48%, respectively). In the column experiments, a constant infiltration rate of about 0.5L/d was maintained for 6months. After 4months of operation, diclofenac and carbamazepine were spiked into the TWW to evaluate their fate. Water quality was monitored by periodic water sampling from the column inflow, at sampling ports along the column length, and at the outflow. Hydraulic conductivity (K) was also monitored. The hydraulic conductivity of the Sant'Alessio sediment decreased by a factor of 10 during the first 10days of infiltration and then stabilized, while for the San Niccol K (initially lower) remained constant for 50days until it decreased following a change of the redox condition in the column. The different redox conditions, due to the two different soils tested, influenced also the concentration and mobility of PO43-, Fe, Mn, and NPOC, and the speciation of the redox sensitive elements (nitrogen and sulfur). NOPC and phosphate were enriched during the filtration through San Niccol peat soil (from 2 to 4 times, respectively), while they were buffered by the Sant'Alessio sediment (from 0.2 to 0.4 times, respectively). Diclofenac removal (69% and below 20% for San Niccol and Sant'Alessio, respectively) was related to sorption and degradation processes and it was lower than the removal of carbamazepine in both soils (76 and 35%). The buffer capacity differences between the two soils were higher for diclofenac (62%) than carbamazepine (35%). Nevertheless, since no apparent degradation of carbamazepine was detected in both soils, its persistence in the soil may have a larger impact in case of desorption, posing contamination risk to groundwater. The results highlight the importance of the soils or sediments to be used as medium in such nature-based solutions for their operations. They also offer an approach to, e.g., tailor man-made soil layers in infiltration basins. We strongly suggest that soil characteristics and test duration are carefully considered in designing these infrastructures, when nature-based processes are the choice for dealing with reuse of treated wastewater management issues.

AB Before analysis with GC-MS, deconjugation of estrogen conjugates with acid-catalyzed solvolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis is regarded as the indispensable procedure. However, in our study we found in the first time that estrogen sulfates (Estrone-3-sulfate, E1-3S; Estradiol-3-sulfate, E2-3S; Estriol-3-sulfate, E3-3S) could be directly analyzed with GC-MS, and the deconjugation procedure can be omitted. In the procedure, estrogen sulfates could be directly derivatized to their corresponding free estrogen derivatives, in which mixture solution of N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) plus 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was used as the derivatization reagent, and the derivatization conditions were determined at 80A degrees C for 90 min. Possible mechanism of the direct derivatization of estrogen sulfates by BSTFA plus 1% TMCS was suggested. This finding indicated a latent favorable analytical method of estrogen sulfates for environmental samples.

AB The kinetics of oxidation and disinfection processes during ozonation in a full-scale reactor treating secondary wastewater effluent were investigated for seven ozone doses ranging from 0.21 to 1.24 g O-3 g(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOG). Substances reacting fast with ozone, such as diclofenac or carbamazepine (k(P,O3) > 10(4) M-1 s(-1)), were eliminated within the gas bubble column, except for the lowest ozone dose of 0.21 g O-3 g(-1) DOG. For this low dose, this could be attributed to short-circuiting within the reactor. Substances with lower ozone reactivity (k(p,O3) < 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) were only fully eliminated for higher ozone doses.
   The predictions of micropollutant oxidation based on coupling reactor hydraulics with ozone chemistry and reaction kinetics were up to a factor of 2.5 higher than full-scale measurements. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the observed differences were higher than model uncertainties. The overestimation of micropollutant oxidation was attributed to a protection of micropollutants from ozone attack by the interaction with aquatic colloids. Laboratory-scale batch experiments using wastewater from the same full-scale treatment plant could predict the oxidation of slowly-reacting micropollutants on the full-scale level within a factor of 1.5. The Rct value, the experimentally determined ratio of the concentrations of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, was identified as a major contribution to this difference.
   An increase in the formation of bromate, a potential human carcinogen, was observed with increasing ozone doses. The final concentration for the highest ozone dose of 1.24 g O-3 g(-1) DOG was 7.5 mu g L-1, which is below the drinking water standard of 10 mu g L-1. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation of up to 15 ng L-1 was observed in the first compartment of the reactor, followed by a slight elimination during sand filtration. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) increased up to 740 mu g AOC L-1, with no clear trend when correlated to the ozone dose, and decreased by up to 50% during post-sand filtration. The disinfection capacity of the ozone reactor was assessed to be 1-4.5 log units in terms of total cell counts (TCC) and 0.5 to 2.5 log units for Escherichia coli (E. coli). Regrowth of up to 2.5 log units during sand filtration was observed for TCC while no regrowth occurred for E. coli. E. coli inactivation could not be accurately predicted by the model approach, most likely due to shielding of E. coli by flocs. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land application of municipal biosolids can be a source of environmental contamination by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). This study examined PPCP concentrations/temporally discrete mass loads in agricultural tile drainage systems where two applications of biosolids had previously taken place. The field plots received liquid municipal biosolids (LMB) in the fall of 2005 at an application rate of similar to 93,500 L ha(-1), and a second land application was conducted using dewatered municipal biosolids (DMB) applied at a rate of similar to 8 Mt dw ha(-1) in the summer of 2006. The DMB land application treatments consisted of direct injection (DI) of the DMB beneath the soil surface at a nominal depth of similar to 0.11 m, and surface spreading (SS) plus subsequent tillage incorporation of DMB in the topsoil (similar to 0.10 m depth). The PPCPs examined included eight pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, naproxen, carbamazepine, atenolol, sulfamethoxazole), the nicotine metabolite cotinine, and two antibacterial personal care products triclosan and triclocarban. Residues of naproxen, cotinine, atenolol and triclosan originating from the fall 2005 LMB application were detected in tile water nearly nine months after application (triclocarban was not measured in 2005). There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in PPCP mass loads among the two DMB land application treatments (i.e., SS vs. DI): although, average PPCP mass loads late in the study season(> 100 days after application) were consistently higher for the DI treatment relative to the SS treatment. While the concentration of triclosan (similar to 14,000 ng g(-1) dw) in DMB was about twice that of triclocarban (similar to 8000 ng g(-1) dw), the average tile water concentrations for triclosan were much higher (43 +/- 5 ng L-1) than they were for triclocarban (0.73 +/- 0.14 ng L-1). Triclosan concentrations (maximum observed in 2006 similar to 235 ng L-1) in tile water resulting from land applications may warrant attention from a toxicological perspective.

AB Human pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are routinely found in biosolids from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Once land applied, the PPCPs in biosolids are potentially available for plant uptake and bioaccumulation. This study used a greenhouse model to investigate uptake of PPCPs commonly detected in biosolids by the agricultural plant Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris). Two series of greenhouse experiments were conducted as part of this project. In the first set of experiments, four pharmaceuticals were added to an organic matter-rich soil in environmentally relevant concentrations based on typical biosolids application rates, resulting in final soil concentrations of 2.6 ng g(-1) carbamazepine, 3.1 ng g(-1) sulfamethoxazole, 5.4 ng g(-1) salbutamol, and 0.5 ng g(-1) trimethoprim. In the second set of experiments, the cabbage was grown in soil amended with an agronomic rate of biosolids from a local WWTP. The ambient concentration of PPCPs in the biosolids resulted in final soil concentrations of 93.1 ng g(-1) carbamazepine, 67.4 ng g(-1) sulfamethoxazole, 30.3 ng g(-1) salbutamol, 433.7 ng g(-1) triclosan, and 24.7 ng g(-1) trimethoprim. After growing to maturity, the aerials of the plants were separated from roots and the two tissue types were analyzed separately. All four human pharmaceuticals were detected in both tissues in the cabbage grown in the soil fortified with the four pharmaceuticals with median concentrations of 255.4 ng g(-1) aerials and 272.9 ng g(-1) roots carbamazepine; 222.8 ng g(-1) aerials and 260.3 ng g(-1) roots sulfamethoxazole; 108.3 ng g(-1) aerials and 140.6 ng g(-1) roots salbutamol; and 20.6 ng g(-1) aerials and 53.7 ng g(-1) roots trimethoprim. Although all study compounds were present in the biosolids-amended planting soil, only carbamazepine (317.6 ng g(-1) aerials and 416.2 ng g(-1) roots), salbutamol (21.2 ng g(-1) aerials and 187.6 ng g(-1) roots), and triclosan (22.9 ng g(-1) aerials and 1220.1 ng g(-1) roots) were detected in the aerials of the cabbage. In addition to the study compounds detected in the aerials, sulfamethoxazole was detected in the roots of one of the plants in the biosolid-amended soil. In comparison to many previous studies that have utilized PPCP concentration that exceed environmentally relevant concentrations, plants in this study were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the PPCPs, yet resulted in uptake concentrations similar to or greater than those reported in comparable studies. We suggest that rhizosphere conditions, particularly the presence of dissolved organicmatter in the planting matrix, might be one of the critical factors determining mobilization and bioavailability of xenobiotic compounds such as PPCPs.

AB Oxidation of aromatic compounds of phenolic (paracetamol, -oestradiol and salicylic acid) and carboxylic (indomethacin and ibuprofen) structure used in pharmaceutics was studied. Aqueous solutions were treated with pulsed corona discharge (PCD) as a means for advanced oxidation. Pulse repetition frequency, delivered energy dose and oxidation media were the main parameters studied for their influence on the process energy efficiency. The PCD treatment appeared to be effective in oxidation of the target compounds: complete degradation of pollutant together with partial mineralization was achieved at moderate energy consumption; oxidation proceeds faster in alkaline media. Low-molecular carboxylic acids were identified as ultimate oxidation by-products formed in the reaction.

AB Reactions of nitrofuran antibiotics (nitrofurazone (NFZ) and frazolidone (FZD)) with hypochlorite in aqueous Solution were investigated under the conditions that Simulate wastewater disinfection. The chlorination by products were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. At the levels of 5 mu M, NFZ reacted rapidly with free chlorine in neutral pH (7.0), while the FZD-hypochlorite reaction was reasonably slow under the same pH. Nevertheless, the strong mutagenic parents disappeared completely after the hypochlorite reactions, and the chlorination by products were observed to exert a weak mutagenic effect oil Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 Without S9-mix. The extent of the reactions depended oil the chlorine dose, solution PH and Compound Structures.

AB Wastewaters from pharmaceutical manufacturers of cytostatic drugs are, in principle, polluted with them. These compounds can result, under certain circumstances, in toxic and even carcinogenic products. The problem of removing such compounds from water has not yet been completely solved.
   This work comprises the ozone inactivation of 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, azathioprine and methotrexate, four nitrogen bases with cytostatic properties, dissolved in water. Results show that these compounds can be inactivated by ozonation. The composition of the reaction mixture was followed by HPLC and at the end of the reaction the Ames test performed showed that the reaction products were nonmutagenic.

AB Background, aim, and scope The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry and as a matter of public concern. Existing data tend to focus on the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous phase, with limited studies on their concentrations in particulate phase such as sediments. Furthermore, current water quality monitoring does not differentiate between soluble and colloidal phases in water samples, hindering our understanding of the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the concentrations and phase association (soluble, colloidal, suspended particulate matter or SPM) of selected pharmaceuticals (propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac, and meclofenamic acid) in river water, effluents from sewage treatment works (STW), and groundwater in the UK.
   Materials and methods The occurrence and phase association of selected pharmaceuticals propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac, and meclofenamic acid in contrasting aquatic environments (river, sewage effluent, and groundwater) were studied. Colloids were isolated by cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFUF). Water samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE), while SPM was extracted by microwave. All sample extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring.
   Results and discussion Five compounds propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, indomethacine, and diclofenac were detected in all samples, with carbamazepine showing the highest concentrations in all phases. The highest concentrations of these compounds were detected in STW effluents, confirming STW as a key source of these compounds in the aquatic environments. The calculation of partition coefficients of pharmaceuticals between SPM and filtrate (observed partition coefficients, K-p(obs), K-oc(obs)), between SPM and soluble phase (intrinsic partition coefficients, K-p(int), K-oc(int)), and between colloids and soluble phase (K-coc) showed that intrinsic partition coefficients (K-p(int), K-oc(int)) are between 25% and 96%, and between 18% and 82% higher than relevant observed partition coefficients values, and are much less variable. Secondly, K-coc values are 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than K-oc(int) values, indicating that aquatic colloids are substantially more powerful sorbents for accumulating pharmaceuticals than sediments. Furthermore, mass balance calculations of pharmaceutical concentrations demonstrate that between 23% and 70% of propranolol, 17-62% of sulfamethoxazole, 7-58% of carbamazepine, 19-84% of indomethacine, and 9-74% of diclofenac are present in the colloidal phase.
   Conclusions The results provide direct evidence that sorption to colloids provides an important sink for the pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Such strong pharmaceutical/colloid interactions may provide a long-term storage of pharmaceuticals, hence, increasing their persistence while reducing their bioavailability in the environment.
   Recommendations and perspectives Pharmaceutical compounds have been detected not only in the aqueous phase but also in suspended particles; it is important, therefore, to have a holistic approach in future environmental fate investigation of pharmaceuticals. For example, more research is needed to assess the storage and long-term record of pharmaceutical residues in aquatic sediments by which benthic organisms will be most affected. Aquatic colloids have been shown to account for the accumulation of major fractions of total pharmaceutical concentrations in the aquatic environment, demonstrating unequivocally the importance of aquatic colloids as a sink for such residues in the aquatic systems. As aquatic colloids are abundant, ubiquitous, and highly powerful sorbents, they are expected to influence the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of such chemicals by aquatic organisms. It is therefore critical for colloids to be incorporated into water quality models for prediction and risk assessment purposes.

AB The discharge of persistent and mobile organic chemicals (PMOCs) into the aquatic environment is a threat to the quality of our water resources. PMOCs are highly polar (mobile in water) and can pass through wastewater treatment plants, subsurface environments and potentially also drinking water treatment processes. While a few such compounds are known, we infer that their number is actually much larger. This Feature highlights the issue of PMOCs from an environmental perspective and assesses the gaps that appear to exist in terms of analysis, monitoring, water treatment and regulation. On this basis we elaborate strategies on how to narrow these gaps with the intention to better protect our water resources.

AB Since 1970, the detection of pharmaceutical substances, in the various aquatic systems, became a global health problem. In this study, separation by the adsorption process in the presence of activated carbon cocoa shells (ACCS) as adsorbant was applied for the treatment of effluents containing antibiotic drugs (rifampicin). The influence of process variables such as the adsorption time, initial rifampicin concentration, pH, temperature, and ACCS dose on adsorption performance has been investigated. The general order kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm model provided the best fit to the experimental data. The negative enthalpy indicates an exothermic process that occurs via physisorption. From the experimental results, the values of isosteric heat decreased with increasing the surface coverage, indicating the presence of strong interactions.

AB Wastewater, especially anaerobic treatment effluent, contains high ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and inorganic orthophosphate (PO4-P), which necessitate additional treatment to meet stringent discharge regulations. Ion exchange regeneration is a process that can be adopted for not only removing but also recovering nutrients. However, recovering nutrients by ion exchange from nutrient-rich effluents that also contain micropollutants (which typically pass through anaerobic treatment as well) may result in subsequent problems, since micropollutants could end up in ion exchange effluent, regenerant, or recovered fertilizer products. Micropollutant removal by a nonselective adsorbent, such as biosolids-derived biochar, before nutrient recovery processes would mitigate potential risks. The objective of this research was to evaluate the capability of biosolids-derived biochar as a pretreatment step for separating micropollutants from nutrient-rich water before ion exchange for nutrient recovery. In the presence of ammonium and phosphate, both pristine and regenerated biosolids-derived biochar could effectively adsorb triclosan (TCS) and estradiol (E2), and to a lesser extent, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in batch sorption experiments. On the other hand, nutrient ions were not effectively adsorbed by biosolids-derived biochar. A continuous flow-through system consisting of columns in series filled with biochar, LayneRT, and then clinoptilolite was operated to test selective removal of micropollutants and nutrients in a flow-through system. The biochar column achieved more than 80% removal of influent TCS and E2, thereby reducing the chances of micropollutants being adsorbed by ion exchangers. Sulfamethoxazole removal through the biochar column was only 50%, indicating that biosolids-derived biochar would have to be optimized in the future for hydrophilic micropollutant removal. Influent nutrients were not effectively removed by the biochar column, but were captured in their respective selective ion exchanger columns. This research revealed that biosolids-derived biochar could be employed before ion exchange resins for removal of micropollutants from nutrient-rich water.

AB As freshwater is a limited resource in many parts of the world, the use of wastewater for irrigation has become an important alternative. Therefore, many countries facing a water deficit, use partially treated, or even untreated, wastewater. This may increase the input of many contaminants into the environment. In the present study, we investigated the effect of using surfactant rich water in irrigation on the mobility of the most commonly-used veterinary antibiotic, monensin. Nine PVC lysimeters, 1.0 m long x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil to a bulk density of 1.35 Mg m(-3). Cattle manure, containing monensin, was applied at the surface of the lysimeters at the recommended rate of 10 t/ha. Each of three aqueous Brij 35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 g L-1, was applied to the lysimeters in triplicate. Over a 90 day period, soil and leachate samples were collected and analyzed. The results of the laboratory sorption experiment showed that when the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 is present, the sorption coefficient of monensin was reduced significantly from 120.22 mL g(-1) in the aqueous medium to 112.20, 100 and 63.09 mL g(-1) with Brij35 concentrations of 0.25, 2.5 and 5 g L-1, respectively. The lysimeter results indicated a significant downward movement of monensin at depths of 60 cm in the soil profile and leachate in the presence of the surfactant. Thus, the continuous use of poor quality water could influence the transport of monensin in agricultural soils, and consequently, pose a risk for groundwater pollution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigates the fate of trace organic chemicals (TrOCs) in three full-scale reclamation plants using ozonation followed by biological activated carbon (BAG) filtration to treat wastewater treatment plant effluents. Chemical analysis was used to quantify a wide range of TrOCs and combined with bioanalytical tools to assess non-specific toxicity (Microtox assay) and estrogenicity (E-SCREEN assay). Limited dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal (<10%) was observed in the ozonation stages showing that oxidation leads to the formation of transformation products rather than mineralization. The quantified TrOCs were removed to a degree highly dependent on the compounds' structures and the specific ozone dose (mg(O3) mg(DOC)(-1)). Non-specific toxicity was reduced by 31-39%, demonstrating that the mixture of remaining parent compounds and their transformation products as well as newly formed oxidation by-products had an overall lower toxic potential than the mixture of parent compounds. Estrogenicity was reduced by more than 87% indicating that the transformation products of the estrogenic chemicals lost their specific toxicity potential. The subsequent BAG filtration removed between 20 and 50% of the DOG depending on the plant configuration, likely due to biodegradation of organic matter. The filtration was also able to reduce the concentrations of most of the remaining TrOCs by up to 99%, and reduce non-specific toxicity by 33-54%. Overall, the combination of ozonation and BAG filtration can achieve removals of 50% for DOC and more than 90% for a wide range of TrOCs as well as a reduction of 70% of non-specific toxicity and more than 95% of estrogenicity. This process combination is therefore suggested as an effective barrier to reduce the discharge of TrOCs into the environment or their presence in water recycling schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Removal potential of many EDCs by conventional WWTPs is recognized. Nevertheless, in order to reach very low concentrations, further treatment (e.g., chemical oxidation) might be required. In this work, two estrogen-like substances were considered: nonylphenol (NP) (and its parent compounds) and bisphenol A (BPA). The experimental work was conducted at Verona (Northern Italy) WWTP (370,000 p.e.): the effluent was submitted to ozonation in a pilot scale plant. Beside chemical and microbiological analyses, estrogenic activity measurements were also carried out by means of breast cancer MCF-7 cells transfected with the luminescence luciferase gene. Economic feasibility of tertiary ozonation is finally discussed.

AB Research on employing advanced oxidation processes (A0P5) for pharmaceuticals removal is gaining interests. However, detrimental effects of background water constituents in complex water matrices are limiting their implementation. In this study, we report red light induced methylene blue photosensitization (MB/Red-light) as a promising alternative for pharmaceuticals removal from wastewater, because of its potential to overcome detrimental effects of background water constituents as experienced in other AOP technologies. In this study, the efficacy of MB/Red-light on degradation of four pharmaceutical compounds, i.e. diclofenac (DFN), metoprolol (MTP), propranolol (PRP) and sulfamethoxazole (SFZ), was investigated. The MB/Red-light photosensitization enabled degradation of three model compounds, i.e. DFN, PRP and SFZ. Degradation rates followed the order of DFN > PRP > SFZ. Singlet oxygen was found to be crucial in pharmaceuticals degradation, and another additional mechanism, i.e. a direct reaction with triplet MB,. also contributed to DFN degradation. The presence of two DFN degradation mechanisms were confirmed by UV-vis light absorbance spectra measurement as well as the identification of degradation products by LC-MS/MS. Effects of three common back ground water constituents were examined to assess the applicability of MB/red-light system in complex water matrices, which suggests that the MB/red-light system has great potential to be used in real wastewater. Higher pH was found to impose positive impact on the efficacy of the proposed system. Last but not least, red light LED is an optimum light source for the proposed MB/Red-light system, because the light emission spectrum of the LED used in this study fits well with the light absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer-methylene blue.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in aquatic environment worldwide and suspected for potential ecological consequences. However, occurrences, sources and potential risks of pharmaceutical residues have rarely been investigated in Bangkok, Thailand, one of most densely populated cities in the world. We collected water samples from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), six canals, and in mainstream Chao Phraya River of Bangkok, in three sampling events representing different seasonal flow conditions, i.e., June and September 2011 and January 2012. Fourteen major pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, roxithromycin, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim were analyzed. Levels of pharmaceutical residues in WWTP influents on average were the highest for acetylsalicylic acid (4700 ng L-1), followed by caffeine (2250 ng L-1) and ibuprofen (702 ng L-1). In effluents, the concentration of caffeine was the highest (307 ng L-1), followed by acetylsalicylic acid (261 ng L-1) and mefenamic acid (251 ng L-1). In surface water, acetylsalicylic acid showed the highest levels (on average 1360 ng L-1 in canals and 313 ng L-1 in the river). Removal efficiencies of WWTPs for roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine were determined negligible. For several compounds, the concentrations in ambient water were higher than those detected in the effluents, implying contribution of the WWTPs to be negligible. Hazard quotients estimated for acetylsalicylic acid, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac and mefenamic acid in most of the canals and that of ciprofloxacin in the river, were greater than or close to 1, suggesting potential ecological risks. Ecological implications of the pharmaceutical residues in Bangkok waterway warrant further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) is a biological wastewater treatment process used for stabilisation of domestic, animal, food and pharmaceutical sludges, and wastewater. It produces a high-quality effluent due to thermophilic processing conditions, however the stabilised sludge has poor settling characteristics, a high water content, low compaction capacity and is difficult to dewater by mechanical processes alone. These factors impact transport and disposal of processed ATAD sludge. We have carried out a detailed morphological characterisation of ATAD sludge at all stages of the ATAD process in an attempt to determine key characteristics of the sludge that might be responsible for its poor dewatering and settleability. A number of microscopic techniques including electron, optical, wide field and laser scanning confocal microscopy were applied to fresh, fixed or embedded sludge taken at various stages during a full scale ATAD process treating domestic sludge. The spatial distributions of structural sludge matrix components were determined and suggested a highly dynamic sludge morphology during the overall process. Large amounts of fibres were observed in the feed sludge, whereas thermophilic sludge liquor with low settleability was shown to have a lower protein to polysaccharide ratio (1:0.9) compared to the easily settled fraction where ratio values were in the range of (1:1.14-1:1.7) with a prevalence of protein constituents. ATAD sludge was also shown to contain colloids, slime, cellulose micro-particles and multiple hydrophobic droplets in the bulk liquor, factors that may markedly impact on sludge dewaterability characteristics. Laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated a superior ability to identify composition and spatial localisation of structural constituents in such a dispersed, high water content sludge.

AB Background In order to protect aquatic environments and to reduce the presence of micropollutants in the global water cycle, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) often implement an additional treatment step. One of the most effective measures is the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) as an adsorbent for micropollutants. This method provides sufficient elimination rates for several micropollutants and has been successfully employed in many WWTPs. Despite this success, there might be a drawback as the retention of the PAC in the WWTP can be challenging and losses of micropollutant-loaded PAC into the aquatic environment may occur. Upon emission, micropollutant-loaded PAC is expected to settle to the benthic zone of receiving waters, where sediment-dwelling organisms may ingest these particles. Therefore, the present study investigated possible adverse effects of micropollutant-loaded PAC from a WWTP as compared to unloaded (native) and diclofenac-loaded PAC on the sediment-dwelling annelid Lumbriculus variegatus. Results Native PAC induced the strongest effects on growth (measured as biomass) and reproduction of the annelids. The corresponding medium effective concentrations (EC50) were 1.7 g/kg and 1.8 g/kg, respectively. Diclofenac-loaded PAC showed lower effects with an EC50 of 2.5 g/kg for growth and EC50 of 3.0 g/kg for reproduction. Although tested at the same concentrations, the micropollutant-loaded PAC from the WWTP did not lead to obvious negative effects on the endpoints investigated for L.variegatus and only a slight trend of a reduced growth was detected. Conclusion We did not detect harmful effects on L. variegatus caused by the presence of MP-loaded PAC from a WWTP which gives an auspicious perspective for PAC as an advanced treatment option.

AB Estrogenically active compounds (EACs) in surface waters can disrupt the endocrine system of biota, raising concern for aquatic species. Concentrations of EACs are generally higher in effluent-dominated aquatic systems, such as California's Santa Ana River (SAR). Addressing estrogenicity of effluent-dominated waters is increasingly important due to both increasing urbanization and climate change. To this end, water samples were collected from multiple sites downstream of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and intermittent points along the SAR during 2018-2019 and cell-based bioassays were used to determine estrogen receptor activity. During baseflow conditions, the highest estradiol equivalencies (EEQs) from all SAR water between summer (August and September) and fall (November) sampling events in 2018 were fromYorba Linda (EEQ= 1.36 +/- 0.38 ng/L) and Prado (1.14 +/- 0.13 ng/L), respectively. Water extracts in January 2019 following a major rainfall generally had higher EEQs with the highest EEQ of 10.0 +/- 0.69 ng/L observed at Yorba Linda. During low flow conditions in November 2018, male Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish were exposed to SAR water to compare to cell bioassay responses and targeted analytical chemistry for 5 steroidal estrogens. Chemical-based EEQ correlations with in vitro EEQs were statistically significant. However, vitellogenin (vtg) mRNA expression in the livers of medaka exposed to SAR water was not significantly different compared to controls. These results indicate that seasonal variation and surface water runoff events influence estrogenic activity in the SAR and may induce estrogenic effects to native fish populations in wastewater-dominated streams in general.

AB Treated wastewater (TWW) is increasingly used for agricultural irrigation, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Carbamazepine is among the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in TWW. Moreover, its uptake and accumulation have been demonstrated in crops irrigated with TWW. A previous controlled trial found that urine concentrations of carbamazepine were higher in healthy volunteers consuming TWW-irrigated produce as compared to freshwater-irrigated produce. The aim of the current study was to assess whether carbamazepine is quantifiable in urine of Israelis consuming their usual diets and whether concentrations vary according to age, personal characteristics and diet. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 245 volunteers, including a reference group of omnivorous healthy adults aged 18-66; pregnant women; children aged 3-6 years; adults aged > 75 years; and vegetarians/vegans. Participants provided spot urine samples and reported 24-hour and "usual" dietary consumption. Urinary carbamazepine levels were compared according to group, personal characteristics, health behaviors, and reported diet. Carbamazepine was detectable (>= 1.66 ng/L) in urine of 84%, 76%, 75.5%, 66%, and 19.6% of the reference group, vegetarians, older adults, pregnant women, and children, respectively. Quantifiable concentrations (>= 5.0 ng/L) of carbamazepine were found in 58%, 46%, 36.7%, 14%, and 0% of these groups, respectively (p = 0.001 for comparison of proportions across groups). In adults, higher carbamazepine concentrations were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with self-defined vegetarianism, usual consumption of dairy products and at least five vegetables/day, and no meat or fish consumption in the past 24 hours. This study demonstrates that people living in a water-scarce region with widespread TWW irrigation, are unknowingly exposed to carbamazepine. Individuals adhering to recommended guidelines for daily fresh produce consumption may be at higher risk of exposure to TWW-derived contaminants of emerging concern.

AB In this study, silica@chitosan-glutaraldehyde (Si@Cs-G) was synthesized as a novel adsorbent for extraction of Penicillin G (PG) from the synthetic and real samples followed by HPLC determination. The synthesized adsorbents were characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The factors influencing the extraction efficiency including pH, sorbent dose, extraction time, extraction solvent type and its volume were investigated and optimized.
   Under the optimal conditions (sorbent dosage: 25 mg, desorption solvent (acetonitrile) with volume of 0.75 mL; pH: 6 and extraction time: 50 min), the Si@Cs-G demonstrated high efficiency and linearity (R-2 > 0.999) with the concentration of penicillin G ranging from 1 to 300 mu g L-1. Extraction recovery in synthetic samples was 98.977%, with LOD = 0.493 mu g L-1, LOQ = 1.63 8 mu g L-1 and RSD < 1.953%. The method was successfully applied for determination of PG in real water samples (tap, river, lake and well water) and wastewater samples (SH and SHB hospital effluent). The obtained relative recoveries were in the range of 91.31%-123.27% with RSD less than 6.34% for all the real samples. The dominant mechanism in the PG adsorption process was involved in the pi-pi interaction, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interaction. (c) 2020 The Authors.

   Abstract In this study, we present an innovative new bio-treatment approach for 17 alpha-ethynyestradiol (EE2). Our solution for EE2 decontamination was accomplished by using the SBP (Small Bioreactor Platform) macro-encapsulation method for the encapsulation of two bacterial cultures, Rhodococcus zopfii (R. zopfii ) and Pseudomonas putida F1 (P. putida). Our results show that the encapsulated R. zopffi presented better biodegradation capabilities than P. putida F1. After 24 h of incubation on minimal medium supplemented with EE2 as a sole carbon source, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was 73.8% and 86.5% in the presence of encapsulated P. putida and R. zopfii, respectively. In the presence of additional carbon sources, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was 75% and 56.1% by R. zopfii and P. putida, respectively, indicating that the presence of other viable carbon sources might slightly reduce the EE2 biodegradation efficiency. Nevertheless, in domestic secondary effluents, EE2 biodegradation efficacy was similar to the minimal medium, indicating good adaptation of the encapsulated cultures to sanitary effluents and lack of a significant effect of the presence of other viable carbon sources on the EE2 biodegradation by the two encapsulated cultures. Our findings demonstrate that SBP-encapsulated R. zopfii and P. putida might present a practical treatment for steroidal hormones removal in wastewater treatment processes.

AB In this study, a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 80 days to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing m-cresol (MC) and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA). The aim of the study is to investigate the performance and methane fermentation characteristics of AnMBR at different hydraulic retention time (HRT) (48, 36, 24, 18 and 12 h). The average total removal efficiencies of MC and IPA were 95%, 96% during the 80 days, which demonstrated that the AnMBR system performed well in the MC and IPA removal. The major volatile fatty acid (VFA) was found to be acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, besides, the VFA accumulated apparently when HRT decreased to 12 h. The decrease of HRT led to an increase of relative abundance of methanosarcina from 13 to 33% and a decrease in biogas yield from 0.19 to 0.05 L/gCOD(removal). The biogas production was found to increase dramatically at HRT of 36 h. The trend of methane content kept stable at this stage with the average value of 78.5% which higher than other HRTs. The investigation of methanogen community showed that methanosarcinaceae was always dominant acetoclastic methanogens and methanomicrobiales was the dominant hydrogen utilizers throughout the operational period. When the HRT dropped to 12 h, the growth of the methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales was observed, the amount of the methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales sharply increased. After the overall research, HRT of 36 h was chosen as the most suitable operating condition due to the comprehensively preferable performance and more economical. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sunlight/H2O2 process has recently been considered as a sustainable alternative option compared to other solar driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in advanced treatment of municipal wastewater (WW) to be reused for crop irrigation. Accordingly, in this study sunlight/ H2O2 was used as disinfection/oxidation treatment for urban WW treatment plant effluent in a compound parabolic collector photoreactor to assess subsequent cross-contamination of lettuce and soil by contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) (determined by QuEChERS extraction and LCQqLIT-MS/MS analysis) and antibiotic resistant (AR) bacteria after irrigation with treated WW. Three CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), flumequine (FLU), and thiabendazole (TBZ) at 100 mu g L-1) and two AR bacterial strains (E. coli and E. faecalis, at 105 CFU mL(-1)) were spiked in real WW. A detection limit (DL) of 2 CFU mL(-1) was reached after 120 min of solar exposure for AR E. coli, while AR E. faecalis was more resistant to the disinfection process (240 min to reach DL). CBZ and TBZ were poorly removed after 90 min (12% and 50%, respectively) compared to FLU (94%). Lettuce was irrigated with treated WW for 5 weeks. CBZ and TBZ were accumulated in soil up to 472 ng g(-1) and 256 ng g(-1) and up-taken by lettuce up to 109 and 18 ng respectively, when 90 min treated WW was used for irrigation; whereas no bacteria contamination was observed when the bacterial density in treated WW was below the DL. A proper treatment time (>90 min) should be guaranteed in order to avoid the transfer of pathogens from disinfected WW to irrigated crops and soil.

AB Low levels of pharmaceuticals are detected in surface, ground, and drinking water worldwide. Usage and incorrect disposal have been considered the major environmental sources of these microcontaminants. Recent publications, however, suggest that wastewater from drug production can potentially be a source of much higher concentrations in certain locations. The present study investigated the environmental fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a major production area for the global bulk drug market. Water samples were taken from a common effluent treatment plant near Hyderabad, India, which receives process water from approximately 90 bulk drug manufacturers. Surface water was analyzed from the recipient stream and from two lakes that are not contaminated by the treatment plant. Water samples were also taken from wells in six nearby villages. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All wells were determined to be contaminated with drugs. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, cetirizine, terbinafine, and citalopram were detected at more than 1 mu g/L in several wells. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (14 mg/L) and cetirizine (2.1 mg/L) were found in the effluent of the treatment plant, together with high concentrations of seven additional pharmaceuticals. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (up to 6.5 mg/L), cetirizine (up to 1.2 mg/L), norfloxacin (up to 0.52 mg/L), and enoxacin (up to 0.16 mg/L) were also detected in the two lakes, which clearly shows that the investigated area has additional environmental sources of insufficiently treated industrial waste. Thus, insufficient wastewater management in one of the world's largest centers for bulk drug production leads to unprecedented drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water. This raises serious concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance, and it creates a major challenge for producers and regulatory agencies to improve the situation.

   control; PPCPs
AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater poses huge environmental threats, even at trace concentrations, and novel approaches are urged due to the inefficiencies of conventional wastewater treatment plants, especially when processing contaminants at high concentrations. Meanwhile, another widespread problem in the aquatic domain is the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) which cause serious damage to the ecosystem, but have rarely been investigated for possible valorization. This study investigated the possibilities, mechanisms, and effects of toxin release of using a harmful cyanobacterial species, Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa), in order to remove the widely used drug, tetracycline, at high concentration. The results were compared with the performance obtained by the use of the hitherto generally-selected chlorophyte alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa) for tetracycline concentrations of 10-100 mg L-1. M. aeruginosa exhibited a much more effective and rapid tetracycline removal (over 98.0% removal in 2 days) than did C. pyrenoidosa (36.7%-93.9% in 2 days). A comprehensive kinetic investigation into probable removal pathways indicated that, theoretically, bio-remediation dominated the process by M. aeruginosa (71.6%), while only accounting for 20.5% by C. pyrenoidosa. Both microalgae promoted the hydrolysis of tetracycline under conditions of increased pH and inhibited abiotic photolytic reactions by the shading effect to the water column, when compared with control experiments. Although identical degradation by-products were identified from treatments by both microalgal species, distinct by-products were also confirmed, unique to each treatment. Moreover, the growth of M. aeruginosa biomass exhibited strong tolerance to tetracycline exposure and released significantly lower levels of microcystin-LR, compared with the control systems. This study supports the possibility of reusing HABs species for the effective remediation of antibiotics at high concentrations. We have further suggested possible mechanisms for remediation and demonstrated control of toxin release. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, long-term performance of a persulfate (PS)-assisted direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process was examined for the treatment of secondary treated effluent spiked with a mixture of micropollutants including three pesticides and nine pharmaceuticals. A stand-alone DCMD (`control') was also operated under identical operating conditions for comparison. Depending on the micropollutant, the stand-alone DCMD achieved 86 to > 99% removal. In comparison, removal by the PS-assisted DCMD was > 99% for all investigated micropollutants. This was attributed to the fact that sulfate radicals (SO4-center dot) formed following the activation of PS at the DCMD operating temperature (i.e., 40 degrees C) achieved micropollutant-specific degradation, which reduced the accumulation of micropollutants in the feed. Chemical structures of the micropollutants governed their degradation by PS. Effective degradation ( > 90%) was achieved for micropollutants that contain strong electron -donating functional groups (EDGs) in their molecules (e.g., amitriptyline and trimethoprim). Micropollutants containing both strong electron-withdrawing functional groups (EWGs) and EDGs in their molecules were moderately degraded (60-80%). In addition to the micropollutants, activated PS significantly degraded total organic carbon (70%) and total nitrogen (40%) from the secondary treated wastewater. This helped to reduce the fouling layer on the membrane-surface in the PS-assisted DCMD system. PS-addition appears to slightly increase the toxicity of wastewater, but with effective retention of PS and degradation products, DCMD permeate (i.e., treated effluent) was not toxic. This is the first study demonstrating the performance of the persulfate oxidation process in a continuous-flow membrane system for micropollutant removal and membrane fouling control.

AB The present study is an overview of the literature on the occurrence and potential risks of pharmaceutical substances in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), natural waters and drinking water treatment plants served by the Great Lakes Basin (Canada and the USA) between the years of 2007-2012. Large number of pharmaceutical substances, including anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, antidepressants, antibiotics, beta blockers, anti-epileptics, anti-hypertensions and stimulants, in high ng/L concentrations, has been reported in the WWTP influents. Most of these compounds have also been detected in the WWTP effluents at comparable concentrations with the exception of caffeine, cotinine and salicylic acid suggesting the inefficiency of conventional treatment processes in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. Decreasing surface water concentrations have been observed with the distance downstream of the discharge point due to the dilution effect. Surface waters located around septic systems and agricultural areas have also been found to be contaminated with pharmaceutical substances. Carbamazepine, caffeine, its metabolite paraxanthine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole have been frequently detected in the surface waters. The number of occurrences of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, sulfamethoxazole and macrolide antibiotics in drinking water sources, at ng/L concentration ranges, has been quite high. Although the detection frequencies in treated drinking waters were relatively low, the concentrations of the above mentioned pharmaceutical substances were at the same range as the source water concentrations. Six of the detected pharmaceutical substances, namely, fluoxetine, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, carbamazepine and esterone exhibit a high environmental risk in Great Lakes WWTP effluents and surface waters, while none of the pharmaceutical substances seem to pose a risk for human health at their highest reported concentrations in the drinking water sources from the Great Lakes.

Organoclays are obtained by the combination of clay minerals and surfactants (quaternary alkyl ammonium salts and others) and are appropriate candidates for the adsorption of organic contaminants such as pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals that are more and more found in the water resource despite wastewater treatments. This review article focuses on novel organoclay preparation methods based on the use of nonconventional nonionic surfactants and the interest and limits of these hybrid materials for the adsorption of organic compounds at both batch equilibrium and dynamical percolation experimental conditions.

AB Ozonation of water effluent polluted with carbamazepine an ubiquitous and refractory pharmaceutical contaminant, has been addressed. This paper aims to optimize the remediation process through novel considerations, such as economical aspects of operational costs. To this end, firstly, we have defined an efficiency variable which included not only global efficacy terms (pollutant removal) but also kinetic aspects, which has to do with the ozonation chemical rate. This target variable was involved in a design of experiments that optimized air flow, ozone concentration, and pollutant initial content. An optimum was obtained at 55 L.h(-1), 0.4 g.m(3), and 18 mg.L-1 respectively.

AB Discharge of pharmaceutical wastewaters can cause substantial environmental impacts. Since the conventional wastewater treatment processes are not efficient for comprehensive separation of pharmaceutical substances, a non-dispersive solvent extraction via a hollow fiber membrane contactor can be a promising alternative. In the present study, a structurally developed poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) hollow fiber membrane was fabricated via a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process to enhance extraction of penicillin-G (Pen-G) from the wastewater. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of the main operating variables in the liquid-liquid membrane contactor process. From FESEM examination, the prepared membrane showed an open structure with large finger-likes, ultra-thin outer skin, and inner skinless layer. The membrane presented a narrow pore size distribution with mean pore size of 0.038 mu m, water contact angle of about 94 degrees, critical water entry pressure of 350 kPa, and overall porosity of about 84 %. Extraction of Pen-G from the aqueous phase by 5 wt% organic solution of Aliquat 336 was performed. The feed concentration of 218 ppm, temperature of 41 degrees C, flowrate of 51 ml/min, and the organic phase flowrate of 144 ml/min were the optimum values predicted by the model. A maximum Pen-G extraction flux of 1.55x10(-3) kg/m(2) s was predicted at the optimum operating conditions. The value of error between the experimental and predicted fluxes was about 3.23% which confirmed accuracy of the model. Due to the developed membrane structure, the prepared PVDF-HFP hollow fiber membrane showed a considerably higher Pen-G extraction flux compared to the PP commercial membranes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigates the influence of fouling and solute-solute interactions on the rejection of four pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) by two commercial nanofiltration (NF) membranes for a water reuse purpose. Membrane bioreactor effluent was filtered and modification of membrane surface was fully characterized (roughness, MWCO, contact angle, zeta potential ... ). It was shown that polysaccharides and humic acid were the major compounds adsorbed on the membrane which causes the flux decline. Flux decline was more severe for NF-90 than NF-270 due to a higher roughness and hydrophobicity and smaller pore size. This fouling layer modified the membrane surface properties like hydrophobicity and charge. PhACs were then filtered in Milli-Q water, using virgin and pre-fouled membranes, or in real effluent, using virgin membranes, so as to identify basic phenomena involved in their retention. It appeared that changes in membrane surface affected transport and retention of salts and PhACs in comparison with unfouled membranes, especially for NF-270. The comparison between filtration of PhACs in Milli-Qwater or real effluent evidenced the effect of solute-solute interactions on retention. For all tested PhACs, rejection by NF-270 was improved when filtering spiked MBR effluent in comparison with spiked Milli-Q. The influence of the matrice was less pronounced for the NF-90. Two counteractive mechanisms appeared to be involved in the rejection of pharmaceuticals by a loose-NF like NF-270: adsorption onto macromolecules in the surrounding matrice resulting in increased rejection and the presence of a fouling layer leading to decrease in rejection. Finally, NF-90 could be a possible alternative to the systematic reverse osmosis scheme and allowed great rejection capacities and cost saving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, concern has grown regarding the presence of triclosan (TCS) in waters because of its potential for causing ecological and human health effects. The authors present a statistical analysis of TCS concentrations reported between 1999 and 2012 in freshwater environments in the United States and provide a comparison with available health-based and aquatic guidance values. Data from 46 peer-reviewed and unpublished investigations from 45 states and 1 US territory were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing the following coded water types: untreated (raw wastewater), effluent (wastewater treatment plant effluent), effluent-impacted environmental, environmental, and finished drinking water (total n=2305). Triclosan was most frequently detected in untreated waters (92% detection frequency; mean +/- standard error, 11270 +/- 2925ng/L; n=237), but concentrations were significantly reduced in effluent waters (83% detection frequency 775 +/- 311ng/L; n=192, =0.05). Triclosan concentration in effluent-impacted environmental waters (62% detection frequency; 130 +/- 17ng/L; n=228) was not significantly reduced from effluent waters but was significantly greater than TCS in environmental waters not classified as effluent impacted (11% detection frequency; 13 +/- 3ng/L; n=1195). In finished drinking water, TCS was largely undetected (1% detection frequency; 4 +/- 2ng/L n=453), suggesting that for the United States, drinking water is not an appreciable source of TCS exposure. In posttreatment waters, average TCS concentrations were below part-per-billion levels. Although no US regulatory standard exists for TCS in aquatic systems, comparison of averages reported in the present study with a predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 500ng/L showed that 5.3% of effluent-impacted environmental waters were above the PNEC for changes in algal biomass, while only 0.25% of environmental waters surpassed this value.

AB As forward osmosis (FO) gains attention as an efficient technology to improve wastewater reclamation processes, it is fundamental to determine the influence of fouling in the rejection of emerging contaminants (micropollutants). This study focuses on the rejection of 13 selected micropollutants, spiked in a secondary wastewater effluent, by a FO membrane, using Red Sea water as draw solution (DS), differentiating the effects on the rejection caused by a clean and fouled membrane. The resulting effluent was then desalinated at low pressure with a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, to produce a high quality permeate and determine the rejection with a coupled forward osmosis - low pressure reverse osmosis (FO-LPRO) system. When considering only FO with a clean membrane, the rejection of the hydrophilic neutral compounds was between 48.6% and 84.7%, for the hydrophobic neutrals the rejection ranged from 40.0% to 87.5%, and for the ionic compounds the rejections were between 92.9% and 96.5%. With a fouled membrane, the rejections were between 44.6% and 95.2%, 48.7%-91.5% and 96.9%-98.6%, respectively. These results suggest that, except for the hydrophilic neutral compounds, the rejection of the micropollutants is increased by the presence of a fouling layer, possibly due to the higher hydrophilicity of the FO fouled membrane compared to the clean one, the increased adsorption capacity of hydrophilic compounds and reduced mass transport capacity, membrane swelling, and the higher negative charge of the membrane surface, related to the foulants composition, mainly NOM acids (carboxylic radicals) and polysaccharides or polysaccharide-like substances. However, when coupled with RO, the rejections in both cases increased above 96%. The coupled FO-LPRO system was an effective double barrier against the selected micropollutants.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfamethoxazole (SMX, used as a model bacteriostatic antibiotic) is persistent to conventional biological treatments of wastewaters. In this work, conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO) was found to be an effective technology for its removal from the effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants. RESULTS: The use of CDEO has been evaluated for the removal of the antibiotic SMX from water and wastewaters. The results show that CDEO can reduce the concentration of this organic pollutant to values below 0.1 mu g dm-3. The variation of the SMX concentration during electrolysis shows a complex shape with a plateau zone that increases in size with the initial concentration of SMX. This complex trend is not observed in the changes of TOC, which seems to indicate that the CDEO of SMX solutions does not lead directly to the generation of carbon dioxide as a final product. A tentative reaction pathway has been proposed based on a thorough analysis of the reaction mixture, in which the main intermediate products were identified. The use of liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) allowed the identification of nine organic intermediates (with Mw 98, 108, 172, 173, 197, 203, 227, 269 and 287) during the electrolysis and the concentration of these compounds depends on the initial SMX concentration and on the current density applied. CONCLUSIONS: CDEO is able to reduce the concentration of the organic pollutant below 0.1 mg dm-3. SMX removal is faster than that of TOC. This fact indicates the formation of reaction intermediates. Analytical techniques show that nine reaction intermediates are generated in the system, and that their concentration depends on the initial SMX concentration and on the current density used.

AB The immobilization of active photo-Fenton heterogeneous catalysts over different materials, mainly polymers, has been studied in the literature to avoid their separation from the reaction solution. However, those materials exhibited a high preparation cost and low stability in the process, being difficult their application in an industrial wastewater treatment plant. In this work, a dip-coating method for the immobilization of goethite film on the wall of a photo-Fenton reactor was studied. The influence of the concentration of the initial goethite suspension as well as the withdrawal speed on the coating process, were evaluated. Both variables have shown to be critical in the homogeneity and the optical properties of the layer and therefore in its activity in the photo-assisted reaction.
   The immobilized photo-Fenton system was tested in the degradation of a mixture of six selected pharmaceutical compounds (nicotine, 4-acetamidoantipyrine, hydrochlorothiazide, ranitidine, diclofenac sodium and sulfamethoxazole) in aqueous solution. The influence of the goethite layer thickness in the photo-activity of the system was established and the results were compared with those obtained using goethite powder in a slurry photo-reactor. One coating cycle, corresponding to 0.05 g/L of catalyst was enough to obtain 100% degradation of the selected pharmaceutical compounds after 6 h of reaction using a low oxidant concentration, except for the nicotine, that seems to be refractory to the tested photo-Fenton system. The use of a commercial goethite as catalyst and the simplicity of the dip-coating procedure make this process an attractive alternative for the design of wastewater treatments based on the heterogeneous photo-Fenton reaction.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been reported as precursors of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and its molecular characteristics are rarely investigated due to its complexity. In this study, changes in the characteristics of DOM were investigated in the lower Phong River in Thailand in dry season and after the first rain in rainy season, using a non-targeted analysis with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The river was rich with CHO features dominated by lignin-like molecules, while lipid-like molecules increase after domestic wastewater discharges. Wastewater discharge released DOM with higher molecular weight (MW) that was less oxygenated (low O/C) and less oxidized (low carbon oxidation state [C-os]). A lake affected by anthropogenic activities contributed more oxidized DOM into the river, while surface runoff carried DOM that is more oxygenated (high O/C), less hydrogenated (low H/C), and more oxidized (high C-os) to the stream. Water treatment further modified DOM to be lower MW. Approximately three hundred Cl-containing features (CHOCI) detected upstream were also found downstream. Disinfection by chlorine (Cl-2) or chlorine dioxide (ClO2) formed both CHO and CHOCl DBPs. Low chlorine dosage applied to upstream and downstream samples resulted in many common unknown DBPs while increasing chlorine dosage resulted in more unique DBPs. At the same dosage, Cl-2 reacted with DOM more than ClO2, including more oxidized molecules that are refractory to ClO2. Both Cl-2 and ClO2 produced chlorinated and non-chlorinated DBPs, and some DBPs were commonly found by both disinfections. Cl-2-produced DBPs were more unsaturated (higher [DBE-O]/C) and oxidized (higher C-os) than ClO2-DBPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Complex chemical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams but relatively little work has been done to characterize them and assess their potential effects in headwater streams. In 2014, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) sampled 54 Piedmont streams over ten weeks and measured 475 unique organic compounds using five analytical methods. Maximum and median exposure conditions were evaluated in relation to watershed characteristics and for potential biological effects using multiple lines of evidence. Results demonstrate that mixed-contaminant exposures are ubiquitous and varied in sampled headwater streams. Approximately 56% (264) of the 475 compounds were detected at least once across all sites. Cumulative maximum concentrations ranged 1,922-162,346 ng L-1 per site. Chemical occurrence significantly correlated to urban land use but was not related to presence/absence of wastewater treatment facility discharges. Designed bioactive chemicals represent about 2/3rd of chemicals detected, notably pharmaceuticals and pesticides, qualitative evidence for possible adverse biological effects. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database chemical-gene associations applied to maximum exposure conditions indicate >12,000 and 2,900 potential gene targets were predicted at least once across all sites for fish and invertebrates, respectively. Analysis of cumulative exposure-activity ratios provided additional evidence that, at a minimum, transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates were common. Finally, cumulative detections and concentrations correlated inversely with invertebrate metrics from in-stream surveys. The results demonstrate widespread instream exposure to extensive contaminant mixtures and compelling multiple lines of evidence for adverse effects on aquatic communities. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmentally friendly gallic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles (GA-MNP) have been synthesized and evaluated as a novel photocatalyst for degradation of meloxicam; a commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The synthesized GA-MNP were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. Results showed the formation of core-shell MNP with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 160.55 +/- 5.02 nm and zeta potential of -42.4 +/- 1.6 mV. A validated RP-HPLC stability-indicating assay was developed for monitoring of meloxicam concentration in the presence of its degradation products and for determination of the kinetics of degradation. Full factorial design (24) was employed in order to investigate the effects of pH, irradiation time, GA-MNP loading and initial meloxicam concentration on the efficiency of the process. The irradiation time was found to be the most significant parameter followed by initial meloxicam concentration and GA-MNP loading, respectively. At the optimized conditions, increasing GA-MNP loading to 5.00 mg mL(-1) demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity when compared to bare MNP and TiO2NP. Meloxicam degradation was found to follow pseudo first order rate kinetics with K-obs and t(0.5) of -0.0029 min(-1) and 239 min, respectively. The protocol was successfully applied for treatment of incurred water samples collected during various cleaning validation cycles. A percentage degradation of 89.10 +/- 0.13% was achieved upon irradiation of samples containing 64.57 +/- 0.09 mu g mL(-1) with UV light (1012 mu W cm(-2), 8 h) in the presence of 5 mg mL(-1) GA-MNP at pH 9.0 +/- 0.05. It could be suggested that treatment of wastewaters collected during the cleaning validation of each pharmaceutical product, before pooling into the general waste pool, should improve the efficiency and economics of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Biosorbents have been recently gaining importance, with an increasing number of publications on their environmental applications, especially for removal of organic pollutants from aqueous media. The aim of this work was to evaluate the sorption capacity of a biosorbent, namely granulated cork, to remove mixtures of ibuprofen (IB), carbamazepine (CB) and clofibric acid (CA) from water and wastewater. High removal efficiencies were attained for IB and CB while a less satisfactory performance was observed for CA. Simultaneous removal of the three compounds mixed in the same aqueous solution showed no significant differences in comparison to the removal of the isolated compounds in separate solutions, which indicates that no competitive sorption effects occurred at the highest concentrations tested. On the other hand, in wastewater medium the mixture of pharmaceuticals underwent a decrease in the sorbed amounts of all the three substances, probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter which increases their solubilities. These compounds were removed in the following order of efficiencies in all the tested conditions: IB > CB > CA. The sorption kinetics were characterised by an initial fast step within the first 6 h, during which most of the removed pharmaceuticals amounts were sorbed. After the first 6 h, CA attained equilibrium concentrations whereas the sorption kinetics for IB and CB were characterised by two pseudo-second order stages, the first one up to 48 h and a slower one beyond 48 h. Shorter equilibration times and larger removed amounts of pharmaceuticals per unit weight of sorbent were observed in this study for granulated cork in comparison with a previously studied clay material (LECA). The results of this study showed the sorptive qualities of granulated cork but are only a first step in the evaluation of this material for use as support matrix in constructed wetlands designed for removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters.

AB Pseudomonas pseudomallei EBN- 10 strain, previously isolated from a local pharmaceutical industry's wastewater, was spontaneously adapted to higher p- nitrophenol ( PNP) levels, which then was subjected to gamma ray- inducedmutagenesis; the efficient isolates hence obtained were designated as EBN- 11 and EBN- 12, respectively. EBN- 12 mutant strain could completely mineralize PNP ( 100 mg/ L) on the minimal media in 24 h while, the parent strain utilized only 6% of it. Addition of glucose as co- substrate further increased the PNP degradation rate; however, phenol inclusion inhibited the degradation process. Ammonium sulphate was experienced as the best of the nitrogen sources used by EBN- 12 mutant strain, while degrading PNP.

AB An anaerobic fixed film reactor was operated at temperatures between 49 and 55-degrees-C, as a thermophilic reactor using actual pharmaceutical wastewater, to observe the effects of temperature and cobalt addition on the performance of the reactor. The reactor was operated with a COD of 2500 mg L-1 at HRT of 4.7 days. COD, TVA, SS, VSS, NH4-N, PO4-P and SO4 were measured. The temperature of 54-degrees-C was found to be the optimum operating temperature with respect to the removal efficiency. Cobalt addition did not affect COD removal and increased gas production but decreased methane percentage.

AB Climbazole (CBZ) and fluconazole (FCZ) belong to the class of azole antifungal drugs that are widely used in medicine and as ingredients of cosmetics, and in result have been frequently detected in municipal and domestic wastewater and in natural watercourses. So far, the behaviour of azole antifungal drugs in constructed wetlands has been scarcely reported. In this study the fate of CBZ and FCZ was investigated in constructed wetlands with various water saturation levels and with or without the vegetation. The experimental column system was operated in outdoor conditions for 122 days and was fed with artificial wastewater containing CBZ or FCZ at 10 mu g/L, each. The removal of FCZ was negligible and the removal of CBZ was >= 90% in unsaturated and partially saturated conditions and in saturated columns with plants. Unvegetated saturated columns provided only moderate removal of CBZ (56%). Plants took up only small portion of FCZ or CBZ (1-2%) as referred to the influent load. Contrasting translocation factor (roots-leaves) was observed for CBZ (TF = 0.1) and FCZ (TF = 4.6). The transformation products of CBZ in the effluents were: reduced CBZ (CBZ-alcohol) and hydroxylated (oxidized) CBZ. CBZ-alcohol was detected in two diasteromers that were quantified throughout the experiment. The ratio of the diastereomers depended on the water saturation level and to a lesser extent on the presence of plants and was in the range from 0.10 for saturated columns to 2.02 in unsaturated columns, which suggested stereoselective formation/degradation reactions. CBZ-alcohol was probably further degraded and its degradation efficiency corresponded to CBZ removal. In contrast to CBZ, CBZ-alcohol was translocated to the above-ground tissues of the plants. The translocation of CBZ-alcohol was deemed a stereoselective process.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is a common anti-microbial ingredient in pharmaceutical and personal care products. The usage of TCS was banned by the United States Food and Drug Administration (in 2016) due to its potential health risks. However, TCS has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Therefore, it is vital to design low-cost and highly efficient photocatalysts to enhance TCS's photocatalytic degradation in wastewater treatment to eliminate its toxicity to environmental health. In this study, we developed a highly efficient catalyst by incorporating lignin nanorods (LNRs) into graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanomaterials as green LNRs/GCN-based nanocomposite photocatalysts for the effective degradation of TCS in waters. LNRs/GCN nanosheets (NSs) and LNRs/GCN-NRs based nanocomposite materials were prepared using a simple wet-impregnation method. The surface morphology and optical properties of as-synthesized materials were well-characterized using FE-SEM, XRD, XPS, and UV-DRS. The photocatalyst (LNRs/GCN-NRs) material showed maximum TCS degradation efficiency of 99.9% and a high rate constant of 0.0661 min(-1) under pH-10 with crucial reactive spices ((OH)-O-center dot and O-center dot(2)-), and excellent cycling performance (over five cycles) within 90 min of UV-light illumination. LNRs/GCN-NRs nanocomposite indicated enhanced photocatalytic performances for TCS degradation due to its strong synergistic effect between LNRs and GCN-NRs as bifunctional catalyst substrate morphology with efficient bandgap energy and accessible active sites compared to LNRs/GCN-NSs. Therefore, LNRs/GCN-NRs nanocomposite was observed to be a highly-active, low-cost, stable, eco-friendly, and efficient photocatalyst for complete degradation of TCS under UV-light irradiation.

AB BACKGROUND Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is commonly considered a promising technology for wastewater treatment due to its outstanding effluent quality, low sludge production, and smaller environmental footprint. However, membrane biofouling is regarded as the bottleneck of MBR processes preventing their universal application. Optimizing operating conditions and improving the antifouling properties of membranes have a substantial impact on the rate and characteristics of membrane fouling in MBR systems.
   RESULTS In this study, a two-step process was performed to mitigate membrane fouling by optimizing sludge retention time (SRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) and improving membrane characteristics in an MBR system developed for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. At first, pure membrane fouling and sludge characteristics were examined in three identical MBRs at different OLRs (40, 100, and 160 mg chemical oxygen demand(COD)/L.d) under various SRTs (7.5, 22.5, and 37.5 days). The investigation indicated that high protein concentration in loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) caused more irreversible fouling at the OLR and SRT of 40 mgCOD/L.d and 7.5 days, respectively. In the second stage, a modified anti-biofouling membrane was installed into the optimized submerged MBR at OLR = 100 mgCOD/L.d and SRT of 22.5 days for further mitigation of membrane fouling. Membrane fouling significantly reduced as the protein and gram negative bacteria on the surface of the modified membrane decreased.
   CONCLUSION The results showed that the reversible and irreversible membrane fouling were controlled successfully through the proposed optimization of operational conditions and by improving the membrane characteristics in MBR. Finally, the protein of LB-EPS is a vitally important factor affecting the irreversible membrane fouling. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)

AB A simple and rapid liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for the determination of 47 different antibiotics in water samples was developed. A straightforward sample preparation of aqueous samples could be established using a simple dilution step with a mixture of water and acetonitrile (+ 0.8 g L-1 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), subsequent filtration through a hydrophilised polytetrafluoroethylene (H-PTFE) syringe filter and a subsequent direct injection. The multi-analyte method presented includes substances from eleven classes of antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, macrolide antibiotics, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, glycopeptid antibiotics, oxazolidinones and nitroimidazoles). The method is characterised by a typical dynamic range from 0.01 mu g L-1 to a maximum of 5 mu g L-1, with good linearity regression coefficients (r(2) > 0.99) and suitable recovery rates (generally from 65 +/- 13 % to 117 +/- 5 %) in spiked drinking water, surface water, groundwater and simulated treated wastewater. Suitable limits of quantification between 3.3 ng L-1 and 190 ng L-1 could be obtained, which are sufficient to determine low levels of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment. The efficiency of the developed method was tested by analysing the residual concentrations of antibiotics in a small creek in Germany ('Swistbach'). Sulfamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim could be detected frequently, with calculated detection frequencies of 94-100 % and 29-47 %, as well as macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin (50-60 %), clarithromycin (82-94 %), clindamycin (88-100 %) and erythromycin (41-53 %). The determined concentrations were in a range between 0.01 mu g L-1 and 0.43 mu g L-1 downstream of the municipal wastewater treatment plants, whereas no antibiotics could be detected upstream.

AB Diatrizoate, a recalcitrant iodinated contrast medium, has been detected in wastewaters and water bodies worldwide, with concentrations in hospital wastewaters in the mu g/L range. Considering that conventional wastewater treatment technologies and ozonation fail to adequately remove diatrizoate, there is a need for researching alternative treatment technologies. In the present work, aqueous solutions of diatrizoate were treated in a compact (7.5 mL liquid volume) non-thermal plasma-liquid reactor. Oxygen and air plasmas were used for diatrizoate removal, with oxygen plasma performing better. After 20 min of treatment of 200 mu g/L diatrizoate in pure water, oxygen led to 90% degradation whereas air achieved only 20% degradation. Two diatrizoate concentrations were studied: 10 mg/L to facilitate the identification of transformation products when using an oxygen plasma and 200 mu g/L, a concentration in the range expected in hospital wastewater. For the oxygen plasma treatment, the energy efficiency for removing diatrizoate was 0.140 g/kWh for C-0 = 10 mg/L and 0.006 g/kWh for C-0 = 200 mu g/L. The following transformation products of diatrizoate were identified: m/z 486A, 504A, 504B, 628, 630A, 630B (previously described in literature) and m/z 486B, 550, 555, 565, 578 (novel). Acute toxicity tests on Aliivibrio fischeri revealed no residual toxicity associated to transformation products. Since diatrizoate is a particularly recalcitrant aqueous organic pollutant, its successful removal and the lack of formation of toxic transformation products indicates that the developed plasma-based technology is promising for treating challenging wastewaters, such as hospital wastewaters.

AB Traces of antibiotics within domestic and industrial effluents have toxic impact on human health as well as surrounding flora and fauna. Potential increase in antibiotic resistance of microorganisms is likely to rise due to the incomplete removal of antibiotics by traditional wastewater processing, methods such as membrane filtration and biological treatment. In this study, we investigated a novel class of material termed Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM) that is based on amorphous microporous organic materials for the application of antibiotic removal form aqueous environments. The adsorption of four commonly used antibiotics (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, and amoxicillin) was evaluated and found that at least 80% of the initial concentrations was eliminated under the optimized conditions. Langmuir and Freundlich models were then employed to correlate the equilibria data; the Freundlich model fit well the data in all cases. For kinetic data, pseudo-first and second order models were examined. Pseudo-second order model fit well the kinetic data and allowed the calculation of the adsorption rate constants. Thermodynamic parameters were obtained by conducting the adsorption studies at varied reaction temperatures. Surface potential, adsorption at various solution pHs, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), and surface area experiments were conducted to draw possible adsorption mechanisms. The removal of antibiotics from water by PIM-1 is likely to be governed by both surface and pore-filling adsorption and could be facilitated by electrostatic interactions between the aromatic rings and charged functional groups as well as hydrogen bond formation between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Our work shows that the application of such novel microporous material could contribute to the removal of such challenging and persistent contaminants from wastewater with further optimizations of large-scale adsorption processes.

AB Prednisolone is a widely prescribed synthetic glucocorticoid and stated to be toxic to a number of non-target aquatic organisms. Its extensive consumption generates environmental concern due to its detection in wastewater samples at concentrations ranged from ng/L to g/L that requests the application of suitable degradation processes. Regarding the actual treatment options, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are presented as a viable alternative. In this work, the comparison in terms of pollutant removal and energetic efficiencies, between different AOPs such as Fenton (F), photo-Fenton (UV/F), photolysis (UV), and hydrogen peroxide/photolysis (UV/H2O2), was carried out. Light diode emission (LED) was the selected source to provide the UV radiation. The UV/F process revealed the best performance, reaching high levels of both degradation and mineralization with low energy consumption. Its optimization was conducted and the operational parameters were iron and H2O2 concentrations and the working volume. Using the response surface methodology with the Box-Behnken design, the effect of independent variables and their interactions on the process response were effectively evaluated. Different responses were analyzed taking into account the prednisolone removal (TOC and drug abatements) and the energy consumptions associated. The obtained model showed an improvement of the UV/F process when treating smaller volumes and when adding high concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+. The validation of this model was successfully carried out, having only 5% of discrepancy between the model and the experimental results. Finally, the performance of the process when having a real wastewater matrix was also tested, achieving complete mineralization and detoxification after 8h. In addition, prednisolone degradation products were identified. Finally, the obtained low energy permitted to confirm the viability of the process.

AB Many industries use dyes and pigments to colour their products. The largest customers of these dyes are textile, tannery, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food processing units and they are in turn the most serious polluters of our environment. The proper treatment of aqueous wastes is fundamental for the preservation of environmental equilibria and the quality of aquatic systems. Electrochemical techniques and adsorption methods offer good potential to remove colour from wastewater. In the present work both the electrochemical and adsorption methods were applied for colour removal and comparative results are presented. Effectiveness of using low cost adsorbent wheat husk was explored.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) released into the environment have an adverse impact on the soil and water ecosystem as well as human health. Sorption of PhACs by soils and its potential modification through introduced DOM in the applied animal manure or treated wastewater (TWW) determines the mobility and environmental relevance of PhACs. Sulfadiazine, caffeine and atenolol were selected as target PhACs to investigate their sorption behaviors by five selected arable soils in the absence and presence of pig manure DOM. Sulfadiazine was least sorbed, followed by caffeine and atenolol according to the Freundlich sorption isotherm fit (soil average K-f [mu g((1-n)) mL(n) g(-1)] 4.07, 9.06, 18.92, respectively). The addition of manure DOM (31.34 mg C L-1) decreased the sorption of sulfadiazine and especially of caffeine and atenolol (average K-f 3.04, 6.17, 5.79, respectively). Freundlich sorption isotherms of the PhACs became more nonlinear in the presence of manure DOM (Freundlich exponent n changed from 0.74-1.40 to 0.62-1.12), implying more heterogeneous sorption of PhACs in soil-DOM binary systems. Sorption competition of DOM molecules with sulfadiazine and caffeine mostly contributed to their decreased soil sorption when DOM was present. In contrast, the formation of DOM-atenolol associates in the solution phase caused the largely decreased soil sorption of atenolol in the presence of DOM. It is suggested that DOM concentration (e.g., >= 60 mg C L-1) and its interaction with PhACs should be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impact of land application of animal manure or irrigation with TWW.

AB This study describes a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical method for the analysis of cytostatic cyclophosphamide (CP), ifosfamide (IF) and their selected metabolites/transformation products (TPs): carboxy-cyclophosphamide (carboxy-CP), keto-cyclophosphamide (keto-CP) and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide/N-dechloroethyl-cyclophosphamide (N-decl-CP) in wastewater (WW). Keto-cyclophosphamide, CP and IF were extracted with Oasis HLB and N-decl-CP and carboxy-CP with Isolute ENV+ cartridges. Analyte derivatization was performed by silylation (metabolites/TPs) and acetylation (CP and IF). The recoveries and LOQs of the developed method were 58, 87 and 103 % and 77.7, 43.7 and 6.7 ng L-1 for carboxy-CP, keto-CP and N-decl-CP, respectively. After validation, the analytical method was applied to hospital WW and influent and effluent samples of a receiving WW treatment plant. In hospital WW, levels up to 2690, 47.0, 13,200, 2100 and 178 ng L-1 were detected for CP, IF, carboxy-CP, N-decl-CP and keto-CP, respectively, while in influent and effluent samples concentrations were below LOQs. The formation of TPs during abiotic treatments was also studied. Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify CP and IF TPs in ultrapure water, treated with UV and UV/H2O2. UV treatment produced four CP TPs and four IF TPs, while UV/H2O2 resulted in five CPs and four IF TPs. Besides already known TPs, three novel TPs (CP-TP138a, imino-ifosfamide and IF-TP138) have been tentatively identified. In hospital WW treated by UV/O-3/H2O2, none of the target metabolites/TPs resulted above LOQs.

AB A hybrid ultrafiltration-osmotic membrane bioreactor (UFO-MBR) was investigated for over 35 days for nutrient and trace organic chemical (TOrC) removal from municipal wastewater. The UFO-MBR system uses both ultrafiltration (UF) and forward osmosis (FO) membranes in parallel to simultaneously extract clean water from an activated sludge reactor for nonpotable (or environmental discharge) and potable reuse, respectively. In the FO stream, water is drawn by osmosis from activated sludge through an FO membrane into a draw solution (DS), which becomes diluted during the process. A reverse osmosis (RO) system is then used to reconcentrate the diluted DS and produce clean water suitable for direct potable reuse. The UF membrane extracts water, dissolved salts, and some nutrients from the system to prevent their accumulation in the activated sludge of the osmotic MBR. The UF permeate can be used for nonpotable reuse purposes (e.g., irrigation and toilet flushing). Results from UFO-MBR investigation illustrated that the chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus removals were greater than 99%, 82%, and 99%, respectively. Twenty TOrCs were detected in the municipal wastewater that was used as feed to the UFO-MBR system. Among these 20 TOrCs, 15 were removed by the hybrid UFO-MBR system to below the detection limit. High FO membrane rejection was observed for all ionic and nonionic hydrophilic TOrCs and lower rejection was observed for nonionic hydrophobic TOrCs. With the exceptions of bisphenol A and DEET, all TOrCs that were detected in the DS were well rejected by the RO membrane. Overall, the UFO-MBR can operate sustainably and has the potential to be utilized for direct potable reuse applications

AB This study investigated the advanced treatment of secondary effluent organic matters (EfOM) from an industrial park wastewater treatment plant (IPWTP) by Fenton oxidation process and its combination with biological aerated filter (BAF). The constituents of EfOM were characterized by using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix, and the results showed that the major components included aromatic proteins, soluble microbial products, humic and fulvic acid-like substances, and compounds associated with fluorescent region of Ex 250-300 nm/Em 600-700 nm. The EfOM was strongly resistant to biodegradation (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio at 0.11), resulting in less than 15% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiency by the BAF reactor. The advanced treatment of EfOM by Fenton oxidation process led to maximum similar to 50% mineralization efficiency of EfOM under the optimal conditions of 2.0 mM Fe-II, 10 mM H2O2, pH 3.0 and 3.0 h of the reaction time. Particularly, Fenton oxidation treatment effectively improved the biodegradability of EfOM in the IPWTP secondary effluents, e.g., increasing the BOD5:COD ratio from 0.11 to 0.42. A synergistic combination of Fenton oxidation process with the BAF reactor offered desirable mineralization efficiencies of EfOM (>70%) at lower dosages of Fenton's reagents. The present results suggest that Fenton oxidation process combining with the BAF reactor can be a promising strategy for the advanced treatment of EfOM in IPWTP secondary effluents. This study provides guidance for the characterization and advanced treatment of EfOM in IPWTP secondary effluents for practical purpose. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin, a pharmaceutically active compound, is present as a micropollutant in wastewater, which cannot be removed by conventional techniques due to its recalcitrant nature. Therefore, in the present study, the photocatalytic degradation of this bio-toxic compound was demonstrated using a three-dimensional sulfur-doped graphitic-carbon nitride/zinc oxide hybrid, with enriched oxygen vacancies. The influence of various water matrices and experimental conditions on the ciprofloxacin degradation was optimized. The hybrid material showed 98.8% and 75.8% degradation efficiency under optimum experimental conditions (i.e., catalyst dose: 1 g/L; pH: 5; initial ciprofloxacin concentration: 20 mg/L; temperature: 27 ?C) under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light, respectively. A neural-network-based multivariate approach was used to predict a significant model considering the experimental conditions that showed adequate statistical significance (R2: 0.992 and F-value: 8707.1). The relative significance of the experimental conditions was assessed, suggesting that the initial ciprofloxacin concentration has a more significant effect on the degradation efficiency than the other factors. The rate kinetics and reaction mechanisms for ciprofloxacin degradation were demonstrated, and the driving radicals involved were identified. A higher rate of reaction was found under UV irradiation (0.01702 min- 1) than under visible light (0.00802 min-1). Superoxide radicals were identified as the main driving radicals, which caused substantial photocatalytic reactions among the hybrid and ciprofloxacin molecules. Microscopic and macroscopic analyses of the used hybrid were conducted, which confirmed the presence of higher defect concentrations, crystallinity, and interlinked stacked structure in the hybrid. Hence, the 3D hybrid can be efficiently used and reused for ciprofloxacin degradation. This advanced photocatalytic system can be widely used to remediate emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment.

AB A passive water sampler based on the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique was developed and tested for 3 groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs, including oestrogens, alkyl-phenols and bisphenols). Three different resins (hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB), XAD18 and Strata-XL-A (SXLA)) were investigated for their suitability as the binding phase for DGT devices. Laboratory tests across a range of pH (3.5-9.5), ionic strength (0.001-0.5 M) and dissolved organic matter concentration (0-20 mg L-1) showed HLB and XAD18-DGT devices were more stable compared to SXLA-DGT. HLB-DGT and XAD18-DGT accumulated test chemicals with time consistent with theoretical predictions, while SXLA-DGT accumulated reduced amounts of chemical. DGT performance was also compared in field deployments up to 28 days, alongside conventional active sampling at a wastewater treatment plant Uptake was linear to the samplers over 18 days, and then began to plateau/decline, indicating the maximum deployment time in those conditions. Concentrations provided by the DGT samplers compared well with those provided by auto-samplers. DGT integrated concentrations over the deployment period in a way that grab-sampling cannot. The advantages of the DGT sampler over active sampling include: low cost, ease of simultaneous multi-site deployment, in situ analyte pre-concentration and reduction of matrix interferences compared with conventional methods. Compared to other passive sampler designs, DGT uptake is independent of flow rate and therefore allows direct derivation of field concentrations from measured compound diffusion coefficients. This passive DGT sampler therefore constitutes a viable and attractive alternative to conventional grab and active water sampling for routine monitoring of selected EDCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water bodies in densely populated lowland areas are commonly affected by pollution from agricultural activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges, yet the selection of appropriate water quality assessment methods for these water bodies is under debate. Therefore, we aimed to 1) compare the ability of structural and functional metrics to detect adverse effects of anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems and 2) assess the ability of trait-based metrics to diagnose the potential causes of the observed adverse effects in water quality assessment. Specifically, we compared the responses of several structural (both taxonomic and trait-based) and functional (i.e., based on ecological processes) metrics across a series of stressors in 20 lowland water bodies affected to varying degrees by agricultural activities and WWTP discharges. The measured stressors included nutrients, dissolved oxygen saturation, water temperature, and proxies for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. Taxa evenness and the trait-based SPEcies At Risk organic (SPEAR(organic)) and pesticide (SPEAR(pesticide)) metrics were negatively correlated with the proxy for organic toxicants. Microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption showed opposite and more complex relationships with the stressors. These findings suggest that functional metrics may detect patterns of anthropogenic stress that are not evident from structural metrics alone. In terms of diagnostic value, our results indicated that both SPEAR metrics may be used to diagnose the combined presence of organic toxicants from agricultural activities and WWTP discharges, although the SPEAR approach may need to be combined with other methods. We conclude that structural (both taxonomic and trait-based) and functional metrics may provide complementary information that, when integrated, allows for more thorough water quality assessment strategies.

AB Artificial sweeteners (ASs) are applied widely as sucrose substitutes in food, pharmaceuticals, and personal-care products, which results in their release into surface water. The occurrence of ASs in aquatic environments in China has rarely been reported. In this study, we determined the concentration of seven ASs in surface water and sediment samples from 16 lakes in Wuhan. The sum of the ASs concentration ranged from 0.89 to 20.6 mu g/L in the surface water, with a mean value of 4.96 +/- 5.16 mu g/L. The most abundant AS was sucralose (SUC), with a concentration from 0.33 to 18.0 mu g/L, followed by acesulfame (ACE) (0.40-2.78 mu g/L), saccharin (SAC) (< MDL to 1.86 mu g/L), and cyclamate (CYC) (< MDL to 2.22 mu g/L). SUC and ACE accounted for 90% +/- 8% of the total ASs in the surface water. The Sigma(4) ASs sediment concentrations ranged from 1.71 to 6.49 ng/g of the dry weight (dw, mean value 3.03 +/- 1.03 ng/g dw). SAC, CYC, and ACE were detected in sediments (< MDL to 4.17 ng/g dw), with SAC as the dominant AS. In surface water, the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations of Hanyang station were higher than those of Hankou, while the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations in sediment samples from different regions showed no significant difference. The ASs concentrations in the surface water and sediment in winter were significantly higher than those in summer. Relatively higher concentrations and detected frequencies of SUC and ACE were found in surface water samples, whereas these two ASs were absent in background samples, which indicates that SUC and ACE can be used as potential indicators of wastewater contamination in Wuhan, China.

   Glucocorticoid receptor; Municipal wastewater effluent; Antidepressant
AB Ubiquitous use of antidepressants has resulted in increased concentrations of these pharmaceuticals in waterways receiving municipal wastewater effluent. Amongst these, venlafaxine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is commonly found at concentrations surpassing 1 ppb in surface waters. We recently showed that the deposition of venlafaxine in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos impacts neural development in the hypothalamus, suggesting the possibility of neuroendocrine disruptions due to this antidepressant. Here, we tested the hypothesis that early developmental exposure to venlafaxine disrupts the long-term functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in zebrafish. Embryos (1-4 cell stage) were injected with either 0, 1, or 10 ng venlafaxine, and the ontogeny of cortisol content, as well as changes in cortisol levels following a stressor in larvae and adults were assessed across 3 generations. Zygotic venlafaxine exposure did not affect the ontogeny of cortisol production, but there was a disruption in the cortisol response to stressor exposure, which was also evident in multiple generations. In the F-0 generation, venlafaxine exposure did not affect cortisol levels in response to stressor exposure in larvae, but adult females, and not males, showed an attenuated cortisol response compared to control fish. This reduction in cortisol levels in the females was rescued by stimulation with adrenocorticotropic hormone, suggesting that the disruption was at the level of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Venlafaxine-mediated disruption in HPI axis functioning was also evident in the F-1 and F-2 generations, including impaired cortisol responses to a stressor in adult female and larval fish, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that venlafaxine is an endocrine disruptor, and early developmental exposure to this antidepressant may have long-term and generational consequences on cortisol stress axis activity in zebrafish.

AB Residual trace organic pollutants (TOPs) and associated biological effects from secondary effluent (SE) are attracting much attention because of their safety concerns. Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, due to its low cost and high efficiency, is widely applied for further wastewater treatment, but its selective removals of TOPs and biological effects are poorly understood. In the present study, the surface physicochemical characteristics of four types of typical GACs were investigated, and their correlation with luminescent bacteria toxicity was discussed. Based on the biological effect control, shell GAC, with a great adsorption capacity and high functional group contents was selected for further study, including for the removal of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM), 21 TOPs, and 3 biological effects. The shell GAC showed a promising property of removing fluorescent DOM and TOPs. The total concentration of 21 detected TOPs, including 12 pesticides and 9 pharmaceuticals, achieved 82% removal when 30 g/L. shell GACs was added. Individual chemicals removal by GAC adsorption was not well described by an individual parameter (e.g., logD, molecular size, charge, functional groups), but rather by a variety of physical and chemical interactions among TOPs, DOM, and GAC. The biological effects from SE were mainly caused by TOPs and DOM. Hence, shell GACs also showed high removal efficiencies of luminescent bacteria toxicity, genotoxicity, and photosynthetic inhibition effect. The removal mechanisms of the three biological effects from SE were deeply discussed. Therefore, the GAC treatment is considered to be one of the most suitable options to ensure the ecological safety of discharged wastewater, because it can effectively control DOM, TOPs, and associated biological effects.

AB Research background. The occurrence and environmental toxicity of pharmaceuticals have recently attracted increasing attention. Diclofenac is a highly consumed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which is often detected in wastewaters, but investigations of its influence on bacteria are scarce.
   Experimental approach. We investigated the influence of this pharmaceutical on bacterial community in activated sludge exposed to increasing concentrations of diclofenac in fed-batch reactors over 41 days. Nitrification activity of the activated sludge was measured and changes in bacterial community structure were followed using culture-independent molecular method (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) and by the cultivation approach.
   Results and conclusions. Nitrification activity was not detectably influenced by the addition of diclofenac, while the main change of the bacterial community structure was detected only at the end of incubation (after41 days) when diclofenac was added to artificial wastewater as the only carbon source. Changes in community composition due to enrichment were observed using cultivation approach. However, taxonomic affiliation of isolates did not match taxons identified by T-RFLP community profiling. Isolates obtained from activated sludge used as inoculum belonged to five genera: Comamonas, Arthrobacter, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter and Aeromonas, known for their potential to degrade aromatic compounds. However, only Pseudomonas species were isolated after the last enrichment step on minimal agar plates with diclofenac added as the sole carbon source.
   Novelty and scientific contribution. Our results suggest that the selected recalcitrant and commonly detected pharmaceutical does not strongly influence the sensitive and important nitrification process of wastewater treatment. Moreover, the isolated strains obtained after enrichment procedure that were able to grow on minimal agar plates with diclofenac added as the only carbon source could serve as potential model bacteria to study bacterial diclofenac degradation.

Among these investigated SPE types, the best recoveries for 19 target ADs were obtained from Oasis HLB cartridge with 37-102%, 45-103%, 37-88%, 28-82% and 31-90% for spiked river water, tap water, rainwater, wastewater, and sediment respectively (with RSD < 15%), except for closanteL The 19 ADs were separated within 10 min by a BEH C18 column and monitored in both positive and negative ions modes with switching electrospray ionization source. The cross-talk interferences were solved by identification of secondary mass spectrum of substances through MRM-IDA-EPI scanning using Qtrap. These interference peaks could be efficiently eliminated by setting MRM segments or using Qtrap to obtain tertiary fragmented information. The developed methods were satisfactory in terms of linearity, accuracy, and precision, and used eight isotopically labeled compounds as internal standards to correct matrix effects. Method quantification limit (MQL) for 19 ADs was below 1.1 ng/L, OA ng/L, 5.4 ng/L and 23 ng/g for river water, tap water, wastewater, and sediment, respectively. The validated method was successfully used to investigate the occurrence of anthelmintics in water and sediment samples from Chengdu, China. All ADs were detected in environment with the concentrations at ng/L level. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) was synthesized for the adsorption of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), including [C(4)mim] [Cl], [C(8)mim][Cl] and [C(16)mim] [Cl]. To clarify the adsorption mechanism, three carbonaceous materials coconut-shell-based activated carbon (CSAC), coal-based activated carbon (F300) and ordered mesoporous carbon material (CMK-3) were also prepared as additional sorbents. The sorbents were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements in terms of structural and surface characteristics. Batch adsorption tests indicated that the CSAC exhibited a high adsorption capacity for short-alkyl-chain [C(4)mim] [Cl], originating from the micropore-filling effect. ZTC displayed a markedly higher adsorption capacity for long alkyl-chained [C(16)mim][Cl] compared with other tested sorbents due to its regular-shaped, open and interconnected channel structure, as well as the good matching between pore size and adsorbate dimension. The uniform pore structure also endowed ZTC and CMK-3 with considerably faster adsorption kinetics for [C(16)mim] [Cl] than the activated carbons. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the uptake of [C(16)mim] [Cl] on ZTC was spontaneous physical adsorption. [C(16)mim] [Cl] adsorption was enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous solution and was slightly influenced by the solution pH. Additionally, ZTC was easily regenerated with ethyl alcohol for reuse for at least ten times. Thus, the findings demonstrated that ZTC is an ideal candidate for the adsorptive removal of long-alkyl-chain ILs from water and wastewater.

AB Coagulation has been widely applied as a pretreatment for ultrafiltration (UF) membrane in wastewater reclamation, however, it is unable to effectively ensure the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and genotoxicity. To solve this problem, oxidant ferrate (VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe-VI) was combined with coagulant poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) as the pretreatment of UF to treat secondary effluent, and three oxidant dosing strategies (namely oxidation followed by coagulation (O-Fe-VI-PAC), simultaneous oxidation and coagulation (SeFeVI-PAC), and coagulation followed by oxidation (C-PAC-Fe-VI)) were compared at two oxidant doses. The results showed that C-PAC-Fe-VI pretreatment exhibited the best performance for the removal of DOC (35.9%), UV254 (33.7%), protein (71.8%), and polysaccharide (22.1%). Molecular weight and fluorescence analysis revealed that the removed organics were mainly humic substances. Both the direct UF process and PAC pretreatment showed limited removal of OMPs and genotoxicity, however, the combined pretreatments of Fe-VI and PAC dramatically removed them. The maximum removal efficiency of the fourteen selected OMPs and genotoxicity was obtained under SeFeVI-PAC (59.6% on average) and C-PAC-Fe-VI (84.1%), respectively. With respect to membrane fouling control, the normalized flux reduction showed an apparent regularity of C-PAC-Fe-VI > OeFe(VI)-PAC > SeFeVI-PAC, however, Fe-VI dose should be carefully determined. The addition of Fe-VI delayed the transition of membrane fouling mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration, especially in C-PAC-Fe-VI pretreatment, which was confirmed by the fluorescence characterization of hydraulic reversible and hydraulic irreversible foulants. To sum up, C-PAC-Fe-VI dosing strategy seems to have more potential in membrane fouling alleviation and effluent quality improvement. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are emerging pollutants causing serious challenges to wastewater treatment plants due to poor biodegradability. In this study, the enhanced removal of highly recalcitrant and commonly monitored PhACs, carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) by heterogeneous photocatalysis was investigated using 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst. The photocatalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS). The effects of catalyst dose, initial pollutants concentration, and mineralization during the photocatalytic degradation of PhACs were investigated. The matrix effect was assessed in deionized water (DW) and real membrane bioreactor effluent (RME). Optimal CBZ and DCF removals of 89.10% and 93.5%, respectively for 180 min of UV irradiation were achieved at catalyst dosage of 0.4 g L-1 in DW matrix. However, the optimal catalyst dosages for CBZ and DCF in RME matrix were increased by factor 2 and 1.5, respectively, to achieve the same degree of removal. Declining trends of removal rate were observed when initial concentrations of both the PhACs were increased under optimal catalyst dosages, and kinetics seem to fit the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Photo-induced holes and (OH)-O-center dot were the dominant oxidation species involved in the photocatalytic degradation of the PhACs. A plausible reusability of 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst was observed for both the PhACs. Moreover, various aromatic/aliphatic intermediates generated during the photodegradation CBZ were identified using fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, and a possible multi-step degradation pathway was proposed. Overall, the removal of PhACs using 5% Ag2O/P-25 photocatalyst showed promising results in real wastewater.

AB The development of efficient materials for removing pharmaceuticals from water has been a matter of great concern. As a new class of porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable attention in the field of environmental remediation. In this article, a photocatalytic adsorbent MIL-53(Fe) was successfully prepared by solvothermal method and used for the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals clofibric acid (CA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) from water. MIL-53(Fe) exhibited good adsorption performance and the maximum adsorption capacities of CA and CBZ are about 0.80 mmol/g and 0.57 mmol/g, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms of CA and CBZ are mainly due to electrostatic interaction and pi-pi interaction, respectively. Further, MIL-53(Fe) exhibited high photocatalytic activity and stability under visible light. The photocatalytic efficiency could be improved significantly with the addition of a small amount of H2O2, and the corresponding photodegradation efficiencies for CA and CBZ both reached up to 90%, which are higher than those of Fe(II)/H2O2 and TiO2 under visible light. The photocatalytic performance was strongly dependent on the solution pH. The Fenton-like reaction, charge carriers directly generated in the photo-excited MIL-53(Fe) and the synergistic effect of H2O2 were the main mechanisms. The formation of humic acids-like and fulvic acids-like organic matter in the degradation process was detected by 3D EMMs. MIL-53(Fe) also revealed excellent performance for the removal of CA and CBZ from real municipal wastewater and river water. Therefore, MIL-53(Fe) may be used as a promising photocatalytic adsorbent for wastewater purification. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The extensive use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and their subsequent release into the environment may have direct consequences for autochthonous bacterial communities, especially in freshwater ecosystems. In small streams and rivers, local inputs of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may become important sources of organic matter, nutrients and emerging pollutants, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this study, we evaluated the effect of WWTP effluents as a source of ARGs in river biofilms. The prevalence of genes conferring resistance to main antibiotic families, such as beta-lactams (bla(CTX-M)), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), sulfonamides (sul I), and macrolides (ermB), was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in biofilm samples collected upstream and downstream WWTPs discharge points in four low-order streams. Our results showed that the WWTP effluents strongly modified the hydrology, physico-chemistry and biological characteristics of the receiving streams and favoured the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance in microbial benthic communities. It was also shown that the magnitude of effects depended on the relative contribution of each WWTP to the receiving system. Specifically, low concentrations of ARGs were detected at sites located upstream of the WWTPs, while a significant increase of their concentrations was observed in biofilms collected downstream of the WWTP discharge points (particularly ermB and sill I genes). These findings suggest that WWTP discharges may favour the increase and spread of antibiotic resistance among streambed biofilms. The present study also showed that the presence of ARGs in biofilms was noticeable far downstream of the WWTP discharge (up to 1 km). It is therefore reasonable to assume that biofilms may represent an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance determinants and thus be considered suitable biological indicators of anthropogenic pollution by active pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Understanding groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions is vital for water management in karstic catchments due to its impact on water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the applicability of seven environmental tracers to quantify and localize groundwater exfiltration into a small, human-impacted karstic river system. Tracers were selected based on their emission source to the surface water either as (a) dissolved, predominantly geogenic compounds (radon-222, sulphate and electrical conductivity) or (b) anthropogenic compounds (predominantly) originating from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents (carbamazepine, tramadol, sodium, chloride). Two contrasting sampling approaches were compared (a) assuming steady-state flow conditions and (b) considering the travel time of the water parcels (Lagrangian sampling) through the catchment to account for diurnal changes in inflow from the WWTP. Spatial variability of the concentrations of all tracers indicated sections of preferential groundwater inflow. Lagrangian sampling techniques seem highly relevant for capturing dynamic concentration patterns of WWTP-derived compounds. Quantification of GW inflow with the finite element model FINIFLUX, based on observed in-stream Rn activities led to plausible fluxes along the investigated river reaches (0.265 m(3)s(-1)), while observations of other natural or anthropogenic environmental tracers produced less plausible water fluxes. Important point sources of groundwater exfiltration can be ascribed to locations where the river crosses geological fault lines. This indicates that commonly applied concepts describing groundwater-surface water interactions assuming diffuse flow in porous media are difficult to transfer to karstic river systems whereas concepts from fractured aquifers may be more applicable. In general, this study helps selecting the best suited hydrological tracer for GW exfiltration and leads to a better understanding of processes controlling groundwater inflow into karstic river systems.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are released into the environment clue to their poor removal during wastewater treatment. Agricultural soils subject to irrigation with wastewater effluent and biosolids application are possible reservoirs for these chemicals. This study examined the impact of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ), and the antimicrobial agents triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) on four soil microbial communities using shotgun sequencing (HiSeq Illumina) with the overall aim of determining possible degraders as well as the functional genes related to general xenobiotic degradation. The biodegradation of CBZ and TCC was slow, with <= 50% decrease during the 80-day incubation period. In contrast, TCS biodegradation was rapid, with similar to 80% removal in 25 days. For each chemical, when all four soils were considered together, between three and ten phylotypes (from multiple phyla) were more abundant in the soil samples compared to the live controls. The genera of a number of previously reported CBZ, TCC or TCS degrading isolates were present: Rhodococcus (CBZ), Streptomyces (CBZ), Pseudomonas (CBZ, TCC, TCS), Sphingomonas (TCC, TCS), Methylobacillus (TCS) and Stenotrophomonas (TCS) were among the most abundant (chemical previously reported to be degraded is shown in parenthesis). From the analysis of xenobiotic degrading pathways, genes from five KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Orthology pathways were the most dominant, including those associated with aminobenzoate, benzoate (most common), chloroyclohexane/chlorobenzene, dioxin and nitrotoluene biodegradation. Several phylotypes including Brodythizobium, Mycobacterium, Rhodopseudornonas, Pseudomonas, Cupriavidus, and Streptomyces were common genera associated with these pathways. Overall, the data suggest several phylotypes are likely involved in the biodegradation of these PPCPs with Pseudomonas being an important genus. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has received wide attention, and they have recently been considered as emerging organic contaminants. Since conventional wastewater processes are not particularly effective, the development of new technology that can completely remove pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments is an urgent need. Recently, iron-copper bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention, and they are known as good Fenton reagents for the degradation of persistent organic pollutants. In this study, yolk-shell structured Fe3O4@SiO2 was prepared via a spontaneous self-transformation process, and it was decorated with copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu) to produce a novel catalyst aimed at the rapid catalytic oxidation of acetaminophen in the heterogeneous Fenton reaction. Different ratios of Fe3O4 and copper were obtained by varying the precursor amounts of yolk-shell and copper salt. The catalyst properties were characterized by several techniques to verify the successful synthesis of the targeted materials. The results demonstrated that the Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu was controllably prepared, copper nanoparticles were firmly immobilized on the mesoporous silica shell, and the decoration of copper did not impact the yolk-shell structure of the precursor material. The catalytic activity of Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu was much better than that of Fe3O4@SiO2 for the degradation of acetaminophen. The catalytic performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu increased with increasing copper content. Radical scavenging studies showed that center dot OH is the main reactive species contributing to acetaminophen degradation. In addition, the catalyst also exhibited good separation and satisfactory regeneration properties. The decoration of copper nanoparticles onto the yolk-shell structure Fe3O4@SiO2 was proved to be an attractive alternative method to obtain a novel bimetallic catalyst applied in heterogeneous Fenton-like system for the removal of persistent pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Bicarbonate anion (HCO3-) is a major constituent in wastewater and natural water matrices, and the aim of this study was to investigate its roles in the degradation of the antineoplastic agent methotrexate via UV/TiO2. A comprehensive investigation of reaction mechanisms was performed by conducting scavenger experiments and substructure reactivity and Microtox (R) toxicity tests. In the presence of HCO3-, the methotrexate degradation rate substantially increased, indicating the involvement of (CO3-)-C-center dot. The estimated second-order rate constants of methotrexate with (CO3-)-C-center dot and (OH)-O-center dot were 1.4 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) and 8.7 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Both the valence hole (h(vb)(+)) and (OH)-O-center dot resulted in the generation of (CO3-)-C-center dot. Initial transformation pathways of methotrexate were proposed, including the addition of atomic oxygen, hydroxylation, deamination, C-C cleavage and C-N cleavage. C-N cleavage at the aniline moiety (the N(13) position) is the primary decomposition pathway, leading to an aminopterin yield of 43%. (CO3-)-C-center dot preferentially reacted with the 4-aminobenzamide (ABZ) moiety and generated toxic byproducts during the later stages of decomposition, which was not observed in the UV/TiO2 system. The reactivity of the three methotrexate substructures decreased in the following order in the presence of HCO3-: ABZ >> DHP >> LG similar to 0; however, without HCO3-, the following order was observed: ABZ similar to DHP > LG. The results of this work suggest that the increase in toxicity induced by the presence of HCO3- likely occurs in many other (OH)-O-center dot-based advanced oxidation processes in wastewater containing pharmaceutical cocktails with ABZ moieties.

AB Mineralization of organics in secondary effluent by the peroxone process was studied at a direct potable water reuse research treatment system serving an occupied four-bedroom, four bath university residence hall apartment. Organic concentrations were measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and kinetic runs were monitored at varying O-3/H2O2 dosages and ratios. COD degradation could be accurately described as the parallel pseudo-1st order decay of rapidly and slowly-oxidizable fractions, and effluent COD was reduced to below the detection limit (<0.7 mg/L). At dosages >= 4.6 mg L-1 h(-1), an O-3/H2O2 mass ratio of 3.4-3.8, and initial COD <20 mg/L, a simple first order decay was indicated for both single-passed treated wastewater and recycled mineral water, and a relationship is proposed and demonstrated to estimate the pseudo-first order rate constant for design purposes. At this O-3/H2O2 mass ratio, ORP and dissolved ozone were found to be useful process control indicators for monitoring COD mineralization in secondary effluent. Moreover, an average second order rate constant for OH center dot oxidation of secondary effluent organics (measured as MCOD) was found to be 1.24 x 10(7) +/- 0.64 x 10(7) M-1 S-1. The electric energy demand of the peroxone process is estimated at 1.73-2.49 kWh electric energy for removal of one log COD in 1 m(3) secondary effluent, comparable to the energy required for desalination of medium strength seawater. Advantages/disadvantages of the two processes for municipal wastewater reuse are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The documented presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water sources has prompted a global interest in understanding their environmental fate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can potentially alter the fate of these contaminants in aqueous systems by forming contaminant-DOM complexes. In-situ measurements were made to assess the interactions between three common PPCP contaminants and two distinct DOM sources: a wastewater treatment plant (WWOM) and the Suwannee River, GA (SROM). Aqueous DOM solutions (8.0 mg L-1 C, pH 7.4) were spiked with a range of concentrations of bisphenol-A, carbamazepine and ibuprofen to assess the DOM fluorophores quenched by PPCP interaction in excitation-emission matrices (EEM). Interaction effects on target analyte (PPCP) concentrations were also quantified using direct aqueous injection ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). At low bisphenol-A concentration, WVVOM fluorescence was quenched in an EEM region attributed to microbial by product-like and humic acid-like DOM components, whereas carbamazepine and ibuprofen quenched fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Fluorescence quenching of SROM by bisphenol-A and carbamazepine was centered on humic acid-like components, whereas ibuprofen quenched the fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Nearly complete LC-MS/MS recovery of all three contaminants was obtained, irrespective of analyte structure and DOM source, indicating relatively weak PPCP-DOM bonding interactions. The results suggest that presence of DOM at environmentally-relevant concentration can give rise to PPCP interactions that could potentially affect their environmental transport, but these DOM-contaminant interactions do not suppress the accurate assessment of target analyte concentrations by aqueous injection LC-MS/MSMS.

AB The photo-Fenton process was performed with four radiation settings to treat clinical analysis laboratory wastewater (CALWW) from a hospital, with the aim of evaluating its treatability and acute toxicity response in Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. The experiments were performed in a borosilicate bench-scale conventional reactor for 320 min. The light radiation was suspended 13 cm from the CALWW surface for mild radiation or immersed into the matrix for intense radiation. All photo-Fenton experimental conditions were set at pH 3.0, 15 mg L-1 of Fe2+, and initial H2O2 of 300 mg L-1. The initial Fe2+ concentration was converted to Fe3+ ion in the first 15 min of photooxidation for all processes. Furthermore, the intense radiation processes regenerated Fe2+ faster than other systems. Neither mild UVA-Vis nor mild UVC-Vis radiation significantly treated the organic matter or phenols. However, mild UVC-Vis resulted in a higher biodegradability transformation rate (biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand 0.51), indicating that it could treat more recalcitrant organic matter than mild UVA-Vis. Intense radiation proved to be more efficient, with a chemical oxygen demand removal rate of 95% for intense UVA-Vis and 99% for intense UVC-Vis treatments. All treatments reduced acute toxicity in D. magna. Moreover, photo-Fenton treatment by intense UVA-Vis decreased toxicity similar to 98%, compared to mild and intense UVC-Vis, similar to 75%. Both of the mild radiation treatments inhibited the germination of L. sativa seeds. The intense UVA-Vis photo-Fenton treatment was the only setting that removed phytotoxicity, resulting in a non-significant effect, and the intense UVC-Vis treatment inhibited the seed growth.

AB Better understanding of the fate and persistence of trace organic contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in agricultural soils is critical for assessing the risks associated with using treated wastewater effluent to irrigate crops and land application of wastewater biosolids. This study reports on the influence of prevailing terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs, i.e., aerobic, nitrate-reducing, iron(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing conditions) and exposure to a mixture of nine trace CEC (90 ng/g each) on both the microbial community structure and CEC degradation in agricultural soil. DNA analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community composition following establishment of different TEAPs, but no significant change upon exposure to the mixture of CEC. The largest community shift was observed after establishing nitrate-reducing conditions and the smallest shift for sulfate-reducing conditions. Two of the CEC (atrazine and sulfamethoxazole) showed significant degradation in both bioactive and abiotic (i.e., sterilized) conditions, with half-lives ranging from 1 to 64 days for different TEAPs, while six of the CEC (amitriptyline, atenolol, trimethoprim, and three organophosphate flame retardants) only degraded in bioactive samples, with half-lives ranging from 27 to 90 days; carbamazepine did not degrade appreciably within 90 days in any of the incubations. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Firmicutes Hydrogenispora, Gemmatimonadetes Gemmatimonadaceae, and Verrucomicrobia OPB34 soil group were identified as potentially responsible for the biodegradation of organophosphate flame retardants, and ASVs from other taxa groups were suspected to be involved in biodegrading the other target CEC. These results demonstrate that CEC fate and persistence in agricultural soils is influenced by the prevailing TEAPs and their influence on the microbial community, suggesting the need to incorporate these factors into contaminant fate models to improve risk assessment predictions.

AB Ketamine has been increasingly used both recreationally and medicinally around the world. Although the metabolic pathways to form its metabolite norketamine have been carefully investigated in humans and animals, knowledge of their environmental occurrence and fate is limited. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of ketamine and norketamine in 20 natural bodies of water, effluents from 13 hospitals, two wastewater treatment plants and one water supply plant. Ketamine was found at concentrations as high as 10 mu g/L. Ketamine and norketamine were consistently found in similar concentrations (ketamine/norketamine ratio: 0.3-4.6) in the collected water samples, and this ratio similar to that found in urine samples. Dark incubation experiments have shown that ketamine is not susceptible to microbial degradation or hydrolysis. Phototransformation was demonstrated to significantly reduce the concentration of ketamine and norketamine in river waters (t(1/2) = 12.6 +/- 0.4 and 10.1 +/- 0.4 h, respectively) and resulted in byproducts that are similar to human metabolites. Both direct and indirect photolysis led to the N-demethylation of ketamine to form norketamine and other byproducts, including hydroxynorketamine (HNK), dehydronorketamine (DNK), hydroxy-ketamine (HK) and isomer forms of ketamine and norketamine. Irradiated solutions exhibited higher toxicity (via the Microtox (R) test). Although a final risk assessment could not be made due to a lack of studies on the chronic effects on aquatic organisms, the high and persistent environmental occurrences of ketamine and norketamine as well as the increasingly acute toxicity of the photo byproducts demonstrate the importance of including metabolites in evaluation of the overall risk of ketamine.

AB The photochemical formation of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) from effluent organic matter (EfOM) depends upon the chemical properties of this heterogeneous mixture. In this study, two EfOM samples collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP A and B) were fractionated by both hydrophobicity (bulk and non-humic) and apparent molecular weight (A/v1W). The apparent quantum yield for HO center dot formation ((Phi(center dot)(HO)) and the maximum fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)) were subsequently measured for each subfraction. The formation rates of HO center dot (considering only the 10 hydrogen-peroxide-independent pathways) for the bulk waters were 4.8 X 10(-10) and 9.6 X M s(-1) for WVVTP A and B, respectively. For the AMW fractions, the values of Phi(center dot)(HO) increased as the AIVIVV of the material decreased. For the W1NTP A sample, the Phi(center dot)(HO) increased from 2.54 x 10(-4) (bulk water) to 6.29 X 10(-4) for the <I kDa fraction, and for the WVVTP B sample, the value of Phi(center dot)(HO) increased from 6.50 x 10(-5) for bulk water to 3.45 X 10(-4) for the <1 kDa fraction. In the case of fluorescence, the values of Phi(F) ranged from 2.37 X 10(-4) (bulk water) to 3.48 X 10(-4) (<1 kDa fraction) for WVVTP A and 3.19 X 10(-4) (bulk water) to 5.75 X 10(-4) (<1 kDa fraction) for WWTP B. There was a linear correlation between Phi(center dot)(HO) and Phi(F), suggesting that different photophysical processes occur in the chemical components of the fractions. Understanding the formation of HO' from EfOM is essential for understanding wastewater-impacted aquatic systems because these results influence the photochemical degradation and mineralization of trace organic contaminants.

AB Pharmaceutical pollutants have become a worldwide concern. These emerging contaminants (ECs) are ubiquitously found in different water streams with concentrations above ecotoxicity endpoints, deteriorating aquatic life and water quality. This study evaluated extensively the efficacy of porous graphene (PG) synthesised at relatively low temperature as a potential candidate for the removal of six widely utilised pharmaceuticals from their aqueous solutions, such as atenolol (ATL), carbamazepine (CBZ), ciprofloxacin (CIP), diclofenac (DCF), gemfibrozil (GEM) and ibuprofen (IBP). Detailed batch tests were conducted to investigate the effects of adsorption time, initial EC concentration, PG dosage, solution pH, and temperature. Treatment efficiencies of ECs removal by PG were compared with those removed by carbonaceous counterparts (graphene oxide and graphite). Mixed solutions of these ECs were treated in different water bodies to test PG as a tertiary treatment option. The mechanism of adsorption was explored via thermodynamic studies, adsorption kinetics, and isotherm modelling, and characterisation of PG sorbent before and after ECs adsorption using TEM, SEM-EDS, XRD, FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy and other analyses. The results revealed fast kinetics and adsorption capacities exceeding 100 mg-EC/g-PG for some of ECs, and high removal efficiencies for trace concentrations of all selected ECs (> 99%) at a low dose of PG (100 mg/L). Removal efficiencies of mixed ECs in water and wastewater samples suffered from negative interferences, which can be mitigated by increasing the PG dosage. Adsorption processes were heterogeneous and controlled by physisorption. Further results showed the exothermic nature of the enthalpy-driven adsorption process and the recyclability potential of PG. It can be considered that PG could be used as a promising candidate for efficient treatment of water contaminated with ECs related to the pharmaceutical group.

AB The environmental safety of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) requires a crucial examination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of biomarkers of stress and toxicity in freshwater mussels to the effect of commonly found PPCPs in wastewater. We treated male mussels Unio tumidus, from an undisturbed site with ibuprofen (IBU, 250 ng L-1), triclosan (TCS, 500 ng L-1), or estrone (E1, 100 ng L-1) for 14 days. Untreated mussels from this site (C) and mussels inhabiting a polluted area (P) were also examined after a similar time of being kept in the laboratory. The consequences of chronic exposure of the mussels in the P-group were reflected in elevated concentrations of oxyradicals (1.4 times), oxidized glutathione (4.3 times), lipofuscin (2.2 times), and DNA-strand breaks in the digestive gland (DG) in comparison to the C-group, higher levels of caspase-3 activity in the DG, and vitellogenin-like proteins in gonads among all studied groups. Exposed mussels demonstrated some common responses with mussels in the P-group: elevated levels of lactate/pyruvate ratio, lipofuscin (IBU and E1), DNA fragmentation (TCS and E1), and caspase-3 activity (TCS and E1). Exposed to PPCPs mussels also showed elevation of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and/or glutathione-S-transferase activity in the DG and a decrease in lysosomal stability in hemocytes (TCS and E1). The TCS group was distinguished by having the highest level of DNA-fragmentation and the lowest concentrations of total glutathione, oxyradicals, lipofuscin, pyruvate, and lactate, reflecting total metabolic depression. These results show that selected PPCPs at low concentrations alter a variety of physiological processes in this animal model system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Alternative water sources for crop production need to be identified in order to meet increasing food demand under climate change scenario. However unconventional water source can contain micropollutants like endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals due to their persistence after the most common wastewater treatments. Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world's population which requires high volumes of water to achieve optimal yields. For this reason also low micropollutants concentration can represent a serious problem due to the stack in the trophic chain. At the state of art, the effects of these compounds on crops yield and quality remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, the aim of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine and ibuprofen on the growth of Oryza sativa (L.) and their presence in the grain. We also investigated the possible interactions of biofertilizer based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with the pollutants to evaluate if their use affected the grain pollutants content due to irrigation with polluted water. The results show that the polluted solution has caused an increase in rice yield (+51 %) and growth. The interaction between the polluting treatment and the mycorrhizal fungi has caused an increase in photochemical efficiency values compared to the control (+2.63 %). Instead, only with AMF treatment an inhibitory effect on the growth (-42 %) and photochemical efficiency (-5.4 %) have been observed. An ibuprofen (119.3 ng g(-1)) and caffeine (from 52 to 1060 ng g(-1)) translocation in rice grain has been observed. As far as we know, this is the first study reporting the presence of exogenous caffeine, and ibuprofen in rice grain suggesting further evaluations about the possible agronomical, environmental and human health risks effects of these pollutants.

AB BACKGROUND Phenols are compounds found in agricultural by-products, with high antioxidant activity and positive impact on human health. As a result, their isolation and purification is of interest for the production of cosmetics, nutritional and pharmaceutical supplements. A preliminary design for a plant with a treatment capacity of 1.1 m(3) h(-1) of liquid by-products or extracts is presented herein, based on experiments carried out with three materials rich in phenolic compounds. The proposed process for the separation of phenols implements physicochemical methods such as solvent extraction, filtration through membranes, adsorption/desorption on resins and vacuum evaporation. The materials tested were olive mill wastewater (OMW), grape marc and olive leaves. RESULTS The final products of the proposed process were rich in phenolic compounds, with the OMW final concentrate containing 378 g L-1 phenols in gallic acid equivalents, 84.8 g L-1 being hydroxytyrosol (61% of the initial amount of hydroxytyrosol was retrieved in the final concentrate in 0.05% of the initial OMW volume). The final concentrate of olive leaf extract contained 98 g L-1 phenols in gallic acid equivalents, and the final concentrate of grape marc phenols 190 g L-1 in gallic acid equivalents, containing 4.7 g L-1 catechin (25% of the initial amount of catechin was retrieved in the final concentrate in 0.04% of the initial extract volume). CONCLUSIONS The combination of the proposed techniques proved to be effective for the separation and purification of phenols contained in agro-industrial by-products. As a result, a new process was designed for their separation and purification. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The purpose of this work was to study the ozonation of nanofiltration (NF) retentates of real municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents for removal of microcontaminants (MCs) and toxicity. MCs present in these effluents were monitored using LC-MS/MS. Acute and chronic toxicity was addressed with Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and Selenastrum capricornutum. Up to 40 MCs were found, most of them in concentrations over 100 ng/L. 90% degradation of the sum of MCs was the critical point of comparison. When the NF membrane system was applied to MWTP effluents, treatment of NF rejection needed 2.75-4.5 g O-3/m(3),4.5 g O-3/m(3), which is less than 50% of the ozone needed for direct treatment of MWTP effluent. Treatment time (lower than 11 min) was not influenced by MCs concentration, at least in the range tested (25-190 mu g/L). It has been demonstrated that consumption of ozone increased with organic load and inorganic content of different real effluents. MCs were eliminated by ozonation but acute toxicity (against V. fischeri and D. magna) increased. Chronic toxicity results were different and contrary in D. magna and S. capricornutum, due to the generation of new transformation products more toxic to D. magna than the parent contaminants. S. capricornutum inhibition percentage decreased in all cases after ozonation treatment. According to these results, before ozonation is implemented in MWTPs for the removal of MCs, the transformation products must first be examined and the treatment time or ozone doses should be extended to complete degradation if necessary.

AB Municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) and its constituents, such as chemicals of emerging concern, pose a potential threat to the sustainability of fish populations by disrupting key endocrine functions in aquatic organisms. While studies have demonstrated changes in biological markers of exposure of aquatic organisms to groups of chemicals of emerging concern, the variability of these markers over time has not been sufficiently described in wild fish species. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of biological markers in response to MWWE exposure and to test the consistency of these responses between seasons and among years. Rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) were collected in spring and fall seasons over a 5-year period in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. In addition to surface water chemistry (nutrients and selected pharmaceuticals), measures were taken across levels of biological organization in rainbow darter. The measurements of hormone production, gonad development, and intersex severity were temporally consistent and suggested impaired reproduction in male fish collected downstream of MWWE outfalls. In contrast, ovarian development and hormone production in females appeared to be influenced more by urbanization than MWWE. Measures of gene expression and somatic indices were highly variable between sites and years, respectively, and were inconclusive in terms of the impacts of MWWE overall. Robust biomonitoring programs must consider these factors in both the design and interpretation of results, especially when spatial and temporal sampling of biological endpoints is limited. Assessing the effects of contaminants and other stressors on fish in watersheds would be greatly enhanced by an approach that considers natural variability in the endpoints being measured.

AB To examine the occurrence and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and inform future monitoring of CECs in coastal urban waterways, water, sediment, and fish tissue samples were collected and analyzed for a broad suite of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), commercial and/or household chemicals, current use pesticides, and hormones in an effluent-dominated river and multiple embayments in southern California (USA). In the Santa Clara River, which receives treated wastewater from several facilities, aqueous phase CECs were detectable at stations nearest discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants but were attenuated downstream. Sucralose and the chlorinated phosphate flame retardants tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were most abundant in water, with maximum concentrations of 35g/L, 3.3g/L, 1.4g/L, and 0.81g/L, respectively. Triclocarban, an antimicrobial agent in use for decades, was more prevalent in water than triclosan or nonylphenol. Maximum concentrations of bifenthrin, permethrin, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and degradates of fipronil exceeded CEC-specific monitoring trigger levels recently established for freshwater and estuarine sediments by factors of 10 to 1000, respectively. Maximum fish tissue concentrations of PBDEs varied widely (370ng/g and 7.0ng/g for the Santa Clara River and coastal embayments, respectively), with most species exhibiting concentrations at the lower end of this range. These results suggest that continued monitoring of pyrethroids, PBDEs, and degradates of fipronil in sediment is warranted in these systems. In contrast, aqueous pharmaceutical concentrations in the Santa Clara River were not close to exceeding current monitoring trigger levels, suggesting a lower priority for targeted monitoring in this medium.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which a suite of organic micropollutants (MPs) can be removed by biological filtration and the role of bioavailability and ammonia oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) in the biodegradation process. During approximately one year, laboratory-scale columns with 8 min empty bed contact time (EBCT) and packed with anthracite as filter media were used for treating a tertiary effluent spiked with a broad range of MPs at a target concentration of 2 mu g L-1. In parallel columns, aerobic biomass growth was inhibited by using either the biocide sodium azide (500 mg L-1 NaN3) or allylthiourea (5 mg L-1 ATU), specifically inhibiting nitrifying bacteria. Once the biomass had colonized the media, around 15% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOG) contained in the untreated tertiary effluent was removed by non-inhibited columns. The removal of several MPs increased over time indicating the relevance of biological activity for the removal of MPs, while the negative control, the NaN3 inhibited column, showed no significant removal. Out of 33 MPs, 19 were recalcitrant (<25%) to biodegradation under aerobic conditions with the others exhibiting a diverse range of removal efficiency up to 95%. Through inhibition by ATU it was shown that nitrifying bacteria were clearly having a role in the degradation of several MPs, whereas the removal of other MPs was not affected by the presence of the nitrification inhibitor. A relationship between the qualitative assessment of sorption of MPs on granular activated carbon (GAC) and their removal efficiency by biodegradation on anthracite was observed. This result suggested that the affinity of the MPs for GAG media could be a useful indicator of the bioavailability of compounds during biofiltration on anthracite. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions mediated by enzyme have been proposed as an effective remediation strategy to remove micropollutants, however, little is known about how the Mn(II) redox cycling affects the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated reactions in wastewater treatment. Here, we explored the removal of two pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), methylparaben (MeP) and acetaminophen (AAP), in HRP-mediated reaction system with dissolved Mn (II). It was found that the conversion rate of AAP was about 284 times higher than that of MeP, and Mn (II) significantly inhibited HRP-catalyzed MeP removal but had little influence on that of AAP. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical calculations demonstrated that HRP converted Mn(II) into Mn(III), and then generated MnO2 colloid, which inhibited the removal of the substrates. Moreover, the results of theoretical calculations also showed that the binding energy between HRP and Mn was 27.68 kcal/mol, which was higher than that of MeP (25.24 kcal/mol) and lower than that of AAP (30.19 kcal/mol). Therefore, when MeP and Mn (II) coexisted in the reaction system, HRP preferentially reacted with Mn(II), which explained the different impacts of Mn (II) on the removal of MeP and AAP. Additionally, Mn (II) significantly altered the product distribution by decreasing the amount of polymerization products. Overall, our work here revealed the roles of Mn (II) in the removal of MeP and AAP mediated by HRP, having strong implications for an accurate assessment of the influence of Mn(II) redox cycling on the removal of PPCPs in wastewater treatment.

AB The rejection of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is an important consideration for the application of forward osmosis (FO) in wastewater recycling. However, the transport of organic compounds in FO is not well predicted by existing models, partially because these models have not incorporated the effect of reverse salt flux, a phenomenon previously shown to influence the transport of pharmaceutical compounds. In this study, we investigated the effects of reverse salt flux on DBP transport in FO and the corresponding mechanisms. We used a commercial Aquaporin membrane and tested sixteen DBPs relevant to wastewater recycling. Using draw solutions constituted by NaCl, MgSO4, or glucose in a bench-scale FO system, we first confirmed that higher reverse salt flux resulted in lower DBP permeance. By integrating results from the bench-scale FO system and those from diffusion cell tests, we showed that two mechanisms contributed to the hindered DBP transport: the steric hindrance in the active layer caused by the presence of the draw solute and the retarded diffusion of DBPs in the support layer via a "salting-out" effect. Lastly, we developed a modified solution-diffusion model incorporating these two mechanisms by accounting for the free volume occupied by draw solute molecules in the active layer and by introducing the Setschenow constant, respectively. The modified model significantly improved the prediction of permeance for halogenated DBPs, and revealed the relative importance of steric hindrance (dominant for large DBPs) and retarded diffusion (dominant for hydrophobic DBPs). The modified model did not accurately predict the permeance of nitrosamines, attributable to their extremely high hydrophilicity or large size. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zero-valent scrap iron (ZVSI) combined with Fenton-based oxidation reaction (reduction-oxidation process) was studied under natural sunlight conditions to degrade a mixture of six pharmaceuticals. ZVSI is a waste product from metalworking industries, which present excellent reactivity. The morphological and structural properties of ZVSI were evaluated using different techniques. The parent compounds and their transformation products (TPs) were monitored using Liquid Chromatographic coupled with Quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometer (LCQTOF MS). The in silico (quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) predictions of toxicity and biodegradability were predicted for each TP by using different freely available models. According the characterization ZVSI consisted mainly of carbon (48.5 %) and iron (43.6 %) with 0.6922 m(2)/g of surface area. Hematite and magnetite were the main crystalline phases ZVSI. Doehlert design and desirability profile were used to select the experimental conditions. Higher degradation rates were achieved at pH 3.0, 32.5 mg L-1 H2O2 and 2 g L-1 ZVSI. Under the optimal conditions, pharmaceuticals removal was as high as 87 % in all matrixes evaluated, following a pseudo-first order kinetic model behavior. Three reuse cycles were performed using real hospital wastewater (RHWW) achieving degradation percentages > 70% and no substantial variation in the crystalline phases of the ZVSI was observed. Twenty-three TPs were detected. According to in silico (Q)SAR predictions, the integrated system decreased the toxicity of TPs. Moreover, most of TPs were predicted as persistent compounds. The results indicated that ZVSI combined with solar Fenton-based oxidation is an interesting alternative for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in RHWW allowing the reuse of catalyst.

AB Sub-Saharan urban centers have to tackle high population growth, lack of sanitation infrastructures and the need for good quality water resources. To characterize the impacts of anthropization on the water resources of the capital of Cameroon (Yaounde), a multi-disciplinary approach was used in ten sub-watersheds (peri-urban and urban) of the Mefou watershed. Pharmaceutical residues were used as tracers of surface and groundwater contamination caused by the release of domestic wastewater from pit latrines and landfills. A water use survey was conducted in the vicinity of the sampling sites to better assess water use, treatment and management. Available land use and hydro-geomorphological data completed characterization of the sub-watersheds. The combined data showed that natural features (elevation, slope, and hydrography) and human activities (land use) favor rainfall-runoff events and hence surface water contamination. Pharmaceutical monitoring revealed contamination of both surface and groundwater especially in the urban sub-watersheds. Analgesics/anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-epileptic carbamazepine were the most frequently found compounds (in up to 91% of water samples) with concentrations of acetaminophen reaching 5660 ng/L. In urban sub-watersheds, 50% of the groundwater sites used for drinking water were contaminated by diclofenac (476-518 ng/L), carbamazepine (263-335 ng/L), ibuprofen (141-276 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (<2-1285 ng/L) and acetaminophen (110-111 ng/L), emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the interactions between surface and groundwater. The use of groundwater as drinking water by 68% of the total population surveyed raises concerns about population exposure and potential health risks. This case study highlights the need for strategies to limit contamination of the water resource given the predicted future expansion of Sub-Saharan urban centers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases E.C. 3.1.1.3) are enzymes produced by mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria that catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols into glycerol and fatty acids. Lipases are versatile in lipid biotechnology due to their selective properties, which have been applied in recent years in emulsifiers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, flavors, fragrances, as well as for the pretreatment of lipid-rich wastewater, the bioremediation of oils and biodiesel synthesis. This review offers information collected over the last 10 years on lipase sources as well as advances in production, purification strategies and the main applications in industry.

AB Traditional wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove trace pharmaceutical and personal care products. In particular, quinolone antibiotics are mainly adsorbed on microbial cell surfaces in excess sludge and are released into the water environment during agricultural supplementation, mainly due to the exfoliation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) caused by changes in environmental conditions. Here, the occurrence of seven typical quinolone antibiotics from three generations in excess sludge was investigated at trace concentrations using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). EPS facilitated adsorption independent of pH and quinolone antibiotic type, and the solid-liquid distribution coefficient decreased markedly as pH increased (pH 5-9, range of municipal wastewater). Metal ions bound in EPS were predominantly responsible for the adsorption of antibiotics in sludge, rather than the macroscopic size of the sludge floc. pH affected patterns of quinolone antibiotics, the zeta potential of sludge floc, and the contents of metal ions contained in sludge. The adsorption capacity of antibiotics first increased and then decreased with increasing pH in the range of pH 3-11, reaching a maximum (20,506, 14,458, 10,689, 22,854, 20,302, 8494, and 29,547 L/kg for CIP, ENR, LOM, MOX, NOR, OFL, and SAR, respectively) near pH 5, at which the cationic bridging of Ca2+ and Mg2+ bound in EPS played a major role owing to their larger ion radius and higher contents in excess sludge. Due to high surface heterogeneity of sludge, the Freundlich model was more suitable than the Langmuir model for describing the adsorption behavior of quinolone antibiotics. These results provide further insight into the release of quinolone antibiotics adsorbed in excess sludge, with potential implications for the agricultural use of sludge.

AB In this study, the effects of five different pre-oxidation scenarios (i.e., individual, simultaneous, and sequential applications of chlorine dioxide [ClO2] and chlorine [Cl-2]) on the removal of N-nitro-sodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential (FP) from different water matrices (i.e., non-impacted natural waters, wastewater [WW]-impacted, and polymer-impacted waters) with subsequent chloramination were investigated. Practically relevant doses of ClO2 and Cl-2 were applied for all scenarios to avoid the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) at regulatory levels. The removal efficiency of NDMA FP for all the oxidation scenarios (individual or simultaneous) was <20% in non-impacted natural water samples. In 20% WW-impacted waters, pre-oxidation with ClO2 at pH 7.8 resulted in a significant reduction in NDMA FP (56-73%), whereas pre-oxidation with Cl-2 showed less removals (40-50%). For the integrated oxidation scenarios (i.e., simultaneous or sequential application), NDMA FP removals further increased (20-45%), especially, at pH 6.0 compared to individual application of oxidants in WW -impacted waters. The formation of NDMA in pre-oxidized water samples also decreased significantly under uniform formation condition (UFC). In polymer-impacted waters, integrated applications of Cl-2 and ClO2 significantly improved the deactivation of polymer-derived NDMA precursors independent of oxidation time (10 vs. 60 min) and pH (6.0 vs. 7.8) compared to individual application of these oxidants. In addition, chlorite (ClO2-) formation was low and maintained well below 1 mg/L for integrated applications of Cl-2 and ClO2, while chlorate (ClO3-) formation increased significantly as compared to application of ClO2 only.

AB The assessment of vulnerability in karst systems reveals to be extremely challenging since it varies significantly with time and highly depends on the identification of diffuse and concentrated infiltration from surface karst features. The origin, consumed loads, and transport mode of selected micropollutants (MPs) including two artificial sweeteners (ASWs) Sucralose (SUC) and Acesulfame-K (ACE-K), in addition to other less investigated pharmaceuticals such as the lipid regulator Gemfibrozil (GEM), and the contrast media Iohexol (IOX) were investigated in a karst system under dynamic conditions. A detailed analysis of selected spring responses' chemograph and hydrograph following a multi precipitation event shows that three of the tracked MPs, especially ACE-K, and to the exception of IOX, can be used as specific indicators for point source domestic wastewater in karst systems. They have revealed to be persistent, source specific, conservative, and highly correlated with in situ parameters easily measurable at the spring (chloride and turbidity). Even if the selected MPs are found in the system during low flow periods, they are mostly transported to the spring through fast flow pathways from flushed wastewater with surface water or flood rainwater. The highest mass inflow of ACE-K, IOX and GEM originated from a sinking stream, while SUC infiltrated exclusively through fast infiltration points (dolines). Their breakthrough curves coincide with the arrival of new waters and turbidity peaks. Unlike IOX, the mass fluxes of ASWs, and GEM to a lesser extent, can be linearly correlated with chloride mass fluxes and turbidity flux. Moreover, the variance of the normalized breakthrough curves of the MPs with respect to a mean transit time, increases in that order IOX < GEM < Turbidity < SUC < ACE-K indicating a higher restitution time for ACE-K with respect to other spring signals.

AB In this study, a saline effluent from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor was treated by nanofiltration in order to allow its agricultural reuse. Short-term tests were conducted to investigate membrane fouling and selective rejection of ions and emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). The study has been conducted with a negatively charged commercial thin-film composite membrane (DK, GE Osmonics). The effect of operating pressure (5-20 bar) and cross-flow velocity (0.12-0.37 m/s) on membrane performance have been researched. Dimensional analysis of steady permeate flux indicated that the gel layer or the polarization layer can be completely removed at critical cross-flow velocity. At a sub-critical velocity, membrane autopsies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy revealed a complex mixture of organic matter, phosphates and colloidal silica over the membranes surface. Since the rejection of monovalent cations (76-88%) was lower than that of multivalent cations (above 96%), the treated effluent was characterized by a very high levels of sodium adsorption ratio and ammonium. In addition, moderate rejection of low molecular weight EOCs (clofibric acid and caffeine) was observed. Therefore, the treated effluent did not achieve enough quality to be reused for agricultural irrigation. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical EngineersEnviron Prog, 37: 383-390, 2018
   During the last decade, interest in the application of nanofiltration in wastewater treatment has grown in response to stringent water quality standards and increasing concern about the presence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). Nevertheless, information remains scarce about membrane fouling and EOCs rejection. The current research addresses these issues during its application to a brackish effluent from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor to be reused for agricultural irrigation. Dimensional analysis has allowed establishing the optimum operation conditions in terms fouling control. As regard of EOCs rejection, low molecular weight compounds were not completely retained by the membrane.

AB Amoxicillin (AMX) is a widespread beta-lactam-antibiotic and, together with some of its transformation products (TPs) originating from hydrolysis, a known environmental contaminant. To shed light on the abiotic degradation of AMX and the stability of its known TPs, laboratory hydrolysis experiments of AMX were carried out at pH 3, 7 and 11. Not only the rate of hydrolysis but also the pattern of TPs was strongly pH-dependent. The time courses of the obtained transformation products were analyzed by UPLC-HR-QToF-MS. AMX penicilloic acid (TP 1), AMX 2',5'-diketopiperazine (TP 2), AMX penilloic acid (TP 3) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazinol (TP 4) were found at neutral pH. Surprisingly, the first three were not stable but transformed into 23 yet unknown TPs within three to four weeks. Seven TPs were tentatively identified, based on their product ion spectra and, where possible, confirmed with reference standards, e.g. penicillamine disulfide, 2-[amino(carboxy)methyl]-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and dehydrocarboxylated amoxicillin penilloic acid. Analysis of samples from municipal wastewater treatment plants confirmed these findings with TP 1 being the dominant TP in the influent and a shift towards TP 2, TP 3 and TP 4 in the effluents. The lab experiments predicted up to 13 consecutive TPs from TP 1, TP 2 and TP 3 under neutral conditions. Their detection from surface waters will be difficult, because their large number and slow formation kinetics will lead to comparatively low environmental concentrations. Nevertheless the abiotic degradation of TP 1, TP 2 and TP 3 to further TPs needs to be considered in future studies of the environmental fate of amoxicillin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The influence of uncertainties in biokinetic parameters for ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria on the performance of a two-step nitrification model was evaluated using the Generalized Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique. The predictive capability of behavioral simulations generated using GLUE was assessed utilizing data from experiments comparing nitrification in the presence and absence of two pharmaceuticals - atenolol or sotalol. Results suggest that GLUE cannot account for model structural error arising when ammonia oxidation is competitively inhibited. Use of a competitive inhibition model for ammonia oxidation (i.e., correction of the model structural error), however, enables GLUE to generate meaningful uncertainty intervals. While GLUE is used in the present study, other uncertainty analysis techniques are likely to be similarly unable to account for model structural errors. Thus, results from this study emphasize the importance of model selection for efficacious uncertainty analysis. The behavioral simulations generated using GLUE based on application of the correct model was subsequently used to evaluate the sensitivity of transformation coefficients employed to describe the cometabolism of atenolol by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Sensitivity was assessed by computing nonparametric elasticities of the cometabolism transformation coefficients to biokinetic parameters selected to describe nitrification in a novel application of a generalized nonparametric analysis. Results suggest that the AOB-growth related transformation coefficient of atenolol is relatively insensitive to variation in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing biokinetic parameters. In contrast, the non-growth related transformation coefficient describing atenolol cometabolism appears to be sensitive to the specific growth rate of AOB. Elasticities are used to assess whether estimates of atenolol-AOB cometabolic biodegradation coefficients from lab-scale experiments could be used more generally. This novel application of elasticities to biological wastewater process modeling suggests that seasonal temperature variations may be an important factor in pharmaceutical biodegradation during biological wastewater treatment.

AB Background The presence of a wide range of bioactive organic pollutants in wastewater and municipal water sources is raising concerns about their potential effects on humans. Not surprisingly, various approaches are being explored that can efficiently degrade these persistent organic pollutants. Use of peroxidases has recently been recognized as a novel remediation approach that may have potential advantages over conventional degradation techniques. However, testing the abilities of different peroxidases to degrade diverse emerging pollutants is tedious and cumbersome. Results In the present study, we present a rapid and robust approach to easily test the degradability of 21 different emerging pollutants by five different peroxidases (soybean peroxidase, chloroperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, manganese peroxidase, and horseradish peroxidase) using an LC-MSMS approach. Furthermore, this approach was also used to examine the role of a redox mediator in these enzymatic degradation assays. Our results show that some of the organic pollutants can be easily degraded by all five of the peroxidases tested, whereas others are only degraded by a specific peroxidase (or when a redox mediator was present) and there are some that are completely resistant to degradation by any of the peroxidases tested (even in the presence of a redox mediator). The degradation of furosemide and trimethoprim by soybean peroxidase and chloroperoxidase, respectively, was investigated in detail by examining the transformation products generated during their degradation. Some of the products generated during enzymatic breakdown of these pollutants have been previously reported by others, however, we report many new transformation products. Conclusions LC-MSMS approaches, like the one described here, can be used to rapidly evaluate the potential of different peroxidases (and redox requirements) to be used as bioremediation agents. Our preliminary result shows peroxidases hold tremendous potential for being used in a final wastewater treatment step.

AB Vancomycin is one of the most commonly used glycopeptide antiobiotics, and as such is an important emerging environmental contaminant. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), such as antibiotics, are problematic since wastewater treatment processes are not completely effective at removing these chemical compounds. Since wastewater treatment processes are not completely effective, vancomycin occurs in surface water. Vancomycin and its metabolites in vivo and degradation products in aquatic environment may lead to undesirable ecological effects that threaten the environment or cause undesirable reactions that affect human health. We aimed to study vancomycin metabolism in vitro and its natural degradation in aquatic environment, as well as explore for related metabolites and degradation products. Accordingly, we established four systems, using a constant temperature oscillator at 37 degrees C for 10 days for vancomycin in activated rat liver microsomes (experimental system), inactivated rat liver microsomes (control system), phosphate buffer saline (PBS system) and pure water (pure water system), as well as an additional system of activated rat liver microsomes without vancomycin (blank system). The metabolism and degradation of vancomycin were studied using a high resolution and high sensitivity ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Triple-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (MS) method in positive ion mode. The compared result of activated rat liver microsomes system and inactivated rat liver microsomes system confirms that vancomycin is not metabolized in the liver. Vancomycin was degraded in the four nonblank incubation systems. The MetabolitePilot 2.0 software was used for screening the probable degradation products, as well as for establishing its associated degradation pathways. Eventually, four degradation products were identified and their chemical structures were deduced. The results of this study provide a foundation for evaluation of the effects of vancomycin and its degradation products on environmental safety and human health in the future.

AB Surface water contamination with current-use pesticides (CUPS) is usually associated with inputs from agriculture. However, there are several urban sources of these compounds, including pesticides used in public spaces, golf courses, and lawns and gardens; discharges of municipal wastewater containing fungicides from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs); and runoff of biocides that are used in construction materials. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used to monitor the occurrence of fungicides and selected herbicides in surface waters in the densely populated urban area near Toronto, Canada. Samplers were deployed in five urban streams, one agriculturally dominated stream, and at five locations in the nearshore zone of western Lake Ontario adjacent to urban areas. Sampling rates for target compounds in POCIS determined in laboratory calibration experiments ranged between 0.03 and 0.65 L/day. For herbicides, atrazine was detected at all sites, and diuron, 2,4-D, and mecoprop were frequently detected. The fungicides carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl were detected at all sites, and a hydroxy-metabolite of the fungicide chlorothalonil was also widely detected. Fungicides used in PPCPs (e.g. fluconazole, climbazole) were primarily detected in POCIS deployed in locations impacted by municipal wastewater. Estimated time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of iprodione and carbendazim in urban streams were consistent with the number of golf courses in the watershed. However, runoff of biocides from building materials may also be a source of these fungicides. Overall, these data indicate that urban environments, as indicated by the Toronto area, have several point and non-point sources of fungicides and other CUPs.

To gain a deeper understanding of the fate of thereby introduced organic micropollutants, the attenuation of 28 compounds was investigated in column experiments using two large scale column systems in duplicate. The influence of increasing proportions of solid organic matter (0.04% vs. 0.17%) and decreasing redox potentials (denitrification vs. iron reduction) was studied by introducing a layer of compost. Secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as water matrix for simulating soil aquifer treatment. For neutral and anionic compounds, sorption generally increases with the compound hydrophobicity and the solid organic matter in the column system. Organic cations showed the highest attenuation. Among them, breakthroughs were only registered for the cationic beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol. An enhanced degradation in the columns with organic infiltration layer was observed for the majority of the compounds, suggesting an improved degradation for higher levels of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. Solely the degradation of sulfamethoxazole could clearly be attributed to redox effects (when reaching iron reducing conditions). The study provides valuable insights into the attenuation potential for a wide spectrum of organic micropollutants under realistic soil aquifer treatment conditions. Furthermore, the introduction of the compost layer generally showed positive effects on the removal of compounds preferentially degraded under reducing conditions and also increases the residence times in the soil aquifer treatment system via sorption.

AB Use of animal manure is a main source of veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) in soil and groundwater through a series of migration processes. The sorption-desorption and transport of four commonly used VPs including trimethoprim (TMP), sulfapyridine, sulfameter, and sulfadimethoxine were investigated in three soil layers taken from an agricultural field in Chongming Island China and two types of aqueous solution (0.01 M CaCl2 solution and wastewater treatment plant effluent). Results from sorption-desorption experiments showed that the sorption behavior of selected VPs conformed to the Freundlich isotherm equation. TMP exhibited higher distribution coefficients (K (d) = 6.73-9.21) than other sulfonamides (K (d) = 0.03-0.47), indicating a much stronger adsorption capacity of TMP. The percentage of desorption for TMP in a range of 8-12 % is not so high to be considered significant. Low pH (< pK (a) of tested VPs) and rich soil organic matter (e.g., 0-20 cm soil sample) had a positive impact on sorption of VPs. Slightly lower distribution coefficients were obtained for VPs in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, which suggested that dissolved organic matter might affect their sorption behavior. Column studies indicated that the transport of VPs in the soil column was mainly influenced by sorption capacity. The weakly adsorbed sulfonamides had a high recovery rate (63.6-98.0 %) in the leachate, while the recovery rate of TMP was only 4.2-10.4 %. The sulfonamides and TMP exhibited stronger retaining capacity in 20-80 cm and 0-20 cm soil samples, respectively. The transport of VPs was slightly higher in the columns leached by WWTP effluent than by CaCl2 solution (0.01 M) due to their sorption interactions.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are widely distributed in urban wastewaters and can be removed to some extent by constructed wetlands (CWs). The medium-term (3-5 years) behaviour of these systems regarding PPCP removal is still unknown. Seven mesocosm-scale (1 m(2)) CWs of different configurations were operated outdoors for 39 months under the same conditions to assess their PPCP removal ability and temporal evolution. CWs differed in some design parameters, namely plant presence, species chosen (Typha angustifolia vs Phragmites australis), flow configuration and presence/absence of gravel bed (floating macrophytes surface flow, FM-SF; free-water surface flow, FW-SF; free-water subsurface flow, FW-SSF; or conventional horizontal subsurface flow, SSF). PPCP efficiencies decreased throughout time and performance differences among CWs disappeared with the systems aging. This could be due to a homogenization process in the systems caused by detrimental factors like saturation, clogging and shading. Winter efficiencies were lower than summer ones for salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide, and seasonal biological activities seem key factors to explain this fact. Maximal removal efficiencies were achieved in an unplanted-FW-SSF for ketoprofen (47-81%), naproxen (58-81%) and salicylic acid (76-98%); in an unplanted-SSF for caffeine (65-99%); in a Phragmites-FM-SF for ibuprofen (49-96%) and diclofenac (16-68%); in a Typha-FM-SF for carbamazepine (35-71%); and in a Typha-FW-SSF for methyl dihydrojasmonate (71-96%), galaxolide (67-82%) and tonalide (55-74%). Photodegradation could be involved in ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac removal. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were moderately removed by the most efficient CWs studied. Carbamazepine might be eliminated by vegetal uptake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX)-a member of the sulfonamide antibacterial class-has been frequently detected in municipal wastewater and surface water bodies in recent years. Kinetics, mechanisms, and products of SMX in reactions with free chlorine (HOCl/OCl-) were studied in detail to evaluate the effect of chlorination processes on the fate of sulfonamides in municipal wastewaters and affected drinking waters. Direct reactions of free available chlorine (FAC) with SMX were quite rapid. A half-life of 23 s was measured under pseudo-first-order conditions ([FAC](0) = 20 AM (1.4 mg/L) and [SMX](0) = 2 muM) at pH 7 and 25 degreesC in buffered reagent water. In contrast, a half-life of 38 h was determined for reactions with combined chlorine (NH2Cl, NHCl2) under similar conditions. Free chlorine reaction rates were first-order in both substrate and oxidant, with specific second-order rate constants of 1.1 x 10(3) and 2.4 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) for SMX neutral and anionic species, respectively. Investigations with substructure model compounds and identification of reaction products verified that chlorine directly attacks the SMX aniline-nitrogen, resulting in (i) halogenation of the SIVIX aniline moiety to yield a ring-chlorinated product at sub-stoichiometric FAC concentrations (i.e., [FAC](0):[SMX](0) less than or equal to 1) or (ii) rupture of the SMX sulfonamide moiety in the presence of stoichiometric excess of FAC to yield 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, SO42- (via SO2), and N-chloro-p-benzoquinoneimine. Reaction ii represents an unexpected aromatic amine chlorination mechanism that has not previously been evaluated in great detail. Experiments conducted in wastewater and drinking water matrixes appeared to validate measured reaction kinetics for SMX, indicating that SMX and likely other sulfonamide antibacterials should generally undergo substantial transformation during disinfection of such waters with free chlorine residuals.

AB Eight compounds from three categories of pharmaceuticals [5 antibiotics, 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 1 anti-epileptics] were monitored at 24 sites in the tributaries of the Han River watershed in South Korea, 2016. The seasonal occurrence, temporal-spatial variation, potential compound source(s), and a risk assessment of this watershed, which is the largest drinking water source in the country, were investigated. Clarithromycin was detected most frequently (72.2%) with the greatest median concentration (0.151 +/- 0.072 lag L-1), followed by carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole. The seasonality of the pharmaceuticals was observed, with higher concentrations and detection frequencies in spring than in summer and autumn; this was possibly caused by lower levels of microbial activities associated with lower water temperatures than other seasons. In terms of geographical variation, urban areas had higher pharmaceutical concentrations than rural areas, which was attributed to the former's high population density and largest wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) regardless of season. The total concentration and detection frequency of WWTPs were 12.4 and 2.5 times higher in downstream sites than upstream sites, thereby conveying that WWTPs were the main source for the presence of pharmaceuticals in tributaries. According to the results produced from calculations of the risk quotient (RQ) of aquatic organisms, clarithromycin and sulfamethazine were identified as posing relatively high ecological risk (RQ > 1) during the spring that was identified for this study. This study can provide policymakers with scientific support for prioritizing pollutant management and collections of global data on emerging pollutants. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds, EDCs, are somewhat recently recognized pollutants which are often classed within 'emerging micropollutants' in the environment jargon. These compounds are known to interfere with the delicate balance of the endocrine system of animals and man, causing variety of undesirable outcomes. Their sources in natural waters are the domestic and industrial effluents. The main cause of concern with EDCs is their tendency to accumulate in fish causing gender shifts and reduced fecundity. Moreover, their possible interference with the water cycle and concurrent effects on the human endocrine system has been implicated. Increased usage of medication and surfactants in the household; pesticides in agriculture have all add up to the inventory of EDCs in the aqueous systems.
   Current view in combating EDCs in water cycle is the multi barrier approach. In this concept EDCs are tried to be controlled in effluents as well as in potable drinking waters. Therefore, knowledge on their elimination in classical wastewater treatment plants is vital for establishing sustainable strategies for the future.
   Five different EDCs were selected as model compounds in this study; two natural hormones, estrone and progesterone, which are constantly discharged by humans; carbamazepine, diltiazem and acetaminophen are pharmaceuticals which are widely used by the community. The 24 h composite samples were analyzed in influents and effluents of 7 full scale biological treatment plants of various modifications of activated sludge process, including one MBR plant. One striking finding was the removals obtained in conventional plants, which were far exceeding those obtained in the mid-scale or lab-scale MBR plants. Carbamazepine and diltiazem, two hydrophobic compounds, were found to sorb onto CAS sludge whereas not onto the MBR sludge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ozone-reactive electrochemical membrane (O-3-REM) coupled process for tetracycline (TC) removal was developed by coupling ozonation and electrochemical oxidation in a substoichiometric titanium dioxide (Ti4O7) REM reactor. To achieve concurrent and efficient degradation-mineralization, TC was treated by ozonation and electrochemical oxidation over the Ti4O7 REM anode in a sequent manner. TC was nearly completely removed within 20 min, while the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency attained 9.1% in 20 min, and then reached 77.1% in 80 min under optimal conditions of 2 mg/min ozone dosage and 2 mA/cm(2) current density. TC was suspected to be oxidized into some four- and three-ring intermediates within 20 min, some two- and one-ring intermediates within 80 min, and eventually carboxylic acids, CO2 and H2O. The concentrations of NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ increased slightly in the first 20 min and then elevated significantly from 20 to 80 min, indicating an enhanced denitrification rate via electrochemical oxidation. Besides, the bioluminescence inhibition ratio exhibited a slight decrease from 54.5% to 50.6% in the first 20 min and then significantly decreased to 14.5% in 80 min, suggesting an augmented toxicity reduction simultaneously by the coupled technology. Overall, the O-3-REM coupled process demonstrated higher TC degradation and TOC removal efficiencies, enhanced toxicity-reduction capability, and lower energy consumption for TC removal compared to individual O-3 or Ti4O7 REM processes. By comprehensively analyzing the performance, mechanism and energy consumption of TC removal by the O-3-REM coupled process, our research provides insights into the application potential of the coupled process to efficiently eliminate the amount and toxicity of various pharmaceuticals from wastewater.

AB Parabens (esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid) are xenobiosis belonging to endocrine disruptors and commonly used as a preservative in cosmetics, food, pharmaceutical, and personal care products. Their wide use is leading to their appearance in water and wastewater in the range from ng/L to mg/L. In fact, the toxicity of benzylparaben is comparable to bisphenol A. Therefore, it is important to find not only effective but also ecofriendly methods for their removal from aqueous environment since the traditional wastewater treatment approaches are ineffective. Herein, for the first time, such extended comparison of several radical-driven technologies for paraben mixture degradation is presented. The detailed evaluation included (1) comparison of ozone and hydroxyl peroxide processes; (2) comparison of catalytic and photocatalytic processes (including photocatalytic ozonation); (3) characterisation of catalysts using SEM, XRD, DRS, XPS techniques and BET isotherm; (4) mineralisation, biodegradability and toxicity assessment; and (5) cost assessment. O-3, H2O2/Fe2+, H2O2/UVC, O-3/H2O2, O-3/UVA, O-3/H2O2/UVA, UVA/catalyst, O-3/catalyst and O-3/UVA/catalyst were selected from advanced oxidation processes to degrade parabens as well as to decrease its toxicity towards Aliivibrio fischeri, Corbicula fluminea and Lepidium sativum. Research was focused on the photocatalytic process involving visible light (UVA and natural sunlight) and TiO2 catalysts modified by different metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic oxidation showed the lowest efficiency, while in combining ozone with catalysis and photocatalysis process, degradation efficiency and toxicity removal were improved. Photocatalytic ozonation slightly improved degradation efficiency but appreciably decreased transferred ozone dose (TOD). Results indicate that the degradation pathway is different, or different transformation products (TPs) could be formed, despite that the hydroxyl radicals are the main oxidant.

AB Antibiotic pollution is frequently detected in fresh waters and wastewaters where they represent an environmental risk for the development of global antibiotic resistance. Due to their excessive use in personal care products, UV filters have also been found to be pseudo-persistent in the aquatic environment. In contrast to antibiotics, which can undergo photodegradation, UV filters are compounds designed to stably absorb UV radiation. This study explored the light based remediation of representative antibiotics from seven classes of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolide, glycolpeptide, sulphonamides and trimethoprim) in order to assess whether antibiotic pollution persists longer in the presence of organic UV filters. We show that the presence of UV filters either completely supresses or significantly alters the photodegradation of antibiotics in water. Advanced technologies in wastewater treatment, such as the use of UV C radiation, both effectively minimise the effect of UV filters and degrade most of the tested antibiotics proving to be effective management strategy. However, the half-life of erythromycin and amoxicillin, widely used antibiotics from macrolide- and penicillin-like classes, is extended in the presence of UV filters, even during UV C irradiation. Overall, the UV filters present within environmental mixtures are identified as important drivers of mixture toxicity, as they prolong antibiotic contamination of aquatic and engineered environments. The ramification of such finding is that inadequate consideration of UV filters may result in an imperfect prediction of the solar and UV light-based remediation of antibiotics, lead to improper classification of antibiotics persistence in the environment and cause non-optimal chemical fate and transport model performance. Use of the more benign compounds and assessment of the UV filters were identified as feasible management options in minimizing the influence of UV filters onto the remediation of antibiotics in aquatic environments.

ID ANTIDEPRESSANT VENLAFAXINE; PHARMACEUTICALS; SURFACE
AB Widespread presence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment of industrialized countries is an emerging global concern. Potential contamination of the soil and water by such pharmacologically active substances poses serious ecotoxicological implications. Several studies assessing the long-term ecological risks of pharmaceutical contaminants mainly focus on the risk assessment of the parent drug, while the potential contributions of their metabolites is often neglected. Presence of selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, an antidepressant drug, and its metabolites is a matter of serious concern for aquatic systems, since they are difficult to remove by traditional wastewater treatment processes. The concentration of VEN present in water is reportedly one of the highest among pharmaceuticals; however, the long-term effects of its metabolites have not yet been systematically studied. Given the consideration to complex and time-consuming effluent treatment, and realizing the importance of levels of venlafaxine and its metabolites, a simple and accurate analytical method for quick determination is needed. We designed a selective colorimetric method by using oxidative coupling of drug molecules with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) reagent, to quantify the presence of venlafaxine and its metabolites in aquatic samples, with special emphasis on effluent. The method was validated for selectivity, specificity and robustness as per the ICH Q2 guidelines to assess its suitability in pharmaceutical samples, as well. Highly sensitive and green economical analytical method was successfully established for estimation of venlafaxine and its metabolites in aquatic samples. The method was quick, as it involved minimum processing steps. The method was accurate and linear in the range of 0.5 to 80 ppm and could successfully detect lowest concentration of 1.3 ppm, thus qualifying its applicability for the desired purpose to check the presence of trace levels of VEN or its metabolites in aquatic samples or in pharmaceutical formulations.

AB BACKGROUND Stevensite and biochar were investigated to covalently immobilize laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (MtL) and Pleurotus eryngii (PeL) through the sequential application of aminopropyltriethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. The immobilized preparations were tested to remove three tetracyclines and six sulfonamides at 0.1 mmol L-1 of each antibiotic. Degradation experiments were conducted both in the absence and in the presence (0.2 mmol L-1) of ABTS, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol (HBT), syringaldehyde or violuric acid. The residual antibiotic activity was tested towards five bacterial species and a bacterial consortium from wastewater. RESULTS Higher values of activity yields (74% and 70.3%) and catalytic capabilities (1426 and 1405 IU g(-1)) were obtained with PeL on stevensite and biochar than with MtL. Stevensite enabled higher reusability and storage stability than biochar. Best removals of tetracyclines and sulfonamides were obtained with immobilized-laccase systems coupled to ABTS or syringaldehyde. Immobilized-laccase/ABTS systems removed 100% of tetracyclines while only chlortetracycline was completely removed in the presence of syringaldehyde. With ABTS, the most effectively removed sulfonamides were sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine (up to 100% and 54%), while syringaldehyde best supported the removal of sulfanilamide, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole (up to 42%, 45% and 46%, respectively). In some cases, an effective antibiotics removal led to either low or no residual antibiotic activity.
   CONCLUSION MtL and PeL were immobilized successfully on biochar and stevensite. The addition of either ABTS or syringaldehyde enhanced significant removals, up to 100%, of tetracyclines and sulfonamides by the immobilized laccase systems. Noteworthy, biochar-immobilized laccases/ABTS led to complete suppression of the antibiotic activity of tetracyclines. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Occurrence, distribution, spatial and seasonal variations, and partitioning between aqueous phase and suspended particulate matters (SPM) of triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) in Xiaoqing River, which receives wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, were studied. The distribution of the total TCC and TCS levels in surface water and sediments along the river were discussed. The highest TCC and TCS concentrations were both found near the discharge port of WWTPs, and the TCC and TCS levels decreased downstream of the WWTPs as a result of their distances from the source of WWTP discharges. The mean values of TCC and TCS in low-flow season were 1.62 and 1.80 times, respectively, as much as in high-flow season in surface water. The study on partitioning of TCC and TCS between aqueous phase and SPM shown the mean level of dissolved TCC accounted for about 10 % of the total level in surface water, whereas the TCS level was about 30 %. The TCC concentrations detected in the surface sediment samples (0 to 5 cm) ranged from 226 to 1,956 ng/g, with a mean value of 733 ng/g. The TCS levels were between 85 and 705 ng/g, with a mean value of 255 ng/g. The distribution and variations of TCC and TCS in sediments along the river were highly consistent with those in the water phase. The TCC and TCS levels in deep sediments (5 to 10 cm) were significantly lower than those in surface sediments. The mean TCC level in surface sediments was about 2.4 times as much as in deep sediments, and the TCS level in surface sediments was 3.1 times as much as in deep sediments.

AB The results of the use of an expert system (ES) to control a novel multi-stage loop membrane bioreactor (MLMBR) for the simultaneous removal of organic substances and nutrients are reported. The study was conducted at a bench-scale plant for the purpose of meeting new discharge standards (GB21904-2008) for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater (1200-9600 mg/L COD, 500-2500 mg/L BOD5, 50-200 mg/L NH4+-LN and 105-400 mg/L TN in the influent water) by developing a distributed control system. The system allows various expert operational approaches to be deployed with the goal of minimizing organic substances and nitrogen levels in the outlet while using the minimum amount of energy. The proposed distributed control system, which is supervised by a Knowledge-Based Expert System (KBES) constructed with G2 (a tool for expert system development) and a back propagation BP artificial neural network, permits the on-line implementation of every operating strategy of the experimental system. A support vector machine (SVM) is applied to achieve pattern recognition. A set of experiments involving variable sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) was carried out. Using the proposed system, the amounts of COD, TN and NH4+-N in the effluent decreased by 55%, 62% and 38%, respectively, compared to the usual operating conditions. These improvements were achieved with little energy cost because the performance of the treatment plant was optimized using operating rules implemented in real time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The advent of global warming has given rise to the issue on how temperature impacts the susceptibility of ectothermic organisms to pollution. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pharmaceutical products and domestic wastewaters on temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity in the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mitochondria from mussels were freshly prepared and exposed to increasing concentrations of various pharmaceutical products known to be found in municipal effluents for 30 min at 4, 12 and 20 degrees C. Electron transport activity as well as lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks were determined in the mitochondria. Next, mussels were placed in the aeration lagoons of two municipal wastewater treatment plants for 30 days. Mitochondrial electron transport (MET), temperature-dependent MET (METT) and lipid peroxidation in gonad were then determined. The results show that all products were able to increase MET activity, but at two different ranges of threshold concentration. Certain pharmaceutical products (i.e., ibuprofen, cotinine, fluoxetine, coprostanol and trimethoprim) increased METT at a lower threshold concentration than observed at 20 degrees C. Products of lesser potency in reducing lipid peroxidation were those that produced more DNA strand breaks in mitochondria., Both MET and METT were significantly increased in mussels exposed to aeration lagoon effluents. Lipid peroxidation was also increased in the gonad and was! significantly correlated with MET and METT activities. The data indicate that pharmaceutical products and municipal effluents increase respiration rates in isolated mitochondria, such that interaction with temperature could enhance the susceptibility of mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress in environments contaminated by domestic wastewater.

AB Three organic fertilizers (EDTA (Ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid), EDDS (Ethylenediamine-N, N '-disuccinic acid) and DTPA (Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)) were tested as Fe-complexes in photo-Fenton process at natural pH for micropollutants (MPs) abatement and simultaneous E.coli inactivation. Less stable Fe complexes show high iron precipitation, stopping MPs degradation. On the contrary, stable Fe-complexes imply low kinetic rates for MPs removal. To solve these inconveniences, three mixtures of organic fertilizers were also tested, trying to improve the kinetic rates of micropollutants oxidation and overcome iron precipitation. Three different pollutants (propranolol (PROP), acetamiprid (ACMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)) were used as the target compounds. As the iron release is, in part, linked to the hardness of water, two water matrices from two different secondary wastewaters (Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) and Conventional Activated Sludge (CAS)) were tested. The best performance in micropollutant degradation and E.coli inactivation was achieved with the combination of EDDS + EDTA, accomplishing a good equilibrium between iron precipitation and rate of MPs removal. For instance, total removal of propranolol was achieved at 45 min in MBR, while it was only 85.7% in CAS, being an improvement of the process comparing with that obtained using single organic fertilizers. At the end of the treatment, 2.1 log-inactivation for E.coli was reached in CAS. The differences observed between both wastewaters were related to CAS' higher DOC, turbidity, and hardness. Finally, from the physicochemical characterization conducted, including Biochemical Oxygen Demand at 5 days and phytotoxicity, it is possible to highlight the suitability of these treated effluents for its reuse in irrigation, as long as in CAS matrix the final values of E. coli are within the legal limit.

AB The use of livestock waste for the production of biogas and the application of biogas slurry to agricultural soil can resolve livestock waste problems and reduce synthetic fertiliser use. However, the migration of veterinary drugs to land and crops resulting from biogas slurry irrigation is a potential food safety concern. This study employed an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time of flight high-resolution mass spectrometry system for wide-scope suspect screening of pharmaceutically active substances on crop cultivated under biogas slurry irrigation. Briefly, a total of 22 pak choi samples were obtained from a greenhouse farmed in tropical south Taiwan between March 2019 and March 2020. Molecular spectra and fragmented ions (between m/z 70 and 1100) were acquired. Ion features were searched and matched with a library consisting of 1068 compounds. The matrixes in the crop production environment including soil, livestock wastewater, biogas slurry, and groundwater were included in this study to elucidate potential sources of the pharmaceutically active substances. Results demonstrated 23 suspects were matched with high mass accuracy (mass error within +/- 5.0 ppm) in pak choi. The detection of both bufexamac and nandrolone were confirmed using standards, where a new system of identification points was applied. Nandrolone was detected throughout the pak choi samples as well as livestock wastewater. Tetracycline, macrolide, and sulfonamide antibiotics were presented in biogas slurry and soil but not pak choi. This is the first study to reveal the presence of multiclass pharmaceutically active substances in a crop supplied as food. Such findings suggest that anabolics and antibiotics should be closely monitored in the corps irrigated by biogas slurry in future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cytostatics are highly toxic pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of cancer. These substances are partially excreted by the human body after administration. The inefficient removal of some cytostatics in urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) allows them to reach surface waters and consequently the aquatic biota. However, information about their occurrence in urban wastewaters is available only for certain active ingredients. A liquid-liquid extraction method coupled to liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was developed, allowing the identification and quantification of 14 cytostatics in wastewater samples, avoiding the use of expensive sorbents. Moreover, satisfactory cytostatics' recoveries were achieved when the new method was applied to wastewaters from a Portuguese WWTP: average of (74 +/- 21)% for the influents, (83 +/- 22)% for secondary effluents, and (94 +/- 24)% for tertiary effluents collected after UV treatment except for imatinib. Doxorubicin, etoposide, megestrol and prednisone were completely eliminated in the first stage of the WWTP treatment (i.e. detected in the influents, but not in the effluents). Bicalutamide, capecitabine, cydophosphamide, ifosfamide and mycophenolic add were recalcitrant to UV radiation (i.e. detected in tertiary effluents), ifosfamide being the cytostatic most difficult to be removed (its concentration did not decrease from the entrance to the outlet of the WWTP). The risk at which aquatic organisms might be subjected, due to their exposure to cytostatics' concentrations 10-times lower than those found in the tertiary effluents, was estimated and it was verified that mycophenolic add may represent a high risk. Although no risk was estimated for the other cytostatics, the risks associated to long-term and synergic exposure should not be ruled out. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Han River watershed is the largest and most important source of drinking water for the residents of the Seoul metropolitan area and the Gyeonggi province in South Korea. The tributaries of the watershed are vulnerable to contamination by effluents from nearby wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and non-point sources. In this study, a one-year monitoring study was performed to investigate the occurrence of 13 pharmaceuticals in 24 tributaries of the Han River watershed in October 2015. From the 13 pharmaceuticals, 12 were found in at least one sample, with the exception of chlortetracycline, which was not detected. The three most frequently detected compounds were clarithromycin (95.8%), carbamazepine (66.7%), and lincomycin (62.5%). Compounds found in high concentrations included clarithromycin (5.2675 mu g L-1), ibuprofen (1.9646 mu g L-1), and carbamazepine (1.1009 mu g L-1). The total concentration of 12 pharmaceuticals in the Seoul metropolitan area (0.7128 mu g L-1) was higher than that in the Gyeonggi area (0.3177 mu g L-1) possibly due to the large-scale WWTPs located upstream. However, in IHR-3, which is located at the very upstream of the tributary and is not impacted by a WWTP, pharmaceuticals were not detected. This can be explained by the fact that most pharmaceuticals derived from WWTPs are related to human activity. The risk quotients (RQs) for the target pharmaceuticals were calculated on the basis of their presence in tributaries, and all pharmaceuticals presented RQs < 0.01, indicating that potential environmental impacts should be low. These results will be useful to monitor and assess the potential environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in the surface water.

AB Direct photolysis of the emerging contaminant 2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole (TMCTB) was performed in aqueous solution at different concentrations with high-pressure mercury lamp (5.0, 8.0, 13.0, 16.0, 20.0, 23.0, 27.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0, and 50.0 mg L- 1) and with natural sunlight radiation (6.0, 30.0, and 60.0 mg L- 1). TCMTB underwent rapid degradation by direct photolysis with a high-pressure mercury lamp in aqueous solutions, with 99% removal after 30 min at all concentrations studied. For sunlight photolysis, TCMTB degradation was observed with 96%, 81%, and 64% removal for initial concentrations of 6.0, 30.0, and 60.0 mg L- 1, respectively, after 7 h of exposure to sunlight. The degradation of TCMTB in lab-scale wastewater had kinetic constant and t(1/2)in the same order when compared to the photodegradation of TCMTB in aqueous solutions. In addition, the results showed that photolysis with a high-pressure mercury lamp and sunlight were governed by the same kinetic order, however the kinetic parameters showed that degradation with sunlight was 40 times slower than photolysis with the mercury lamp. Twelve transformation products (TP) were identified, and eight of the TP have not been described in the literature. Furthermore, prediction of toxicity with ECOSAR software was carried out for fish, daphnids, and green algae species. It showed that photolytic treatment is efficient for reducing the toxicity of the compound, since the degradation formed compounds with lower toxicity than the primary compound. In conclusion, this study suggests that photolysis is an efficient way to remove the studied contaminant, and it highlights the potential of this technique for the degradation of emerging contaminants in industrial wastewater treatment plants.

AB Traditional swine manure treatments are not fully effective in the removal of veterinary drugs. Moreover, they are costly and entail a significant carbon footprint in many cases. Innovative biological approaches based on phototrophic microorganisms have recently emerged as promising alternatives to overcome those limitations. This work evaluated the removal of 19 veterinary drugs (i.e., 16 antibiotics, 1 analgesic, 1 anti-parasitic and 1 hormone) from piggery wastewater (PWW) in two open photobioreactors (PBR) operated with a consortium of microalgae-bacteria (AB-PBR) and purple photosynthetic bacteria (PPB-PBR). Multiple hydraulic retention times (HRT), in particular 11, 8 and 4 days, were tested during stage I, II and III, respectively. Ten out of 19 target compounds were detected with inlet drug concentrations ranging from 'non-detected' (n.d.) to almost 23,000 ng L-1 for the antibiotic oxytetracycline. Moreover, three of the antibiotics (i.e., enrofloxacin, sulfadiazine and oxytetracycline) were found at concentrations above the analytical linearity range in some or all of the samples under study. AB-PBR supported higher removal efficiencies (REs) than PPB-PBR, except for danofloxacin. Overall, REs progressively decreased when decreasing the HRT. The highest REs (>90%) were observed for doxy-cycline (95 +/- 3%) and oxytetracycline (93 +/- 3%) in AB-PBR during stage I. The other drugs, except sulfadimidine that was the most recalcitrant, showed REs above 70% during stage I in the same photobioreactor. In contrast, removal was observed for danofloxacin in AB-PBR during stage III, sulfadimidine in PPB-PBR during stage III or marbofloxacin in PPB-PBR during the entire experiment.

AB Olfaction is critical for survival, facilitating predator avoidance and food location. The nature of the olfactory system changes during amphibian metamorphosis as the aquatic herbivorous tadpole transitions to a terrestrial, carnivorous frog. Metamorphosis is principally dependent on the action of thyroid hormones (THs), L-thyroxine (T-4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3), yet little is known about their influence on olfaction during this phase of postembryonic development. We exposed Taylor Kollros stage I-XIII Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana tadpoles to physiological concentrations of Teb T-3, or 17-beta-estradiol (E-2) for 48 h and evaluated a predator cue avoidance response. The avoidance response in T-3-exposed tadpoles was abolished while T-4- or E-2-exposed tadpoles were unaffected compared to control tadpoles. qPCR analyses on classic TH-response gene transcripts (thra, thrb, and thibz) in the olfactory epithelium demonstrated that, while both THs produced molecular responses, T-3 elicited greater responses than T-4. Municipal wastewater feed stock was spiked with a defined pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) cocktail and treated with an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). Despite substantially reduced PPCP levels, exposure to this effluent abolished avoidance behavior relative to AnMBR effluent whose feed stock was spiked with vehicle. Thibz transcript levels increased upon exposure to either effluent indicating TH mimic activity. The present work is the first to demonstrate differential TH responsiveness of the frog tadpole olfactory system with both behavioral and molecular alterations. A systems-based analysis is warranted to further elucidate the mechanism of action on the olfactory epithelium and identify further molecular bioindicators linked to behavioral response disruption.

AB Synthetic pharmaceutical effluents loaded with the beta-lactamantibiotic oxacillin were treated using advanced oxidation processes (the photo-Fenton system and TiO2 photocatalysis) and chloride mediated electrochemical oxidation (with Ti/IrO2 anodes). Combinations of the antibiotic with excipients (mannitol or tartaric acid), an active ingredient (calcium carbonate, i.e. bicarbonate ions due to the pH) and a cleaning agent (sodium lauryl ether sulfate) were considered. Additionally, urban wastewater that had undergone biological treatment was doped with oxacillin and treated with the tested systems. The evolution of antimicrobial activity was monitored as a parameter of processes efficiency. Although the two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) differ only in the way they produce center dot OH, marked differences were observed between them. There were also differences between the AOPs and the electrochemical system. Interestingly, each additive had a different effect on each treatment. For water loaded with mannitol, electrochemical treatment was the most suitable option because the additive did not significantly affect the efficiency of the system. Due to the formation of a complex with Fe3+, tartaric acid accelerated the elimination of antibiotic activity during the photo-Fenton process. For TiO2 photocatalysis, the presence of bicarbonate ions contributed to antibiotic activity elimination through the possible formation of carbonate and bicarbonate radicals. Sodium lauryl ether sulfate negatively affected all of the processes. However, due to the higher selectivity of HOCl compared with center dot OH, electrochemical oxidation showed the least inhibited efficiency. For the urban wastewater doped with oxacillin, TiO2 photocatalysis was the most efficient process. These results will help select the most suitable technology for the treatment of water polluted with beta-lactam antibiotics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities supported by a seven-stage, full-scale biological wastewater treatment plant was studied. These reactors were operated at both mesophilic (28 to 32 degrees C) and thermophilic (50 to 58 degrees C) temperatures. Community fingerprint analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the PCR-amplified V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the domain Bacteria revealed that these seven reactors supported three distinct microbial communities. A band-counting analysis of the PCR-DGGE results suggested that elevated reactor temperatures corresponded with reduced species richness. Cloning of nearly complete 16S rRNA genes also suggested a reduced species richness in the thermophilic reactors by comparing the number of clones with different nucleotide inserts versus the total number of clones screened. While these results imply that elevated temperature can reduce species richness, other factors also could have impacted the number of populations that were detected. Nearly complete 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the thermophilic reactors mere dominated by members from the beta subdivision of the division Proteobacteria (beta-proteobacteria) in addition to anaerobic phylotypes from the low-G+C gram-positive and Synergistes divisions. The mesophilic reactors, however, included at least six bacterial divisions, including Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides, Synergistes, Planctolmycetes, low-G+C gram-positives, Holophaga-Acido-bacterium, and Proteobacteria (alpha-proteobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and delta-proteobacteria subdivisions). The two PCR-based techniques detected the presence of similar bacterial populations hut failed to coincide on the relative distribution of these phylotypes, This suggested that at least one of these methods is insufficiently quantitative to determine total community biodiversity-a function of both the total number of species present (richness) and their relative distribution (evenness).

AB Pharmaceutical compounds are considered emerging environmental pollutants that have a potential harmful impact on environment and human health. In this study, the biomass of alga (Scenedesmus obliquus) was modified using alkaline solution, and used for the biosorption of tramadol (TRAM) and other pharmaceuticals. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated. The obtained results reveal high adsorption capacity of tramadol over modified algal biomass (MAB) after 45 min with removal percentage of 91%. Pseudo-second order model was well fitted with the experimental data with correlation coefficient (0.999). Biosorption of tramadol on modified algal biomass proceeds with Freundlich isotherm model with correlation coefficient (0.942) that emphasized uptake of TRAM by MAB is driven by chemisorption. FTIR spectra of MAB before and after the adsorption were analyzed; some IR bands were detected with slight shift and low intensity suggesting their involving in adsorption. The tramadol biosorption by MAB is a chemical process as confirmed by Dubinin-Radushkevich. The adsorption of pharmaceutical over MAB is mainly preceded by hydrophilic interactions between amino and carbonyl groups in pharmaceutical molecules and hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups on surface of biosorbent. It was emphasized by disappearance O-H and C-O from biomass IR spectra after adsorption. In matrix of pharmaceutical, the recorded adsorption capacities for CEFA, PARA, IBU, TRAM and CIP are 68, 58, 42, 42 and 39 mg/g over MAB at natural pH and MAB dose of 0.5 g/L. Furthermore, oxygen uptake by bacteria was applied for estimate the toxicity of pharmaceutical. The recorded result concluded the efficient reusability of modified algal biomass for biosorption of pharmaceuticals, as well only the adsorption efficiency decreased by 4.5% after three runs. Subsequently, the modified algal biomass is a promising reusable adsorbent for decontamination of wastewater from pharmaceuticals.

AB During the last decade, several emerging chemicals, also referred as Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), have raised the interest of the scientific community, because of possible adverse effects on the environment and the living organisms. Although several treatment technologies have been applied for their removal, operation and maintenance costs are prohibitive. Therefore, this study aims to study the treatment of EDCs with an alternative and environmentally friendly technology: constructed wetlands (CWs). For this purpose, 6 pilot-scale CW units of two types, horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) and vertical flow (VF), were used for the treatment of municipal wastewater originating from a university campus, targeting the removal of five EDCs: Bisphenol A (BPA), Nonylphenol (NP), Nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), Nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO) and Triclosan (TCS). Results showed that the median removal performance in HSF-R was 49.6%, 51.4% and 48.4%, in HSF-C was 50.0%, 99.0% and 66.0%, and in HSF-Z was 55.4%, 98.9% and 80.3% for BPA, NP1EO and NP2EO, respectively. NP was not removed but its concentration was increased by 48.0%, 43.7% and 51.9% in the HSF-R, HSF-C and HSF-Z, respectively. TCS was not detected in influent wastewater. In the VF-CWs, the median removal efficiencies were: 45.6%, 12.5%, 41.5% and 72.2% in VF-R, 60.0%, 96.2%, 99.0% and 99.8% in VF-C, and 59.0%, 95.6%, 98.7% and 99.8% in VF-Z for BPA, NP, NP1EO, NP2EO, respectively. The study indicates that the main removal pathways of the target EDCs is their biodegradation under aerobic or/and anaerobic conditions and adsorption onto the organic matter retained in the substrate.

AB Psychiatric pharmaceuticals are the most prescribed active substances throughout the world and their presence in the environment raised concerns. The occurrence and fate of 15 selected psychiatric pharmaceuticals, including eight benzodiazepines, four antidepressants, one antiepileptic and two metabolites of benzodiazepines were investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents, surface water, and final drinking water in Shanghai. Psychiatric pharmaceuticals were in WWTPs influents ranging from low ng L-1 to 68.2 ng L-1, dominated by carbamazepine, doxepin, diazepam and lorazepam. Target analytes were still detected in effluents from low ng L-1 range to 47.3 ng L-1, with carbamazepine, diazepam, and oxazepam as most prevalent. WWTPs were low.effective (<50%) in removing most of them, excluding amitriptyline (mean 60%), doxepin (mean 70%), temazepam (mean 78%) and lorazepam (mean 93%). In addition, carbamazepine, diazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam were detected in low ng L-1 to 75.5 ng L-1 in the surface water of Huang Pu Rive. The pattern of contaminants in surface water is similar to the effluent wastewater, which suggested the main source of organic trace pollutants might be WWTPs. Furthermore, carbamazepine (0.8-2.5 ng L-1), diazepam (0.5-3.2 ng L-1) and alprazolam (2.3 ng L-1) were also detected in drinking water and the concentrations were below the health based precautionary value. The investigation was within the range of those results reported in other countries. Our results indicate ubiquity of the investigated compounds in the aquatic system. These pollutants may potentially reach drinking water via WWTP effluents and/or surface waters and require constant attention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are being increasingly reported in a variety of biological matrices, including fish tissue; however, screening studies have presently not encompassed broad geographical areas. A national pilot study was initiated in the United States to assess the accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in fish sampled from five effluent-dominated rivers that receive direct discharge from wastewater treatment facilities in Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA. Fish were also collected from the Gila River, New Mexico, USA, as a reference condition expected to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic influence. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of pharmaceuticals revealed the presence of norfluoxetine, sertraline, diphenhydramine, diltiazem, and carbamazepine at nanogram-per-gram concentrations in fillet composites from effluent-dominated sampling locations; the additional presence of fluoxetine and gemfibrozil was confirmed in liver tissue. Sertraline was detected at concentrations as high as 19 and 545 ng/g in fillet and liver tissue, respectively. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of personal care products in fillet composites revealed the presence of galaxolide and tonalide at maximum concentrations of 2,100 and 290 ng/g, respectively, and trace levels of triclosan. In general, more pharmaceuticals were detected at higher concentrations and with greater frequency in liver than in fillet tissues. Higher lipid content in liver tissue could not account for this discrepancy as no significant positive correlations were found between accumulated pharmaceutical concentrations and lipid content for either tissue type from any sampling site. In contrast, accumulation of the personal care products galaxolide and tonalide was significantly related to lipid content. Results suggest that the detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products was dependent on the degree of wastewater treatment employed.

TI COMPARISON OF 2 STRATEGIES FOR ASSESSING ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY

DE INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENT; PHARMACEUTICALS; TOXICITY; BIOACCUMULATION
AB The potential environmental impact of wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical plant was evaluated by two different characterization strategies. The aim of the first strategy was to characterize the complex ef fluent before and after degradation by activated sludge. Chemical analyses (AOX, EOX, DOC, TOC, BOD, COD(Cr), N-total, N-NH4, N-NO2, N-NO3, P-total, and P-PO4) were performed on the undegraded and the degraded sample. Ecotoxicological tests were performed on the undegraded sample (acute toxicity, Microtox(R), inhibition of respiration of activated sludge, inhibition of nitrification of activated sludge) and on the degraded sample (acute toxicity, Microtox). Moreover, the concentration of potentially bioaccumulating substances was determined in the degraded sample. The tests were done according to the STORK Project (characterization of persistent organic compounds in industrial effluents) initiated by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The second characterization strategy was concentrated on single substances in the effluent. The amount of all discharged chemicals was estimated using mass-balance calculations or by chemical analysis of the water phase. Ecotoxicological data for several of the substances were drawn from the reference literature. For those without any ecotoxicological information, a limited set of tests was performed (Microtox, octanol/water partition coefficient, biodegradation). All substances were classified on the basis of environmental effects using acute toxicity, biodegradation, and bioaccumulation criteria.
   The two different characterization strategies were useful when predicting environmental effects of wastewater from a chemical-pharmaceutical plant. From a practical and economical point of view, a stepwise approach including elements from both of the above strategies is recommended. A chemical-oriented strategy (discharged amount and ecotoxicological data for each compound) may be useful as a primary step for sorting out hazardous water phases from harmless ones. For less defined water phases, an extensive characterization program, including chemical analyses, acute toxicity testing, and ecotoxicological parameters, may give valuable information about environmental risks.

AB Oxidative degradation of emerging waterborne contaminants, particularly pharmaceuticals, is currently an extensively studied field of research. In this study, a UV-254 nm activated persulfate (PS) system (UV254/PS) was used to eliminate Theophylline (TP) from simulated and real industrial effluents. Results showed that TP is strongly resistant to degradation through direct photolysis under UV-254 nm irradiation. UV254/PS system showed efficient degradation, in which [PS](0) = 0.25 mM achieved total degradation of [TP](0) = 10 mg L-1 in a period of 20 min and followed a pseudo-first order reaction kinetics (k(obs) = 0.173 (+/- 0.004) min(-1)). Effect of several matrix parameters were tested to study the robustness of TP degradation in real-life cases such as pH, chlorides, bicarbonates, and dissolved oxygen, in which neutral pH gave the highest degradation rate (k(obs) = 0.40 (+/- 0.03) min(-1)), chlorides and bicarbonates showed minimal impact, and anoxic conditions inhibited TP degradation with a significant decrease in k(obs) e.g. 0.817 (+/- 0.41) x 10(-1) min(-1). Additionally, TP was spiked into natural spring, sea and wastewater, where the three tested matrices showed a decrease in the degradation rate, with the latter being the most significant (k(obs) = 6.9 (+/- 0.9) x 10(-3) min(-1)). Radical scavenging experiments showed that sulfate radicals were the main contributors in TP degradation. Furthermore, wastewater effluent obtained from a local pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and containing [TP](0) = 160 mg L-1 was also tested and showed successful full degradation over 3 h in 25 mM PS-spiked medium with an average reaction stoichiometric efficiency of about 3.7% and at an estimated cost of 17.2 $ m(-3).

AB The Mississippi River drainage basin includes the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas rivers. These rivers drain areas with different physiography, population centers, and land use, with each contributing a different suites of metals and wastewater contaminants that can affect water quality. In July 2012, we determined 18 elements (Be, Rb, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the five major tributaries and in the Upper Mississippi River. The following summer, we determined both trace elements and 25 trace organic compounds at 10 sites in a longitudinal study of the main stem of the Mississippi River from Grafton, Illinois to Natchez, Mississippi. We detected wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, throughout the river system, with the highest concentrations occurring near urban centers (St. Louis and Memphis). Concentrations were highest for atrazine (673 ng L-1), DEET (540 ng L-1), TCPP (231 ng L-1), and caffeine (202 ng L-1). The Illinois, Missouri, and Yazoo rivers, which drain areas with intense agriculture, had relatively high concentrations of Chl-a and atrazine. However, the Ohio River delivered higher loads of contaminants to the Mississippi River, including an estimated 177 kg day(-1) of atrazine, due to higher flow volumes. Concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cd, and Zn) were relatively high in the Illinois River and low in the Ohio River, although dissolved metal concentrations were below US EPA maximum contaminant levels for surface water. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the rivers can be distinguished based on elemental and contaminant profiles.

AB The widespread occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in aquatic environment has become a worldwide concern. This work investigated the removal of four representative emerging PhACs, including carbamazepine (CBZ), crotamiton (CTMT), N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and ibuprofen (IBP) in two internal circulation biological aerated filters (IcBAFs). Results showed that DEET (> 95%) and IBP (> 80%) were removed efficiently in the IcBAFs, whereas CTMT (< 30%) and CBZ (< 5%) were poorly removed due to their recalcitrant characteristics. The mechanism for DEET and IBP removal in the IcBAFs was biodegradation and autotrophic microbes were responsible for their degradation. The major biotransformation products of IBP included hydroxy-IBP and 1-(4-isobutylphenyl) ethanol, while one major biodegradation product of DEET was identified as N, N-diethylbenzamide. In addition, the removal of residual PhACs in IcBAF effluents by various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were evaluated in either batch or continuous-flow mode. The results showed that the low-pressure UVA/Fe-III-EDDS/H2O2 process was very effective for the treatment of residual PhACs in IcBAF effluents under neutral pH conditions, e. g., resulting in more than 90% degradation of the PhACs in continuous-flow mode. The impacts of photo-Fenton reagents doses (i. e., Fe-III-EDDS dose, H2O2 dose and the EDDS:Fe-III molar ratio), as well as the UV light sources (UVA/UVC) and intensities on the residual PhACs removal were evaluated in detail. The LC-QTOF-MS analysis revealed that not only the target PhACs but also their biodegradation byproducts were efficiently degraded by the low-pressure UVA/Fe-III-EDDS/H2O2 process, suggesting that this process had great potential for the treatment of residual PhACs in wastewater after biotreatment.

AB This work aims to integrate several hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation mechanisms, photolysis (UVC irradiation), chemical electron transfer (TiO2-P25 photocatalysis), and reaction with TiO2-P25 in dark conditions, for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation towards the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), in a single unit operated in continuous-flow mode. An H2O2 stock solution is fed by the lumen side of a tubular ceramic membrane, delivering the oxidant to the (i) catalyst immobilized in the membrane shell-side and (ii) annular reaction zone (ARZ, space between membrane shell-side and outer quartz tube) where CECs contaminated water flows with a helix trajectory, being activated by UV light provided by four lamps placed symmetrically around the reactor. First, the effect of several parameters in the removal of a CEC target molecule, amoxicillin (AMX), was evaluated using a synthetic solution ([AMX](inlet) = 2.0 mg L-1): (i) light source (UVA or UVC radiation), (ii) H2O2 dose, (iii) H2O2 injection method (radial permeation vs. upstream injection), and (iv) number of TiO2-P25 layers deposited on the membrane. The UVC/H2O2/TiO2 system with radial addition of H2O2 (20 mg L-1) and 9-TiO2-P25 layers provided the highest AMX removal efficiency (72.2 +/- 0.5%) with a UV fluence of 45 mJ cm(-2) (residence time of 4.6 s), due to the synergic effect of four mechanisms: (i) AMX photolysis, (ii) H2O2 photocleavage, (iii) TiO2-P25 photoactivation, and (iv) chemical reactions between H2O2 and TiO2-P25. The urban wastewater matrix showed a negative effect on AMX removal (similar to 44%) due to the presence of ROS scavengers and light-filtering species.

TI A facile calcination conversion of groundwater treatment sludge (GTS) as
   magnetic adsorbent for oxytetracycline adsorption
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, groundwater treatment sludge (GTS) was recycled as a magnetic adsorbent via a facile calcination process without adding any reductant. The prepared magnetic adsorbents (MAs) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnenometer (VSM) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results showed that GTS comprised 33.2% Fe, 1.4% Al and 6.2% Si, and exhibited a weak saturation magnetization of 0.0008 emu/g. Without NaOH, the GTS calcinated at 700 and 500 degrees C were well magnetized with Ms of 20.1 and 7.1 emu/g, separately, but exhibited a low Ms of 0.43 emu/g at 300 degrees C. By adding NaOH powder, the Ms of GTS apparently increased to 4.9 emu/g after calcination at 300 degrees C, and further to 8.5 emu/g at 500 degrees C. In GTS, about 96.1% Fe was involved in ferrihydrite form. The Ms of calcinated GTS was accompanied with the phase transformation of ferrihydrite to maghemite. Si/Al oxides in GTS coordinated on the surface sites of ferrihydrite and inhibited the conjunction and phase transformation of adjacent ferrihydrite particles, but were effectively desorbed as in the presence of NaOH. Na500, preparing by calcinating GTS at 500 degrees C with NaOH, showed an optimal total surface sites (H-s) of 0.65 mmol/g. Oxytetracycline (OTC) was used as a target for studying the adsorption characteristics of synthetic magnetic adsorbents and a high adsorption capacity of oxytetracycline of 862.1 mg/g in comparison with the other calcinated GTS, and the adsorption data was consistent with the Langmuir model. By adding 6 g/L Na-500, approximately 100% of oxytetracycline and tetracycline and nearly 40% total organic carbon were removed from real pharmaceutical wastewater. With the method, GTS can be converted in mass production to magnetic adsorbent that exhibits effective application in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The occurrence and distribution of five groups of antibiotics were investigated in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary over four seasons. Four tetracyclines (TCs), sulfaquinoxaline (SQ), enrofloxacin (EFC) and thiamphenicol (TAP) were detected in all the samples, while sulfamerazine (SM) and sulfathiazole (ST) showed the lowest detection frequency. The detection frequencies and antibiotic concentrations were generally higher in January and May, indicating that low flow conditions and low temperature might enhance the persistence of antibiotics in sediment. Antibiotic levels varied with location, with the highest concentrations being observed around river discharges and sewage outfalls. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the concentration of quinolones and TOC revealed the significant role played by TOC. The concentration of quinolones at Wusongkou exceeded the trigger value (0.10 mg kg(-1)) of the Steering Committee of the Veterinary International Committee on Harmonization (VICH), which should be paid attention to in future studies.

AB Exposure to contaminants below lethal concentrations may affect the performance of organisms, resulting in measurable differences in behavior. We measured the response of the benthic invertebrate Gammarus pulex (Crustacea, Amphipoda) to sublethal concentrations of three pharmaceuticals, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Responses in behavior during exposure were analyzed using the multivariate method of Principal Response Curves (PRC). The PRC results show that exposure to low pharmaceutical concentrations (range 1-100 ng/l) resulted in increased ventilation, whereas exposure to control or to high concentrations (1 mu g/l-1 mg/L) resulted in increased locomotion. Exposure to CTAB resulted in decreased locomotion and increased ventilation at increasing concentrations. The results of our experiments indicate that increased ventilation can be used as a general sign of stress, but not necessarily an early warning signal for mortality.

AB Degradation rates and removal efficiencies of Metronidazole using UV, UV/H2O2, H2O2/Fe2+, and LTV/H2O2/Fe2+ were studied in de-ionized water. The four different oxidation processes were compared for the removal kinetics of the antimicrobial pharmaceutical Metronidazole. It was found that the degradation of Metronidazole by UV and UV/ H2O2 exhibited pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. By applying H2O2/Fe2+, and UV/H2O2/Fe2+ the degradation kinetics followed a second order behavior. The quantum yields for direct photolysis, measured at 254 mn and 200400 nm, were 0.0033 and 0.0080 mol E-1, respectively. Increasing the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide promoted the oxidation rate by UV/ H2O2. Adding more ferrous ions enhanced the oxidation rate for the H2O2/Fe2+ and UV/H2O2/Fe2+ processes. The major advantages and disadvantages of each process and the complexity of comparing the various advanced oxidation processes on an equal basis are discussed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of three estrogens such as 17 beta-estradiol, two endocrine disruptors like bisphenol A, and 10 pharmaceutical substances like ibuprofen (IBP) by activated sludge was experimentally examined. The contribution of adsorption and degradation to the overall removal was estimated separately and successfully. At the neutral pH condition, the target pharmaceutical substances showed little tendency of adsorption to the sludge and their water-sludge partition coefficients were lower than those of the target estrogens. On the other hand, the increasing tendency of adsorption was observed in the lower pH condition. A linear relationship between the log of the partitioning coefficient and log K-ow was observed when pH was lowered to keep the pharmaceuticals neutral solutes. The acidic operational condition was preferable for the removal of acidic pharmaceutical substances because the limiting stage for the removal was not biodegradation but the transfer of substances from the water phase to the sludge phase.

AB This work describes the production of alternative adsorbents from industrial residues and their application for the removal of a highly consumed antidepressant (citalopram) from water. The adsorbents were produced by pyrolysis of both primary and biological paper mill sludge at different temperatures and residence times. The original sludge and the produced chars were fully characterized by elemental and proximate analyses, total organic carbon, specific surface area (BET), N-2 isotherms, FTIR, C-13 and H-1 solid state NMR and SEM. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out to describe the adsorption of citalopram onto the produced materials. The fastest kinetics and the highest adsorption capacity were obtained using primary sludge pyrolysed at 800 degrees C during 150 min. The use of pyrolysed paper mill sludge for the remediation of contaminated waters might constitute an interesting application for the valorization of those wastes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals are becoming an emerging environmental issue that attracts increasing attention in recent years. This study chose tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) as examples of pharmaceuticals. Crude lignin peroxidase (LiP) produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium were used to degrade TC and OTC in vitro. The results illustrated that UP has a strong degrading ability towards TC and OTC. At 50 mg L-1 of TC and OTC and 40 U L-1 of the enzyme activity, the degradation of TC and OTC reached to about 95% in 5 min. The degradation of TC and OTC by UP was dependent on pH and temperature and was largely enhanced by increasing the concentrations of veratryl alcohol (VA) and initial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The optimized degradation conditions were determined as pH 4.2, 37 degrees C, 2 mM VA, 0.4 mM H2O2. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Migration is an important life-history event in a wide range of taxa, yet many migrations are influenced by anthropogenic change. Although migration dynamics are extensively studied, the potential effects of environmental contaminants on migratory physiology are poorly understood. In this study we show that an anxiolytic drug in water can promote downward migratory behaviour of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in both laboratory setting and in a natural river tributary. Exposing salmon smolt to a dilute concentration of a GABAA receptor agonist (oxazepam) increased migration intensity compared with untreated smolt. These results implicate that salmon migration may be affected by human-induced changes in water chemical properties, such as acidification and pharmaceutical residues in wastewater effluent, via alterations in the GABAA receptor function.

AB While traces of pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment, the pharmaceutical industry produces waste streams high in pharmaceutically active compounds concentration along with other components such as salts. This work investigated the removal of three common pharmaceuticals, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, at concentrations found in the pharmaceutical industry, under different monovalent salt concentrations of sodium chloride using a commercially available nanofiltration membrane. The influence of a monovalent salt concentration and temperature on the removal were determined. Pharmaceutical rejection was found to be dependent on the compounds' molecular weights, charge, and hydrophobicity. Diclofenac and ibuprofen rejections were found to be high (90-99%) and (85-96%) respectively, and the rejection increased with increasing salt concentration. Meanwhile, moderate retention values were found for the neutral carbamazepine (65-77%) and these values decreased with increasing salt concentration, and also decreased with increasing temperatures. A threshold salt concentration was found at which these effects were buffered or even reversed.

AB A method for simultaneous analysis of ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV) and norfloxacin (NOR) in mangrove sediment was developed using aqueous ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), solid phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). The method showed excellent linear correlation coefficient for the three fluoroquinolones (r(2) > 0.999) using external calibration curve and good recovery in real sediment samples ranging from 73.73 to 88.85%. The precision showed a relative standard deviation lower than 20% and detection limits of 1.10, 3.33 and 0.26 mu g kg(-1) to CIP, LEV and NOR, respectively. There was no presence of interfering. After validation, the method was applied in the determination of pharmaceuticals in mangrove sediment in the Paciencia River, Maranhao Island, Brazil. Only the CIP antibiotic was found in three of six samples analyzed, with values ranging 56.55-70.45 mu g kg(-1).

AB Ten antibiotics belonging to three groups (macrolides, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides) were investigated in riverine runoff of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China for assessing the importance of riverine runoff in the transportation of contaminants from terrestrial sources to the open ocean. All antibiotics were detected in the eight outlets with concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 127 ng L-1. The annual mass loadings of antibiotics from the PRD to the PRE and coast were 193 tons with 102 tons from the fluoroquinolone group. It showed that antibiotics decreased from the riverine outlets to the PRE and open ocean. Risk assessment showed that most of these antibiotics showed various ecological risks to the relevant aquatic organisms, in which ofloxacin (OFL), erythromycin (ETM) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) posed high ecological risks to the studied aquatic environments.

AB A new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) adsorbent for clofibric acid (CA) was prepared by a non-covalent protocol. Characterization of the obtained MIP was achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen sorption. Sorption experimental results showed that the MIP had excellent binding affinity for CA and the adsorption of CA by MIP was well described by pseudo-second-order model. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that two classes of binding sites were formed in the MIP with dissociation constants of 7.52 +/- 0.46 mg L-1 and 114 +/- 4.2 mg L-1, respectively. The selectivity of MIP demonstrated higher affinity for CA over competitive compound than that of non-imprinted polymers (NIP). The MIP synthesized was used to remove CA from spiked surface water and exhibited significant binding affinity towards CA in the presence of total dissolved solids (TDS). In addition, MIP reusability was demonstrated for at least 12 repeated cycles without significant loss in performance.

AB The removal efficiency of 22 selected trace organic contaminants by sequential application of granular activated carbon (GAC) and simultaneous application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) with membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared in this study. Both sequential application of GAC following MBR treatment (MBR-GAC) and simultaneous application of PAC within MBR (PAC-MBR) achieved improved removal (over 95%) of seven hydrophilic and biologically persistent compounds, which were less efficiently removed by MBR-only treatment (negligible to 70%). However, gradual breakthrough of these compounds occurred over an extended operation period. Charged compounds, particularly, fenoprop and diclofenac, demonstrated the fastest breakthrough (complete and 50-70%, in MBR-GAC and PAC-MBR, respectively). Based on a simple comparison from the long-term performance stability and activated carbon usage points of view, PAC-MBR appears to be a better option than MBR-GAC treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Removal characteristics of sulfamethazine (SMZ) by sludge and a bacterial strain using an aerobic sequence batch reactor (ASBR) were studied. Operating conditions were optimized by varying the reaction time and sludge retention time (SRT). An Achromobacter sp. (S-3) with the ability to remove SMZ was isolated from the ASBR. The effects of different operating parameters (pH and temperature) on the biodegradation of SMZ by S-3 were determined. The results indicate that, between 0.5 and 4 hr, reaction time of the ASBR had a significant effect on the SMZ removal efficiency in the system. The SMZ removal efficiency also increased from 45% to 80% when SRT was prolonged from 5 to 25 days, although longer SRT had no impact on SMZ removal. The SMZ adsorption rate decreased with increasing temperature, which fitted Freundlich isotherm well. The removal of SMZ in the ASBR was due to the combined effects of adsorption and degradation, and degradation played a leading role.

TI APPLICATION OF ELECTROACOUSTICS FOR DEWATERING PHARMACEUTICAL SLUDGE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Application of electro acoustic principles for dewatering has been developed by Battelle Institute.  The Department of Energy, Battelle Institute, and Ashbrook-Simon-Hartley, have jointly developed an Electro Acoustic Dewatering press (EAD press).  The EAD press applies a combination of mechanical pressure, electrical current and ultrasonics.  This press is utilized after conventional dewatering devices and can remove up to 50% water from filtered sludge cake at a fraction of the cost incurred in existing thermal drying devices.  The dominant mechanism of sludge dewatering by EAD press if electro-osmosis due to the application of a direct current field.  Electro-osmosis is caused by an electrical double layer of oppositely charged ions formed at the solid liquid interface, which is characterized by zeta potential.  The ultrasonic fields help electro-osmosis by consolidation of the filter cake and by release of inaccessible liquid.  The EAD press has been tested successfully on a variety of materials including apple pomace, corn gluten, sewage sludge, and coal fines.  A three week long full scale trial was conducted successfully at a pharmaceutical industry to determine the application of this technology for dewatering waste activated sludge.

AB One of the most common organic compounds which represents real challenges in the environmental pollution treatment is the xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs). They are complex organic compounds which have high persistence in the environment extend for several years due to their chemical structure. Meanwhile, its hazards risk lies in tier active poisons which directly affect aquatic life within a short exposure time. XOCs in the greywater are generated from utilisation of detergents and personal body care products and they have the potential to persist in nature for a long time and thus have long-term effects to the environment including toxicity and bioaccumulation in the organism's cells. There are many literatures discussing about the types of XOCs of greywater. For instance, some types of XOCs in greywater are toxic for aquaculture. This chapter will discuss the occurrence of XOCs in the greywater, chemical structure and bioassay for the toxicity of these compounds.

AB In this study, the photo-ozonation reaction for carbamazepine (CBZ) removal was investigated under alkaline conditions. Response surface methodology based on a central composite design was used to obtain the optimum experimental conditions, and examine both main and interaction effects of the photo-ozonation reaction variables such as O-3 concentration, H2O2 concentration and UV intensity. The level of O-3 concentration significantly influenced CBZ removal (p < 0.001). CBZ removal increased with increasing both O-3 and H2O2 concentration up to a certain level, whereas further increase in O-3 and H2O2 concentration resulted in an adverse effect due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect. The optimum conditions for complete CBZ removal at pH 9 were found to be 0.89 mg of O-3 l(-1), 4.85 mg of H2O2 l(-1) and 3.18 mW of UV intensity cm(-2), respectively.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) - based metabolomics has the potential to identify toxic responses of contaminants within a mixture in contaminated soil. This study evaluated the metabolic response of Eisenia fetida after exposure to an array of organic compounds to determine whether contaminant-specific responses could be identified. The compounds investigated in contact tests included: two pesticides (carbaryl and chlorpyrifos), three pharmaceuticals (carbamazephine, estrone and caffeine), two persistent organohalogens (Aroclor 1254 and PBDE 209) and two industrial compounds (nonylphenol and dimethyl phthalate). Control and contaminant-exposed metabolic profiles were distinguished using principal component analysis and potential contaminant-specific biomarkers of exposure were found for several contaminants. These results suggest that NMR-based metabolomics offers considerable promise for differentiating between the different toxic modes of action (MOA) associated with sub-lethal toxicity to earthworms.

AB Ozonation and chlorination of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), and nonylphenol (NP) were performed to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the by-products of these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). After 15 min oxidation, samples were extracted using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and tested in vitro to measure the estrogenic activities of the oxidized products. MCF-7 cell proliferation assay showed that chlorinated BPA solution displayed slightly stronger estrogenicity than BPA, while chlorinated NP retained about one-tenth of its bioactivity. The estrogenic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-CIBPAs and di-CINP were screened out from the corresponding chlorinated products by a combined application of estrogen receptor (ER) binding with ultrafiltration and identified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Ozonation of the above four estrogens and chlorination of E2 and EE2 significantly decreased their estrogenic activities under the applied conditions.

AB The distribution, sources, and risk assessment of eight quinotone antibiotics (QNs) in the surface sediments from the wetland in Jiaozhou Bay were investigated. The results showed that QNs were detected in all samples, and the total concentrations of QNs in the sediments ranged from 0.276 to 5.229 ng/g. The highest concentration occurred at the entrance to the Yang River wetland. Principal component analysis suggested that the QNs mainly originated from sewage discharges from hospitals, human and aquaculture industries. Risk assessment, based on risk quotients, indicated the current ofloxacin level might be a medium risk level, while other QNs were all low risk. Nevertheless, there should still be concerns due to high consumption of QNs by human beings, animals, and aquatic organisms in the wetland. This investigation provides baseline data that the government can use as a reference guide to control QNs residues in Jiaozhou Bay wetland.

AB This paper investigates the elimination of drugs of abuse from six different chemical classes and their metabolites in natural fluvial waters (nearby the output of a sewage system). Mineralization of these substances and toxicological characterization before and after treatment by a heterogeneous photo-Fenton system has been evaluated. This advanced oxidation technology was able to significantly reduce the concentration of the drugs of abuse in all the tested conditions (different hydrogen peroxide and catalyst loadings). However, toxicological analyses measured as inhibition of fern spore mitochondrial activity, showed only a complete elimination of acute and chronic toxicity when a higher solid catalyst loading was used (0.6 g/L). A lower catalyst loading of 0.2 g/L was not enough for toxicity elimination. These results evidence the need for combining toxicological tests and chemical analyses in order to establish the effectiveness of the water treatment technologies based on advanced oxidation processes.

AB Numerous human and veterinary pharmaceuticals are constantly entering surface waters, despite little understanding of their potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. To address this concern, an attempt to create a simple, reproducible, inexpensive, and sublethal toxicity bioassay for freshwater zooplankton was initiated. The approach was centered on characterizing the response of a zooplankton enzyme, chitobiase, to the presence of a toxicant. The aim of the present research was to develop a reproducible laboratory-based assay for Daphnia magna chitobiase activity and to screen four commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals using that assay. The four pharmaceuticals tested for potential effects on D. magna chitobiase activity were atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluoxetine, and sertraline. We were able to detect exposure-associated differences in chitobiase activity at concentrations of 0.1 mu g/L fluoxetine after 24 and 72 hours of exposure. Differences were also detected for the other compounds. The response of chitobiase was found to be promising as an assay to measure sublethal effects in D. magna and perhaps other zooplankton species.

AB Batch experiment was conducted to investigate if anaerobic intermediate stages can affect biotransformation and sorption performance of selected pharmaceutical compounds (stimulant caffeine (CAF), anti-diabetic drug gliclazide (GCZ) and anti-hypertensive drug prazosin (PRZ)). The outcome revealed that CAF was removed solely via biotransformation and followed the methanogenic pathway. Sorption was significant during the fermentation stage for hydrophobic GCZ and PRZ although both compounds continued to biotransform in the later stage of incubation. While more than 95% removal of all compounds was achieved after 30 d of incubation under anaerobic mesophilic condition, further incubation to Day 90 resulted in re-occurrences of GCZ and PRZ in the aqueous and solid phase. Biotransformation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds could not be represented in the same kinetic model considering sorption and retransformation displayed significant effect to the model. This study also reported the first removal of GCZ and PRZ under anaerobic condition.

AB The entry of pharmaceuticals into the water cycle from sewage treatment plants is of growing concern because environmental effects are evident at trace levels. Ozonation, UV- and UV/H2O2-treatment were tested as an additional step in waste water treatment because they have been proven to be effective in eliminating aqueous organic contaminants. The pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole as well as the personal care products galaxolide and tonalide were investigated in terms of degradation efficiency and by-product formation in consideration of toxic effects. The substances were largely removed from treatment plant effluent by ozonation, UV- and UV/H2O2-treatment. Transformation products were detected in all tested treatment processes. Accompanying analysis showed no genotoxic, cytotoxic or estrogenic potential for the investigated compounds after oxidative treatment of real waste waters. The results indicate that by-product formation from ozonation and advanced oxidation processes does not have any negative environmental impact.

AB The release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into the environment has been held up as a potential threat to ecosystem and human health. Using a custom-designed survey of residents living in Xiamen, China, this paper examines individuals' disposal practices, awareness of the environmental impact of PPCPs, and willingness to pay for measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of PPCPs being released into the environment. The vast majority of respondents report that they dispose of PPCPs through the thrash. The results of a contingent valuation experiment suggest a substantial willingness to pay (WTP) for policy measures aimed at reducing PPCP pollution. Income as well as subjective perceptions relating to overall financial health, expenditure on PPCPs, and overall concern with environmental issues emerged as significant predictors of respondents' WTP. Our results should be of interest to policymakers looking for ways to mitigate the introduction of PPCPs in the environment. (C) 2015 SETAC

Stabilization/Solidification (S/S or bricks) process was applied to make a safer way for the utilization of pharmaceutical waste. The additives in this study include binders (cement, lime and bentonite) and strengthening material (pulverized fuel ash (PFA), silica fume and quarry dust) was used at different compositions. Bricks were cured for 28 days, and the following analysis-like compressive strength, leachability of heavy metals, mineralogical phase identity by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal behaviour by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) had done. All the bricks were observed to achieve the standard compressive strength as required for construction according to BIS standards. Metal concentration in the leachate has reached the dischargeable limits according to Brazilian standards. Results of this study demonstrate that production of bricks is a promising and achievable productive use of pharmaceutical sludge.

AB While antibiotics are frequently found in the environment, their biodegradability and ecotoxicological effects are not well understood. Ciprofloxacin inhibits active and growing microorganisms and therefore can represent an important risk for the environment, especially for soil microbial ecology and microbial ecosystem services. We investigated the biodegradation of C-14-ciprofloxacin in water and soil following OECD tests (301B, 307) to compare its fate in both systems. Ciprofloxacin is recalcitrant to biodegradation and transformation in the aqueous system. However, some mineralisation was observed in soil. The lower bioavailability of ciprofloxacin seems to reduce the compound's toxicity against microorganisms and allows its biodegradation. Moreover, ciprofloxacin strongly inhibits the microbial activities in both systems. Higher inhibition was observed in water than in soil and although its antimicrobial potency is reduced by sorption and aging in soil, ciprofloxacin remains biologically active over time. Therefore sorption does not completely eliminate the effects of this compound. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ketoprofen, 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is considered as an important water pollutant. Kinetics and mechanism of its photolytic transformation in aqueous solutions was studied experimentally and partial reaction steps were modelled by means of quantum chemistry methods. While the rate of ketoprofen photolysis was not significantly affected by its acid-base equilibrium, a marked influence of pH on the subsequent degradation reactions was observed. At pH 1.3, two oxygenated primary products were identified, that underwent fast photolysis. Deprotonated form of ketoprofen was transformed preferentially to ethylbenzophenone and further degradation proceeded substantially slower. Oxygen participated on photolytic processes both as a reactant and the triplet state quencher. The active involvement of water molecules in the reaction mechanism was investigated by comparative experiments in acetonitrile. The phototransformation mechanism proposed based on the experimental data corresponded well with the theoretical results.

AB The acute and chronic toxicological effects of Carbamazepine (CBZ) on Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa were explored for the first time in this study. The results showed that CBZ could significantly inhibit the growth of the two algae in almost all treatment groups. EC50 values indicated that, CBZ had a relatively limited acute toxic effect (0-144h) on S. obliquus and C. pyrenoidosa, while, chronic tests (5-30 d) displayed higher toxicity. Chlorophyll a syntheses were nearly all inhibited by CBZ exposure. However, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in acute tests of both algae were markedly promoted. According to the results, Chlorophyll a content and CAT activity of S. obliquus were more sensitive to CBZ than that of C. pyrenoidosa. While for SOD, quite to the contrary, C. pyrenoidosa was more vulnerable. We obtained a similar result in chronic tests. This research furthers our understanding of CBZ toxicity to aquatic organisms.

AB The present study investigated the influence of electric field on the removal of quorum sensing (QS) and emerging contaminants using an electrochemical membrane bioreactor (eMBR). A significant reduction of N-octanoyl- L-homoserine lactone signal molecules (similar to 76%) was achieved in the eMBR, with respect to the level observed in the conventional MBR as the control. Furthermore, the intermittent electric current supply (0.5 mA/cm(2)) was found to be effective for the removal of atrazine and estrone. The degradation of key pharmaceutical compounds, such as diclofenac, carbamazepine, and amoxicillin, was also possible, confirming the applicability of the eMBR system for removing the priority chemical compounds of public health concern.

AB Occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in drinking water was investigated in southern China. Fifteen and twelve PPCPs were detected with concentrations of 036 ng L-1 in source water and of 0-20 ng L-1 in treated water, respectively. Four PPCPs were detected with concentrations of approximately 1 ng L-1 in drinking water of distribution network. Conventional water treatment processes removed the types and average concentrations of PPCPs by 30% and above 50%, respectively. Advanced water treatment processes were more efficient in the removal of most PPCPs, with the types and concentrations reduced by 50% and approximately 90%, respectively. Molecular properties of PPCPs had an important influence on their behaviors during water treatment. pK(a) (acidity coefficient) and K-oc (organic carbon partition coefficient) of PPCPs appeared to have a combined effect on PPCPs removal during coagulation and oxidation. Adsorption and biodegradation were two possible mechanisms responsible for PPCPs removal during sand filtration.

AB Hydrolysis of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) and dodecamethylcyclohexasilane (D6_silane) and their sorption to digested sludge was studied in batch experiments. Hydrolysis was affected by the type of the compound and the applied temperature, while the relevant half-life values ranged between 0.07 +/- 0.01 d (D3, 55 degrees C) and 48.4 +/- 17.1 d (D6_silane, 4 degrees C). D5 showed the greatest affinity for sorption to digested sludge (logK(d): 3.84 +/- 3.42), the lowest LogK(d) value was found for D3 (1.46 +/- 0.95). Prediction of investigated compounds' fate in a single-stage anaerobic digestion system indicated that volatilization seems to be the major fate in both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The addition of a pre-digester with 3 d retention time would significantly decrease the expected concentrations of all siloxanes in bio-gas, enhancing their removal through hydrolysis and sorption to sludge.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A variety of pharmaceuticals enter waterways by way of treated wastewater effluents and remain biochemically active in aquatic systems. Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. As such, our results show that anxiolytic drugs in surface waters alter animal behaviors that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences.

AB Amoxicillin's traces within pharmaceutical effluents have toxic impact toward the algae and other lower organisms within food web. Adsorption, as an efficient process to remove contaminants from water was chosen; in particular with bentonite and activated carbon as adsorbents. The study was carried out at several pH values. Langmuir and Freundlich models were then employed to correlate the equilibria data on which both models equally well-fit the data. For kinetic data, pseudo-first and second order models are selected. While chemisorption is the dominant adsorption mechanism on the bentonite case, both physisorption and chemisorption play important roles for adsorption onto activated carbon. Also, several possible mechanisms for these adsorption systems were elaborated further. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Four artificial composite soil treatment systems (ACSTs) fed with reclaimed water containing trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were constructed to investigate SMX and TMP biodegradation efficiency, ammonia and nitrite removal conditions and the microbial community within ACST layers. Results showed SMX and TMP removal rates could reach 80% and 95%, respectively, and removal rates of ammonia and nitrite could reach 80% and 90%, respectively, in ACSTs. The MiSeq sequencing results showed that microbial community structures of the ACSTs were similar. The dominant microbial community in the adsorption and biodegradation layers of the ACSTs contained Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Nitrospirae. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were considerably dominant in the ACST biodegradation layers. The entire experimental results indicated that Nitrosomonadaceae_uncultured, Nitrospira and Bacillus were associated with nitrification processes, while Bacillus and Lactococcus were associated with SMX and TMP removal processes. The findings suggest that ACSTs are appropriate for engineering applications.

AB Diclofenac is an acidic pharmaceutically active compound and one of the most frequently detected ones in wastewater. This review discusses the research progress and innovations made in recent years on the mitigation of diclofenac from aqueous media by adsorption. It was observed that activated carbon by intense physical activation, metal organic frameworks, and chitosan-cellulose polymeric adsorbents were the best adsorbents for diclofenac removal. Diclofenac sorption follows mainly pseudo-second order kinetics and was best fit to either Freundlich or Langmuir isotherms. Recent research trends involved the investigation of column and continuous experiments, competitive adsorption, and adsorption with photo-catalytic degradation. Whilst numerous types of adsorbents have been explored, there is still need for mechanistic studies.

AB This paper deals with the degradation of diclofenac by electrochemical oxidation in NaClO4 medium at neutral pH using a FM01-LC reactor equipped with a boron doped diamond electrode (BDD). Microelectrolysis studies were carried out to find the current density domain where hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) formation is favored, 10 <= j <= 20 mA cm(-2). Electrolysis experiments at mean linear flow velocities of 14.6 <= u <= 58.4 cm s(-1) were performed. The experimental set-up achieved 100% diclofenac mineralization with 78% current efficiency and energy consumption of 2.54 kWh m(-3) at j = 15 mA cm(-2) and u = 29.2 cm s(-1).

AB Water reclamation and reuse is playing an increasingly important role in sustainable water resources management. But is water reuse sustainable? To be sustainable, a water reuse project must serve its long-term functional roles without shifting environmental burdens to future generations or producing adverse socio-economic effects. In this paper, we review sustainability assessment methods to aid decision makers in comparing alternative systems, improving environmental performance, and tracking progress toward sustainability. We discuss concerns regarding long-term environmental effects of water reuse systems, including energy demands, impacts on irrigated land, and accumulation and health effects of trace contaminants. We also suggest socio-economic considerations that are key to maintaining long-term benefits of water reuse systems.

AB Pharmaceutical products including analgesics, antibiotics, and antiepileptics are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, lakes, and rivers and have been found in waterways of many countries. The adsorption of two common pharmaceuticals present in surface waters, clarithromycin (CLR) and atenolol (ATN), onto cuttlefish bone powder treated with HCl has been investigated. Adsorption experiments were carried out at different pH conditions and the experimental equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich. For the same experimental conditions (pH=7), the estimated adsorption capacities are from 34.5mgg(-1) for CLR and 39.5mgg(-1) for ATN. The influence of adsorption pH was established for each compound. The negative values of G at different temperatures for all samples indicate the spontaneous nature of the sorption process.

AB The interest of consumers and government organizations on improving the quality of food and its impact on human health is growing in recent years. Consuming low-calorie foodstuffs are increasingly demanded, and the presence of artificial sweeteners plays an important role not only in food but also in waste reaching the environment. Analysis of these compounds is important in assessing food safety and quality. This chapter reviews the analytical approaches for the extraction and reliable identification and quantification of most commonly used artificial sweeteners in food, pharmaceutical, and environmental related matrices. The advantages and disadvantages of determination techniques used are described, with special emphasis on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with different approaches, including applications of high resolution mass spectrometry. The possibility of using new materials for efficient extraction, miniaturized extraction techniques, and the potential for quantification of LC-MS/MS techniques are highlighted as future prospects, based on achievements.

AB This work studied the photocatalysed oxidation of the antibiotic oxolinic acid (OA) in an annular reactor operated with immobilized TiO2 on sintered glass cylinders (SGC). Experiments were carried Out in I I solution of OA (18mg 1(-1)) at pH 9 with oxygen bubbling. Irradiation was performed with black light (36 W). The reaction was monitored by COD, TOC and average oxidation state (AOS) calculations. The antibacterial activity of intermediates was followed using the inhibition halo technique on Escherichia coli cultures. The initial antibiotic concentration decreases in one order of magnitude after 60mm irradiation. and was completely eliminated at 100min reaction. The TOC was reduced in 54% and the AOS reach Values around +3 indicating the formation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids. The oxidation reaction fit well with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model indicating the dependence of reaction rate with initial adsorption step. The antibacterial activity of the Solution decreases with antibiotic removal. demonstrating that intermediates do not present antibiotic activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging Organic Contaminants (EOCs) such as steroidal estrogen hormones are of growing concern in recent years, as trace concentrations of these hormones can cause adverse effects on the environmental and human health. While these hormones have been widely detected in soil and groundwater, effective technology has been lacking for in-situ degradation of these contaminants. This chapter illustrates a new class of stabilized MnO2 nanoparticles and a new in-situ technology for oxidative degradation of EOCs in soil and groundwater. The stabilized nanoparticles were prepared using a low-cost, food-grade Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) as a stabilizer. The nanoparticles were then characterized and tested for their effectiveness for degradation of both aqueous and soil-sorbed E2 (17 beta-estradiol). Column tests confirmed the effectiveness of the nanoparticles for in-situ remediation of soil sorbed E2. The nanoparticle treatment decreased both water leachable and soil-sorbed E2, offering a useful alternative for in-situ remediation of EOCs in the subsurface.

AB Little information is available on the environmental occurrence and ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceutical gestagens released in the aquatic environment. Since eighteen different gestagens were found to be used in France, preliminary exposure and hazard assessment were done. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) suggest that if parent gestagens are expected to be found in the ng l(-1) range, some active metabolites could be present at higher concentrations, although limited data on metabolism and environmental fate limit the relevance of PECs. The biological effects are not expected to be restricted to progestagenic activity. Both anti-androgenic activity (mainly for cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate and their metabolites) and estrogenic activity (mainly for reduced metabolites of levonorgestrel and norethisterone) should also occur. All these molecules are likely to have a cumulative effect among themselves or with other xenoestrogens. Studies on occurrence, toxicity and degradation time are therefore needed for several of these compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption of atenolol on granular activated carbon in a fixed bed column was investigated. This micropollutant was effectively adsorbed onto the activated carbon; therefore, the effect of some operation parameters on the performance of the breakthrough curve was studied. Some adsorption parameters, as the adsorption capacities at breakthrough and saturation time, the length of the mass transfer zone (mtz) and the fractional bed utilization were estimated. Four kinetic models, including Adams-Bohart, Wolborska, Thomas, and Yoon-Nelson model, were used to determine the adsorption parameters and to predict the breakthrough curves. Among all examined models, Thomas and Yoon-Nelson were found to be the most suitable for simulation of the breakthrough curve of atenolol uptake on granular activated carbon fixed bed column.

AB Molybdenum-doped TiO2 organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles were synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions by in situ surface modification using n-butylamine. This was carried out at 150 degrees C at autogeneous pressure over 18 h. n-Butylamine was selected as a surfactant since it produced nanoparticles of the desired size and shape. The products were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, dynamic light-scattering spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Chemical oxygen demand was estimated in order to determine the photodegradation efficiency of the molybdenum-doped TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles in the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents. It was found that molybdenum-doped TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles showed higher photocatalytic efficiency than untreated TiO2 nanoparticles.

AB Emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are mainly resulting from the release of municipal wastewater effluents, which are detected at surface water with lower concentration, and these compounds have an impact on aquatic life. The present research investigates the preparation of zeolite supported ZnO for degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products like benzophenone and caffeine. Incorporation of zeolite enhances the adsorption capacity there by results in improved degradation of PPCPs. The prepared materials were characterised by XRD, SEM, EDS, UV and ICP-OES to confirm the impregnation of ZnO in the zeolite powder, which showed 85% caffeine degradation and 78% of BP-3 degradation with an optimum catalyst load of 70 mg.

AB The environmental fate and effects of pioglitazone prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes were evaluated in an environmental risk assessment following the European Medicines Agency (EMA) "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use": EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. A predicted environment concentration (PEC) for surface water was estimated at 0.023 mu g L(-1), (action limit of 0.01 mu g L(-1)) triggering a comprehensive battery of laboratory evaluations. Pioglitazone and its major metabolites were determined not to significantly adsorb to sewage solids, were not persistent in the aquatic environment, did not bioaccumulate and were non-toxic to aquatic organisms. Pioglitazone does not pose an unacceptable risk to groundwater supplies, with concentrations not anticipated to be a risk to aquatic organisms or human drinking water supplies. Pioglitazone does not pose a risk of secondary poisoning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compounds detected in leachate-affected ground water included detergent metabolites (p-nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, nonylphenol diethoxylate, and octylphenol monoethoxylate), plasticizers (ethanol-2-butoxy-phosphate and diethylphthalate), a plastic monomer (bisphenol A), disinfectants (1,4-dichlorobenzene and triclosan), an antioxidant (5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole), three fire-retardant compounds (tributylphosphate and tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate, and tri(dichlorisopropyl)phosphate), and several pharmaceuticals and metabolites (acetaminophen, caffeine, cotinine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, fluoxetine, and ibuprofen). Acetaminophen, caffeine, and cotinine detections confirm prior indications of pharmaceutical and nicotinate disposal in the landfill.

AB Spatial correlation of pollution of the water resource in Taipei, Taiwan, were examined by analyzing the antibiotic resistance patterns (ARPs) of 96 Escherichia coli colonies, which were isolated from 7 sampling sites in 3 river sections. The ARPs were the growth patterns of isolated E. coli colonies in the medium with seven kinds of antibiotics, including ampicillin, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, tetracycline, and salinomycin of different concentrations. The results showed that the survival rate of E. coli decreased with increasing concentration of antibiotics; however, various ARPs under different antibiotics of different concentrations significantly increased both the useful information and complexities. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to analyze the spatial correlations and interrelations of distinct ARPs among sampling sites in this study. It was found that the seven sampling sites can be categorized into three groups which may represent three possible pollution characteristics.

AB This study aimed to investigate the emission and multimedia fate as well as potential risks of triclosan (TCS) in all of 58 basins in China. The results showed that the total usage of TCS in whole China was 100 t/year, and the discharge to the receiving environment was estimated to be 66.1 t/year. The predicted TCS concentrations by the level III fugacity model were within an order of magnitude of the reported measured concentrations. TCS (90.8 %) was discharged into the water compartment and 9.2 % to the soil compartment. The TCS concentration levels in east China were found generally higher than in west China. In addition, the input flux for TCS to seawater was largely attributed to the seasonal variations in advection flows. Preliminary risk assessment showed that medium to high ecological risks for TCS would be expected in the eastern part of China due to the high population density.

AB Naproxen (NPX) is one of the most common pharmaceutical and personal care products found in surface water, which is recalcitrant to degradation by biological treatment or complete removal via traditional sewage treatment processes. In this study, nanoscale gamma-FeOOH was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, surface analysis, and analysis of the forbidden bandwidth. Under UV irradiation, gamma-FeOOH had the capacity to rapidly photodegrade NPX. The photodegradation rate of NPX was dependent on the concentration of gamma-FeOOH in solution, initial NPX concentration, and pH. By increasing the concentration of gamma-FeOOH, the NPX photodegradation rate was increased and then remained stable. Furthermore, the highest photodegradation rate for NPX was observed under acidic conditions. Through the analysis of the active substances (such as h(+), e(-), OH, O-1(2), and O2 center dot-) by electron spin resonance, the photocatalytic mechanism of NPX degradation on gamma-FeOOH was determined to be semiconductor photocatalysis.

AB To comprehensively understand how antibiotics affect anaerobic digestion, their stimulating effects on methane production cannot be ignored; however, few studies have evaluated these effects. This study investigated the stimulating effects of three typical antibiotics (oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine, and norfloxacin) on high solid anaerobic digestion. The results showed that 100 mg/L antibiotics exhibited a strong stimulating effect on CH4 yield; while other external carbon sources had no obvious effects. The stimulating effect was more obvious under low inoculation ratios, which could improve the system processing capacity of feed sludge. Lower lag phases were given by the modified Gompertz model when stimulating effects occurred. The variations of physicochemical parameters and microbial Venn maps both showed that day 5 was a critical point for digestion time. The relative abundance of Methanosarcina was enhanced when the stimulating effect occurred, whereas Methanoculleus decreased. Different microbial characteristics were obtained for different samples from the heat maps.

AB The use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as dipyrone is so widespread that this drug and its metabolites have been detected in effluents and surface water. This study aimed to evaluate the potential toxic effects of dipyrone on the aquatic environment, using a native fish species, Rhamdia quelen. Fish were exposed to three concentrations of dipyrone, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/L, in the water for 15 days, and hematological, biochemical, genetic and morphological biomarkers were evaluated. The glutathione S-transferase activity decreased in the highest concentration in relation to the control group. In addition, hematocrit, red blood cells and thrombocyte counts were decreased in all three exposed groups in relation to the control group. The comet assay showed DNA damage at the lowest concentration of dipyrone and significant kidney damage. Those results suggest that a constant exposure of aquatic organisms to dipyrone presents potential toxic effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The removal performances of nitrogen and trace levels of endocrine-disrupting pesticides (cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos) were studied in the enhanced biofilm pretreatment system at various substrates concentrations and dissolve oxygen (DO) niches. No significant change of EDPs removal occurred with the increased feed of ammonia nitrogen in aerobic batch tests or nitrate in anaerobic batch reactors, but significantly enhanced via reed addition both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Simultaneously enhanced denitrification and EDPs removal were achieved in the anoxic niche with reed addition. The results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) indicated that new bands appeared, and some bands became more intense with the reed addition. Sequences analysis showed that the dominant species belonged to Methylophilaceae, Hyphomicrobium, Bacillus and Thauera, which were related to the nitrogen or EDPs removals. In addition, the growth of functional heterotrophic microbes may be promoted via reed addition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of estrogens in the aquatic environment has become a major concern worldwide because of their strong endocrine disrupting potency. In this study, concentrations of four estrogenic compounds, estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), estriol (E3) were determined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses in surface water from South China Sea, and distributions and potential risks of their estrogenic activity were assessed. The estrogenic compounds El, E2 and E3 were detected in most of the samples, with their concentrations up to 11.16, 3.71 and 21.63 ng L-1. However, EE2 was only detected in 3 samples. Causality analysis, EEQ values from chemical analysis identified E2 as the main responsible compounds. Based on the EEQ values in the surface water, high estrogenic risks were in the coastal water, and low estrogenic risks in the open sea. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Drospirenone (DE) is a fourth-generation progesterone that has been widely used in oral contraceptives for women because of its safety and few side effects in terms of pharmacological activity. A new solvatomorph (crystal form C) of DE with dimethyl sulfoxide was identified and characterized for the first time through a thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) coupling system. The thermodynamic property of the new solvatomorph of DE was different from those of most pharmaceutical solvatomorphs, and it was revealed via the skimmer-type interfaced TGMS system and differential scanning calorimetry. This new solvatomorph and a polymorph of DE obtained without solvent (crystal form A) were well characterized by X-ray crystallography and vibrational spectroscopic analysis. Computational studies based on their single-crystal structures, such as Hirshfeld surface analyses, were used to determine the intermolecular interactions in the crystal network. The single-crystal structure of crystal form C of DE was determined and reported for the first time.

AB Pharmaceutical pollutants have been detected in many countries in surface and ground water after treatment in wastewater treatment plants. The presented studies concern the photocatalytic removal of one of SSRI antide-pressants - sertraline from water using TiO2 photocatalyst. The process was conducted using two laboratory installations with periodic and flow reactors. Two forms of TiO2 was used in the photocatalytic reactions: suspended and supported onto a glass fabric. The studies shown that with increasing initial concentration of pharmaceutical, photoactivity decreases. For the initial concentration of 0.025 g/dm(3), the best results - 94% removal - was achieved for the process conducted in the periodic reactor with TiO2 supported onto a glass fabric.

AB The sediment quality of Cadiz Bay, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (LPGC) Port, Santander Bay, Algeciras Bay, and Huelva Estuary (Spain) was evaluated by analysing a battery of biochemical biomarkersactivities of biotranformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD], dibenzylflourescein dealkylase [DBF], and glutathione S-transferase [GST]; activity of antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase [GR]; and lipid peroxidation [LPO] in the polychaete Arenicola marina after laboratory sediment exposure. Huelva Estuary polychaetes showed significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced LPO, GST, and EROD activities compared with control lugworms related to metals and presumably polychlorinated biphenyls. EROD activity significant (p < 0.05) induction was associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons after Santander Bay sediment exposure. Nickel appeared to significantly (p < 0.05) induce GR activity and LPO in LPGC Port sediment-exposed organisms. DBF activity significantly (p < 0.05) increased in polychaetes exposed to sediments from sewage-contaminated areas. A. marina was sensitive at the biochemical level. Integration of sediment characterization and biomarker results allowed the identification of polluted sites as well as the cause of possible sediment toxicity.

A single couple can produce hundreds or thousands of embryos and hence can be used as a simple high-throughput approach in toxicity studies. In the present study, zebrafish and sea urchin embryo bioassays were used to test the toxicity of four pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes: diclofenac, propranolol, simvastatin and sertraline. Simvastatin was the most toxic tested compound for zebrafish embryo, followed by diclofenac. Sertraline was the most toxic drug to sea urchin embryos, inducing development abnormalities at the ng/L range. Overall, our results highlight the potential of sea urchin embryo bioassay as a promising and sensitive approach for the high-throughput methods to test the toxicity of new chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, and identify several drugs that should go through more detailed toxicity assays.

AB The biodegradation of five pharmaceutical ingredients (PIs) of different therapeutic classes, namely antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfametoxazole and ciprofloxacin), anti-inflammatory (diclofenac) and anti-epileptic (carbamazepine), by two distinct microbial consortia, was investigated. For the monitoring of biodegradation assays, a simple HPLC-DAD (High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Diode Array Detector) method was developed and validated. The separation of the target pharmaceuticals was performed using an environmental friendly mobile phase in a gradient mode of 0.1% triethylamine (TEA) in water acidified at pH 2.23 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) and ethanol as organic solvent. The method revealed to be selective, linear and precise in the range of 1.0 to 30.0 mu g/mL for all PIs. Biodegradation assays were performed using activated sludge and a bacterial consortium (able to degrade fluoroaromatic compounds) supplemented with the target PIs at a final concentration of 25 mu g/mL. The results revealed that activated sludge removed the target compounds more efficiently than the bacterial consortium.

The methods include solid phase extraction (SPE) that acts as a cleanup and concentrates the sample a thousand-fold. The samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using two mass spectrometry techniques, MS/MS to confirm the presence of the pharmaceuticals in the samples and MRM to quantitate. Identification of nine out of ten compounds was found in both the city of Lawrence, KS influent and effluent wastewater samples. Kansas River water showed the presence of seven out of ten compounds and in tap water five out of ten compounds were detected. (C) 2003 American Chemical Society.

AB The astounding increase in the use of pharmaceuticals in the last decade has raised concerns over their occurrence in the soils and wastewaters posing potential dangers to the general public health and environment. Considering the limitations of chemical remediation measures in treatment of recalcitrant xenobiotics, several bioremediation measures are being currently investigated and proposed for removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from the environment. Several bacterial, fungal and plant species have shown promising bioremediation potential with regard to the removal of pharmaceuticals. Varying configurations of anaerobic and aerobic reactors have been utilized for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. This chapter is intended to give a compilation and overview of the various types of bioremediation measures currently being employed or investigated to remove the pharmaceutical pollutants.

AB In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was used to dispose the penicillin sludge (PS). The effects of different reaction conditions on the product and the redistribution and transformation pathway of nitrogen were investigated. The results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil was 37.5% when the temperature of HTL was 340 degrees C and the holding time was 30 min. About 20% of the nitrogen was present in the solid residue obtained by HTL of PS, and the remaining was converted into other phases. The most amino-N in the PS was present in the aqueous phase in the form of Org-N, and the remaining was converted to pyrrole-N, pyridine-N and quaternary-N in the solid residue. The amine-N in the oil phase was also derived from the hydrolysis of the amino nitrogen. As the temperature of the HTL increased, the amine-N formed a heterocycle-n by Diels- Alder reaction.

AB In order to address increased interest from scientists and regulators in quantifying environmental risks associated with release of common down-the-drain consumer products, a single-medium contaminant fate model for the lower St. Lawrence drainage basin in Southern Ontario was developed. The model was built within the pre-existing framework of the iSTREEM (R) in-stream environmental exposure model, which previously only contained US geographies. Data for the model were obtained from Canadian Government sources. In order to assess the model's strengths and limitations, concentrations of the chemicals triclosan and carbamazepine in surface water were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) generated by the model for both mean and low flow scenarios. Results of the PECs and the measured surface water concentrations were comparable, with the surface water concentrations generally falling in between the mean and low flow PECs on a cumulative distribution curve.

AB We report a comparative study on the photodegradation of the widely used benzodiazepine psychoactive drug alprazolam (8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4] triazolo[4,3-a][1,4] benzodiazepine, ALP) using direct photolysis, and titanium dioxide photocatalyzed reaction. Titanium dioxide photocatalysts were prepared as nanoparticles by acidic sol-gel methods, calcined at two different temperatures, and their behavior compared with P25 (Degussa type) TiO2. Efficient photodegradation was observed in the photocatalytic process, with over 90% degradation after 90 minutes under optimized conditions. Triazolaminoquinoline, 5-chloro-(5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) benzophenone, triazolbenzophenone, and a-hydroxyalprazolam were identified as the degradation products by fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC-MS. A comparison with the literature suggests that 8H-alprazolam may also be formed. Good mineralization was observed with TiO2 photocatalysts. ALP photodegradation with TiO2 follows pseudo-first order kinetics, with rates depending on the photocatalyst used. The effects of the quantity of the photocatalyst and concentration of alprazolam were studied.

AB Black light photocatalytic ozonation of two pharmaceutical compounds, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF), and the resulting total organic carbon (TOC) are studied. DCF and SMX removals from some mg.L-1 to 100 mu g.L-1 are achieved in approximately 7 and 15 min ozonation, respectively, regardless of the ozone process, while the resulting TOC is eliminated via hydroxyl radical reactions. For initial concentrations lower than 50 mu g.L-1, competition between direct ozonation and hydroxyl radical oxidation to eliminate SMX and DCF takes place. The initial reaction period for cases of high and low concentration is simulated through fast-moderate and slow gas-liquid second order reaction kinetics, respectively. For high starting concentrations the calculated results suggest the presence of ozone fast reacting intermediates. For low starting concentration, calculated results indicate the importance of hydroxyl radical oxidation and the synergic effect of ozone and photocatalytic oxidation. Kinetic data of TOC ozonation, photocatalytic oxidation, and photocatalytic ozonation are also presented.

AB Pharmaceutical sludge is considered as a hazardous material with high treatment and disposal costs. In the present study, the catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) of pharmaceutical sludge by CuO-CeO2/gamma-Al2O3 as the catalyst was investigated. The catalyst was prepared by traditional wet impregnation. The catalyst was characterized using X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). CWO was performed in an experimental batch reactor. Several parameters that could affect the catalytic degradation efficiency, including catalyst dose, temperature, time, oxygen pressure and pH, were investigated. Under optimum conditions, the highest removal rate of volatile suspended solids (VSS) was 87.3% and was achieved at 260 degrees C for 60 min with an oxygen pressure of 1.0 MPa and 10 g/L of catalyst. At the same time, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate reached as high as 72.6%. This work implies that catalytic wet oxidation is a promising method for the highly efficient degradation of pharmaceutical sludge.

AB This study aims to investigate the performance of anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for removing five polycyclic musks (PCMs), which are common active ingredients of personal care and household cleaning products. A laboratory scale AnMBR system was used in this investigation. Concentrations of the PCMs in both the liquid and biosolids phase were measured to conduct a mass balance analysis and elucidate their fate during AnMBR treatment. The AnMBR was effective for removing PCMs from the aqueous phase by a combination of biotransformation and sorption onto the biosolids. However, biotransformation was observed to be the dominant removal mechanism for all five PCMs. Enantioselective analysis of the PCMs in influent, effluent and biomass samples indicated that there was negligible enantioselectivity in the removal of these PCMs. Accordingly, all enantiomers of these PCMs can be expected to be removed by AnMBR with similar efficiency.

AB The inhibitory effects and biotransformation potential of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) under anoxic (i.e., nitrate reducing) and anaerobic (i.e., sulfate reducing and methanogenic) conditions were investigated. Fermentation and sulfate reduction was inhibited in 10-80 mg/L CIP-amended sulfate-reducing.cultures but recovered with prolonged incubation. Methanogenesis in the mixed culture was significantly inhibited at 80-100 mg CIP/L. No significant decrease of CIP concentration was observed under both sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. However, a low degree of CIP biotransformation was observed in a fed-batch denitrifying culture after a lag time even though the microbial, denitrifying activity was gradually inhibited at 24-40 mg CIP/L. Furthermore, the degradation of CIP was accelerated with a UP reamendment of the denitrifying culture. Two CIP biotransformation products in the denitrifying culture were detected and their proposed chemical structures suggest that the antibiotic quinolone moiety of CIP was intact.

AB In the present study we investigate the fate of citalopram (CIT) at neutral pH using advanced water treatment technologies that include O-3. ClO2 oxidation, UV irradiation and Fenton oxidation. The ozonation resulted in 80% reduction after 30 min treatment. Oxidation with ClO2 removed >90% CIT at a dosage of 0.1 mg L-1. During UV irradiation 85% reduction was achieved after 5 min, while Fenton with addition of 14 mg L-1 (Fe2+) resulted in 90% reduction of CIT. During these treatment experiments transformation products (TPs) were formed from CIT, where five compounds were identified by using high resolution and tandem mass spectrometry. Among these desmethyl-citalopram and citalopram N-oxide have been previously identified as human metabolites, while three are novel and published here for the first time. The three TPs are a hydroxylated dimethylamino-side chain derivative, a butyrolactone derivative and a defluorinated derivative of CIT. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Triclosan and triclocarban are antibacterial agents that are widely used in numerous personal care products. Limited information is available on their environmental behavior in soils and soils land applied with wastewaters and biosolids. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to investigate their adsorption and degradation in soils. Both antibacterial agents adsorbed strongly to the sandy loam and silty clay soils with and without addition of biosolids, with distribution coefficients (K-d) ranging from 178 to 264 L kg(-1) for triclosan and from 763 to 1187 L kg(-1) for triclocarban. Sorption of triclosan decreased with increase in soil pH from 4 to 8, whereas triclocarban sorption showed no effect within the tested pH range. Competitive sorption was observed when triclosan and triclocarban coexisted, but the cosolute effect was concentration dependent. Biosolids amendment increased the sorption of triclosan and triclocarban, likely due to the addition of soil organic matter, but displayed no significant effect on degradation.

AB Assessment of the impact of pharmaceutical residues on living organisms is very complex subject. Apart from taking into account the toxicity of individual compounds also their presence in mixtures should be taken into account. In this work, attempts were made to assess the ecotoxicity of biologically active substances (with 50 % effective concentration (EC50 ) values growing from fluoxetine (EC50 = 4.431 nM) >> gemfibrozil approximate to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol approximate to ketorolac > indomethacin > theophylline approximate to progesterone > naproxen approximate to trypsin > 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid > chloramphenicol > acetylsalicylic acid > ibuprofen > ketoprofen > 19-norethindrone to bezafibrate as the least toxic drug among studied ones) to the ISO standardized Ostracodtoxkit F (TM) bioassay. The Ostracodtoxkit F (TM) was proven to be very sensitive tool with respect to responding to presence of pharmaceuticals. Results of studies justify the statement that more research is needed in field of assessment of chronic exposure to pharmaceuticals and other newly emerging pollutants especially when they are present in complex mixture.

AB Pilot tests as basis for the design, implementation and operation of a future full-scale oxidation plant completing the existing sewage treatment in Linkoping, Sweden, were performed. Using an ozonation step between bio-sedimentation and post-denitrification processes, the primary goal was the removal of the highest priority substances to effluent water levels that will not cause adverse effects in the recipient considering the natural dilution. The study included initial emission screenings, dose control trials, treatment performance studies and eco-toxicity studies. At an ozone dose of 5 mg O-3/L, most substances could be removed. Ecotoxicological tests showed no negative effect for the tested ozone doses. High levels of oxygen into the denitrification could be rapidly reduced in the biology. The number of bacteria in the treated water could be significantly reduced even at relatively low ozone doses. Based on these results, the planning for the full-scale implementation of the treatment system was initiated in 2015.

AB Fifty samples of finished drinking waters (FDWs) from Spain covering 12 million inhabitants were tested for 53 pharmaceuticals pertaining to 12 different Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes. The studied compounds are a combination of most commonly consumed pharmaceuticals with other barely reported in the literature. Five compounds, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and ibuprofen were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in some samples (2 to 15 %), but only ibuprofen and azithromycin could be confirmed when analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with a quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument. Concentration levels of ibuprofen in the positive samples ranged from 12 to 17 ng/L (n = 6) while for azithromycin values from 5 to 9.5 ng/L (n = 3) were found. Ibuprofen fragmentation behaviour in different mass spectrometry instrument configurations (triple quadrupole, quadrupole-ion trap, and quadrupole-Orbitrap) was evaluated.

AB A novel multi-templates molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), using acidic pharmaceuticals mixture (ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), ketoprofen (KEP), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA)) as the template, was prepared for the removal of acidic pharmaceuticals from contaminated water. The sorption behaviors of the MIP including sorption kinetics, isotherms, effect of pH and ionic strength were investigated in detail. The MIP exhibited excellent selectivity affinity toward five acidic pharmaceuticals with higher binding capacity in water compared to non-imprinted polymer (NIP). The pseudo-second-order model well described the adsorption of acidic pharmaceuticals on the MIP. The feasibility of applying MIP for removing acidic pharmaceuticals from contaminated environmental water was demonstrated by comparing the adsorption capacity of acidic pharmaceuticals in spiked lake water to that in deionized water. In addition, the MIP could be used at least fifteenth cycles without obvious loss in adsorption capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research examined the anaerobic degradation of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, metoprolol tartrate, and progesterone by methanogenic bacteria. Using direct sample analysis and respirometric testing, anaerobic degradation was examined with (a) each compound as the sole organic carbon source and (b) each compound at a lower concentration (250 mu g/L) and cellulose serving as the primary organic carbon source. The change in pharmaceutical concentration was determined following 7, 28, 56, and 112 days of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Only acetylsalicylic acid demonstrated significant degradation; the remaining compounds showed a mixture of degradation and abiotic removal mechanisms. Experimental results were compared with BIOWIN, an anaerobic degradation prediction model of the US Environmental Protection Agency. The BIOWIN model predicted anaerobic biodegradability of the compounds in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > ibuprofen > acetaminophen > 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol > progesterone. This corresponded well with the experimental findings which found degradability in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > acetaminophen > ibuprofen. Published by Elsevier BM.

AB Tamiflu (R) (oseltamivir ethylester) is an antiviral agent for the treatment of influenza A and B. The prodrug Tamiflu (R) is converted in the human body to the pharmacologically active metabolite, oseltamivir acid, with a yield of 75%. Oseltamivir acid is indirectly photodegradable and slowly biodegradable in sewage works and sediment/water systems. A previous environmental risk assessment has concluded that there is no bioaccumulation potential of either of the compounds. However, little was known about the ecotoxicity of the metabolite. Ester hydrolysis typically reduces the hydrophobicity and thus the toxicity of a compound. In this case, a zwitterionic, but overall neutral species is formed from the charged parent compound. If the speciation and predicted partitioning into biological membranes is considered, the metabolite may have a relevant contribution to the overall toxicity. These theoretical considerations triggered a study to investigate the toxicity of oseltamivir acid (OA), alone and in binary mixtures with its parent compound oseltamivir ethylester (OE). OE and OA were found to be baseline toxicants in the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri. Their mixture effect lay between predictions for concentration addition and independent action for the mixture ratio excreted in urine and nine additional mixture ratios of OE and OA. In contrast, OE was an order of magnitude more toxic than OA towards algae, with a more pronounced effect when the direct inhibition of photosystem II was used as toxicity endpoint opposed to the 24 h growth rate endpoint. The binary mixtures in this assay yielded experimental mixture effects that agreed with predictions for independent action. This is consistent with the finding that OE exhibits slightly enhanced toxicity, while OA acts as baseline toxicant. Therefore, with respect to mixture classification, the two compounds can be considered as acting according to different modes of toxic action, although there are indications that the difference is a toxicokinetic effect, not a true difference of mechanism of toxicity. The general mixture results illustrate the need to consider the role of metabolites in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. However, in the concentration ratio of parent to metabolite excreted by humans, the experimental results confirm that the active metabolite does not significantly contribute to the risk quotient of the mixture.

AB Effects of copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) on the adsorption of sulfathiazole (STZ) and tylosin (T) to peat and soil were investigated using a batch equilibration method. Results show that Cu suppressed STZ adsorption onto peat and soil at pH < 5.0 because of the electrostatic competition, while increased STZ adsorption at pH > 5.0 due to the formation of STZ Cu complexes and/or Cu bridge. In contrast, Al only decreased STZ adsorption at pH < 6.0, and exerted slight effect on STZ adsorption at >6.0. As for T, both Cu and Al suppressed its adsorption over the entire pH range owing to three reasons: 1) electrostatic competition between Cu/Al and T+; 2) Cu/Al adsorption made the soil and peat surface less negatively charged, which was unfavorable for T+ adsorption; 3) the shrunken pore size of peat and soil retarded the diffusion of large-sized T into these pores.

AB A 5-month "self-serve" pilot project was implemented to properly dispose of old and unwanted prescription and nonprescription medications. Obstacles encountered during the program included reluctance by major drug store chains to participate, regulatory and legal restrictions on pharmaceutical handling, and collection of detailed data from participants. Despite these difficulties, a total weight of 305 lb of discarded pharmaceuticals was collected during the pilot program period from an estimated 500 participants. A survey of participants indicated that discard of pharmaceuticals to the sanitary sewer, a newly discovered environmental hazard, is commonplace, with approximately 50% of participants using this method previously. The average age of the patients using the disposed medication was approximately 64 yr old, with the large majority being above 50 yr in age. The majority of participants learned of the program through newspaper advertisement. The average age or time after purchase, of the medication was approximately 3 yr, and the primary purpose cited for its disposal was that the medication had exceeded its expiration date.

AB Pharmaceuticals enter natural waters through sewage effluent and landfill leachates and present an unknown risk to aquatic species including freshwater invertebrates. In this study the acute and chronic toxicity of 10 drugs, commonly prescribed in the UK i.e. ibuprofen, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, amoxicillin, bendroflumethiazide, furosemide, atenolol, diazepam, digoxin, amlodipine were assessed using the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris. In a 7 day exposure period there were no effects on survival at concentrations up to 1.0 mg l(-1) and after 17 days neither feeding nor bud formation were adversely affected. However the ability of dissected polyps to regenerate a hypostome, tentacles and foot was inhibited by diazepam, digoxin and amlodipine at 10 mug l(-1). It is suggested that other drugs targeted at mammalian receptor systems may also affect aquatic invertebrates although it is unlikely, at their low environmental concentrations, that those examined in this study actually present a risk.

AB This study established two mesophilic anaerobic digesters to ascertain the microbial dynamics and variation characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during sludge anaerobic digestion (AD) with high concentration of antibiotics. System parameters, microbial community, ARGs (tetA, tetM, tetW, sulI, sulII) and integrase gene of class 1 (intI1) were analyzed. General performance of AD showed methane production was inhibited by 17.1% under the pressure of antibiotics. Microbial 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results showed the richness of microbial community decreased, but a higher diversity was found with antibiotics added. Furthermore, microbial community structure at genus level was significantly changed. Real-time quantitative PCR of several target genes demonstrated that the adjunction of high concentration of antibiotics exerted a significant induction influence on ARGs, however, the abundance of intI1 decreased observably. Correlation analysis showed intI1 only played a small role in ARGs' transfer during AD, change of potential hosts was the key factor instead.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is a non-steroidal drug that is classified as a trace organic compound (TrOC). A forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (FOMBR) has traditionally been a favored technology for wastewater treatment. In this study, the IBU degradation mechanism was clarified using an FOMBR. The results indicated that the average removal efficiencies of contaminants were greater than 96.32%. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) results demonstrated that there were 10 intermediates and 5 possible pathways during the IBU degradation. Decarboxylation and hydroxylation may be the primary pathways of IBU degradation. The microbial results illustrated that Proteobacteria was dominant and of utmost importance in the degradation process. Thauera and Azoarcus were the dominant genera that participated in contaminant degradation.

AB A water solution of emerging contaminants (ECs) was treated by advanced oxidation systems. Ozone-based processes led to the highest ECs degradation rates. Regardless of the nature of the aqueous matrix, no differences in EC removal were obtained when O3 was added. Mineralization occurred to some extent when activated carbon (AC) or O3 were present. O3, UVA/TiO2/O2, and UVA/TiO2/O3 processes were applied in runs carried out with low ECs concentration. Single ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation led to the complete ECs degradation in less than 5min. When a secondary effluent was used, the efficiency of the technologies decreased. With the exception of caffeine, a detrimental effect of other organic/inorganic compounds present in secondary effluents was observed.

AB The mechanism of product formation during ozonation of two widely used antimicrobial agents, macrolide roxithromycin and inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) trimethoprim was studied in laboratory-scale experiments with two types of matrix: distilled water and secondary wastewater effluent The structures of the primary and secondary reaction intermediates were elucidated by quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqToF) instrument, showing that in spite of their high ozone affinity both roxithromycin and trimethoprim oxidation pathway involve to a great degree the center dot OH radical chain reactions. In total nine ozonation products were detected, whereas two products of roxithromycin exhibited high refractoriness to ozonation, especially in the case of distilled water. Furthermore, the intact tertiary amine moiety of roxithromycin in these products suggests that the antimicrobial activity of the parent compound will be preserved.

AB The increasing use of pharmaceutical products also increases their release in aquatic environment. These contaminants are considered emerging pollutants, and induce adverse ecological and human health effects. The antidiabetic metformin is one example that has been detected in the aquatic environment at unusual concentrations. This fact indicates that conventional wastewater treatment is inefficient on eliminating this compound. Here we show that metformin can be effectively removed from water by photocatalysis. We found the optimised conditions for pH and concentration of catalyst on the photocatalytic process. TiO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 were successful in oxidising metformin under UV radiation following a pseudo-first order kinetics. Intermediates of metformin photodegradation appeared after photocatalytic treatment. Toxicity analysis showed that the degradation products are non-toxic to Lactuca sativa seeds.

AB Emerging pharmaceutical contaminants have raised severe challenges to remediation technologies for water treatment. In this paper, we report a facile method for preparation of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) using urea as a nitrogen precursor. The prepared metal-free N-rGO is able to efficiently activate persulfate (PS) to produce reactive radicals for degradation of an antibiotic of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP). The effects of reaction parameters on SCP degradation were investigated. The activation processes were studied by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), which discovered the newly observed hydroxyl radicals from PS activation. This study suggests a green remediation for removal of antibiotics in wastewater without producing any heavy metal leaching as the secondary contamination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photocatalytic abatement of hazardous pharmaceuticals has been investigated at very low concentration in the ppb range as found in wastewater and in environmental pollutants. Photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline as a model compound with titania catalysts has been studied using solarium UV-A and black light with differentially applied electric power, tetracycline and catalyst concentration. Abatement of up to 90% has been achieved after 1 hour. Adsorption of tetracycline and photochemical degradation contribute significantly to the abatement of tetracycline resulting in an immediate reduction during the initial period of treatment. Contribution of adsorption is high at very low concentration (500 ppb). Photocatalytic treatment with titania is even highly efficient in the abatement of very small concentrations of tetracycline in drinking water.

AB Pharmaceutical and diagnostic substances like antibiotics, cytostatics and iodised X-ray contrast media (XRC) are well-known for not being metabolised and are excreted soon after application. As a result, these preparations are difficult to biodegrade and their adsorption behaviour is rather poor. Finally, the refractory properties of these substances are leading to an accumulation in the natural waterbody depending on the hydrological, situation. The elimination of contrast media from urine and diluted urine solutions by ozonation was investigated using a bubble column reactor to remove and recover the formed elemental iodine from the solution by gas stripping and down stream absorption. The experiments showed that the destruction of XRCs from concentrated solutions like urine is feasible and a recycling of elemental iodine from the exhaust gas is technically and economically possible.

AB Ibuprofen is commonly detected in onsite wastewater systems. Such onsite systems are abundant in coastal plain areas, globally. Coastal plain soils have unique mineralogy. Rapid subsurface transport may occur in coastal plain soils due to their characteristic permeable soils and seasonally high water tables. Laboratory batch sorption studies were conducted on Norfolk, Goldsboro, and Lynchburg, three archetypical coastal plain soils, with varying physicochemical properties, to evaluate ibuprofen sorption. Sorption distribution coefficients (K (D) values) across all three soils ranged from 0.63 to 1.26 L kg(-1). Sorption of ibuprofen to Norfolk and Goldsboro soils was able to be modeled using a Freundlich isotherm; however, the Lynchburg soil, was not, likely due to soil heterogeneity. In general, sorption of ibuprofen was influenced by soil organic carbon content.

AB Capability of nanofiltration membranes (NF) to remove pharmaceutical active compounds from wastewater streams was investigated. Sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac sodium, hydrochlorothiazide, 4-acetamidoantipyrine, nicotine and ranitinide hydrochloride were selected as model compounds since they are widely produced as pharmaceutical agents. Two commercially available polyamide nanofiltration membranes (NF-90 and NF-270 from Dow FilmTec) were tested. Solute retention by NF-90 membrane was very high in all cases (over 95%), whereas NF-270 retention systematically appeared lower ranging from 75% (nicotine) to 95% (ranitidine hydrochloride). Temporal evolution of flux decline was also investigated. The influence of physicochemical properties of both membrane and solutes on membrane performance was analyzed to explore the main solute-membrane interactions that determine the solute transfer across the membrane. The influence of operation pressure on NF-90 and NF-270 rejection was also studied.

AB Heterogeneous hybrid systems have emerged as effective approaches for decontamination of aqueous solutions containing non-biodegradable compounds. This is the first study employed hexagonal magnesium oxide (MgO) anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as heterogeneous catalyst, in coupling with UV and ultrasound (US) waves (marked as MCs/UV/US) for degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ). MgO/CNT nanocomposites (MCs) were synthesized through an ultrasound-assisted hydrothermal method, and their properties were characterized via BET, FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, EIS, TGA, UV-vis DRS, EDAX, and EDS techniques. The FESEM and TEM results indicated that CNTs were well-incorporated into the hexagonal MgO. The ability of MCs/UV/US system for SDZ decontamination was evaluated as a function of solution pH, catalyst loading, US power, UV intensity, initial SDZ concentration, scavenging agents and co-existing chemicals. As-prepared catalyst showed a significant synergistic effect in the presence of both UV and US irradiation for SDZ mineralization. During sono-photocatalytic process, the complete degradation of SDZ (45 mg/L) was achieved at pH: 11.0; MCs: 0.9 g/L; US power: 200 W; and UV intensity: 150 W within 80 min reaction. MCs exhibited high chemical stability and reusability after six consecutive cycles. However, the addition of co-existing anions, especially Cl-, gradually reduced the efficiency of SDZ degradation over MCs/UV/US system. Trapping studies indicated that hydroxyl radicals and holes were responsible for oxidation of organic chemicals during the reaction period. The plausible pathway and mechanism of sono-photocatalytic decomposition of SDZ were determined in details. Kinetic data confirmed that degradation process was fitted to a pseudo first-order kinetic model with a regression coefficient of 0.98. MCs/UV/US process effectively quenched 89% and 96% of TOC and COD in the pharmaceutical wastewater, respectively. The biodegradability and toxicity of the produced organic chemicals were considerably enhanced after the treatment.

AB A highly sensitive and robust method was developed for routine analysis of two progestin metabolites, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnanolone (17OH-Delta 5P) and pregnanediol (PD), and 31 other natural and synthetic steroids and related metabolites (estrogens, androgens, corticosteroids, progestins) in river water, as well as influents and effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) using HPLC-MS/MS combined with solid-phase extraction. For the various matrixes considered, the optimized method showed satisfactory performance with recoveries of 70-120% for most of target steroids. The method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0.01 to 3 ng/L for river water, 0.02 to 10 ng/L for WWTP effluents, and 0.1 to 40 ng/L for influents with good linearity and reproducibility. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of steroids in rivers and WWTP influent and effluents. WWTP influents concentrations of 17OH-Delta 5P and PD were 51-256ng/L and upto 400ng/L, respectively, along with androstenedione (concentration range: 38-220 ng/L), testosterone (11-26 ng/L), estrone (2.3-37 ng/L), 17 beta-estradiol (N.D.-8.7 ng/L), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (N.D.-66 ng/L), medroxyprogesterone acetate (N.D.-5.3 ng/L), and progesterone (2.0-22 ng/L), while only androstenedione (ADD), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3) were detected in effluent with concentrations ranging up to 1.7 ng/L, 0.90 ng/L and 0.8 ng/L, respectively. In river water samples, only ADD and E1 were detected with concentrations up to 1.0 ng/L and 0.91 ng/L. Our procedure represents the first method for analyzing 17OH-Delta 5P and PD in environmental samples along with a large series of steroids. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drugs in wastewater arise from many sources. For health care, these include excretion and direct disposal (bedside wasting). The present study reports on the dispensing and wasting of 15 controlled substances (CS) at two health care facilities in Albany, NY over a nearly two year period. The study considered measures of ecotoxicity, drug metabolism, excretion and disposal of these CS. Potential alternatives to flushing of CS into wastewaters from healthcare facilities are discussed.
   Drug medication and waste collection records (12,345) included: numbers of drugs dispensed, returned and wasted. Overall, 8528 g of 15 CS were wasted. Three (midazolam, acetaminophen-codeine and fentanyl) accounted for 87.5% of the total wasted. Wasting varied by hospital, 14 CS at the academic medical center hospital and 8 at the surgical care center were wasted. Liquids were more frequently wasted than tablets or pills. Some combination drugs (acetaminophen (APAP)-codeine) were frequently (50% of drug dispensed) wasted while others were less wasted (APAP-hydrocodone-6.3%; APAP-oxycodone-1.3%). The 8 CS judged more hazardous to aquatic life were: APAP-codeine, APAP-hydrocodone, APAP-oxycodone, alprazolam, diazepam, fentanyl, midazolam, and testosterone. Ketamine, morphine, oxycodone and zolpidem were of lesser acute toxicity based on available LC50 values. These CS might provide a therapeutically equivalent alternative to the more environmentally harmful drugs.
   In health care facilities, professionals dispose of CS by bedside wasting into water or other receptacles. This can be avoided by returning CS to the hospital's pharmacy department, thence to a licensed distributor. Study of this process of drug wasting can identify opportunities for process improvements. We found 3 CS (APAP-codeine, midazolam and testosterone) where 1/2 to 1/3 of the drug was wasted and 5 others with 30 to 13% wasted. Knowledge of the adverse impacts from the release of highly toxic drugs into the environment might influence CS selection and disposal alternatives. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river. Water Environ. Res., 85, 13 (2013).

AB In the early 1990s different studies highlighted the relationship between pharmaceuticals, human health and the environment. Among the emerging contaminants, antibiotics are obviously of high concern, because of their potential for inducing antibiotic resistance. In addition, natural and synthetic hormones are relevant because of their potential endocrine-disrupting effects on wildlife. This investigation focuses on the analysis of four classes of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals (sulfonamides. tetracyclines, analgesics and hormones) in surface water and wastewater in Luxembourg. The selected eleven pharmaceuticals include four sulfonamides (sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine), two tetracyclines (tetracycline and oxytetracycline), two analgesics (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and three hormones (2 naturals, estrone and beta-estradiol, and a synthetic one, 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol). The most innovative parts of this study are the simultaneous extraction of the above-mentioned pharmaceuticals as well as tracking their behaviour during flood events in a small river catchment. The method includes pre-concentration by solid phase extraction using Oasis (R) HLB (Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance) which gave superior results compared to Chromabond (R) C-18EC. Chromabond (R) EASY and Bond Elut (R) PLEXA cartridges, also evaluated in this investigation. The analysis of the investigated pharmaceutical compounds is carried out by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The limits of quantification were 1 ng L-1, except for beta-estradiol (2 ng L-1) and 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol (6 ng L-1). Recovery rates range from 70 to 94%, with relative standard deviations between 4 and 19%. Application of this method to river concentration and flood events revealed high concentrations of ibuprofen (10-4000 ng L-1), with highest levels during flood events, while concentrations of estrogens (1-240 ng L-1) and sulfonamides (1-20 ng L-1) were comparatively low.

AB Two representative pharmaceutical activated compounds, Carbamazepine and Naproxen, were removed (removal efficiency of 52.7 and 58.1%, respectively) in six days in a reaction system with the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium immobilized on sawdust. Naproxen's removal was considered mainly due to the biological/fungal removal whereas Carbamazepine's removal relied largely on the sawdust adsorption. The removal of two target compounds was not found directly related to the activities of two extracellular enzymes lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase, but the synthesis of two enzymes was inhibited by the addition of two pharmaceutical compounds at the initial period. The application of sawdust carriers was found conducive to the synthesis of extracellular enzymes even though without a significant improvement in the biomass production.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that alter the function of the endocrine system and consequently cause adverse effects to humans or wildlife. The release of particular EDCs into the environment has been shown to negatively affect certain wildlife populations and has led to restrictions on the use of some EDCs. Current chemical regulations aim to balance the industrial, agricultural and/or pharmaceutical benefits of using these substances with their demonstrated or potential harm to human health or the environment. A summary is provided of the natural science evidence base informing the regulation of chemicals released into the environment that may have endocrine disrupting effects on wildlife. This summary is in a format (a 'restatement') intended to be policy-neutral and accessible to informed, but not expert, policy-makers and stakeholders.

AB We found that acetaminophen could be effectively transformed and removed from water by laccase-mediated oxidative coupling processes. The removal of acetaminophen followed second-order kinetics with first-order to the concentrations of both the substrate and the enzyme. Mass spectrum analysis demonstrated that polymerization through radical-radical coupling mechanism was the pathway leading to acetaminophen transformation. Coupling products thus formed are believed to be biologically inactive and more readily removable from water. Secondary mass spectra of the dimers in combination with molecular modeling analysis further elucidated that the coupling proceeded via covalent bonding between two molecules at their unsubstituted carbons in benzene rings. These findings demonstrated that laccase-mediated oxidative coupling can potentially serve as an alternative strategy to control certain micropollutants in water/wastewater treatment and reuse.

AB Membrane processes, especially reverse osmosis, have played a major role since the early 1990s in the production of high-purity water for power, pharmaceutical, beverage and semi-conductor industries, and will continue to play a critical role in the growth of this water sector to meet ever-increasing demands of water purity, especially in microelectronics applications. Power plants are the single largest user of high-purity water. Membrane processes are also being increasingly used in the reduction of wastewater, water reclamation, recycle and conservation, and environmental pollution control. The production of high-purity water and ultra-pure water for the above-mentioned industries is described in detail. Recent advances, new processes and membrane development such as high performance systems, hot water sanitisation and shrinking line width in microelectronics devices to meet critical requirements are discussed.

AB The adsorption of carbamazepine was evaluated on activated carbon in fixed bed columns. The effect of various parameters on breakthrough curves like carbamazepine initial concentrations (1.2, 1.6, and 2.5mg/L), bed depths (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8cm) and volumetric flow rates (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0mL/min) was investigated. The breakthrough time increased with increase of bed depth, and decreased with increase of initial concentration and volumetric flow rate. In order to predict the theoretical breakthrough curves and to determine model parameters, BDST, Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Clark models were applied to the experimental adsorption processes under the operational conditions described above. The Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB An advanced ozone membrane reactor that uses membranes for ozone distribution, reaction contact and selective water separation was used for ozone treatment of a recalcitrant endocrine disrupting compound in water. Experiments and model calculation were employed to examine the ozonation of phthalate in the new reactor. Experimental results showed that fast ozone mass transfer rate is responsible for membrane reactor's superb performance compared with a semibatch reactor. Selective water removal further enhanced phthalate conversion and TOC removal by concentrating the pollutants in the reaction zone. Clean water was produced by membrane separation. Mathematical model was used to investigate the effect of membranes, reactor design and reaction operation on pollutant conversion and removal. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial and nutrient contamination from anthropogenic sources impacts fresh and marine waters, reducing water quality and restricting recreational and commercial activities. In many cases the source of this contamination is ambiguous, and a tracer or set of tracers linking contamination to source would be valuable. In this work, the effectiveness of utilizing a suite of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) as tracers of bacteria from human septic system effluent is investigated.
   Field sampling was performed at more than 20 locations over approximately 18 months and analyzed for a suite of CECs and fecal coliform bacteria. The sampling locations included seeps and small freshwater discharges to the shoreline. Sites were selected and grouped according to level of impact by septic systems as determined by previous field sampling programs. A subset of selected locations had been positively identified as being impacted by effluent from failing septic systems through dye testing. The CECs were selected based on their predominant use, their frequency of use, and putative fate and transport properties.
   In addition, two rounds of focused sampling were performed at selected sites to characterize shortterm variations in CECs and fecal coliform concentrations, and to evaluate environmental persistence following source correction activities.
   The results indicate that a suite of common use compounds are suitable as generalized tracers of bacterial contamination from septic systems and that fate and transport properties are important in tracer selection. Highly recalcitrant or highly labile compounds likely follow different loss profiles in the subsurface compared to fecal bacteria and are not suitable tracers. The use of more than one tracer compound is recommended due to source variability of septic systems and to account for variations in the subsurface condition. In addition, concentrations of some CECs were measured in receiving waters at levels which suggested the potential for environmental harm, indicating that the possible risk presented from these sources warrants further investigation.

AB To inform future monitoring and assessment of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in coastal urban watersheds, the occurrence and fate of more than 60 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), commercial/household chemicals, current-use pesticides, and hormones were characterized in 2 effluent-dominated rivers in southern California (USA). Water samples were collected during 2 low-flow events at locations above and below the discharge points of water reclamation plants (WRPs) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Approximately 50% of targeted CECs were detectable at stations downstream from WRPs, compared with <31% and <10% at the reference stations above the WRPs. Concentrations of chlorinated phosphate flame retardants were highest among the CECs tested, with mean total aggregate concentrations of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) of 3400ng/L and 2400ng/L for the 2 rivers. Maximum in-stream concentrations of pyrethroids (bifenthrin and permethrin), diclofenac, and galaxolide exceeded risk-based thresholds established for monitoring of CECs in effluent-dominated receiving waters. In contrast, maximum concentrations of PPCPs commonly detected in treated wastewater (e.g., acetaminophen, N,N,diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and gemfibrozil) were less than 10% of established thresholds. Attenuation of target CECs was not observed downstream of WRP discharge until dilution by seawater occurred in the tidal zone, partly because of the short hydraulic residence times in these highly channelized systems (<3 d). In addition to confirming CECs for future in-stream monitoring, these results suggest that conservative mass transport is an important boundary condition for assessment of the input, fate, and effects of CECs in estuaries at the bottom of these watersheds.

AB Incomplete elimination of bacteria and pharmaceutical drugs during wastewater treatment results in the entry of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria into receiving streams with effluent inputs In Mud Creek in Fayetteville AR, ofloxacin trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have been detected in water and sediment and tetracycline has been detected in sediment downstream of treated effluent input. These antibiotics have been measured repeatedly but at low concentrations (<1 mu g/L) in the stream To determine if effluent input results in detectable and stable changes in antibiotic resistances downstream of effluent input antibiotic resistance in Escherichia colt and total coliform bacteria in Mud Creek stream water and sediment were determined using a culture-based method Isolated E. cob colonies were characterized for multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) patterns on solid media and to evaluate E cob isolate richness by amplification of a partial uidA gene followed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) Despite temporal variability, proportions of antibiotic-resistant E. coli were generally high in effluent and 640 m downstream The MAR pattern ampicillin-trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a DGGE profile that was detected in effluent and downstream E colt isolates but not upstream Percent resistance among coliform bacteria to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was higher 640 m downstream compared to upstream sediment and water (with one exception) Resistance to ofloxacin was too low to analyze statistically and tetracycline resistance was fairly constant across sites Resistances changed from 640 m to 2000 m downstream although dissolved nutrient concentrations within that stream stretch resembled effluent Antibiotic resistant bacteria are entering the stream but resistances change within a short distance of effluent inputs more quickly than indicated based on chemical water properties Results illustrate the difficulty in tracking the input and fate of antibiotic resistance and in relating the presence of low antibiotic concentrations to selection or persistence of antibiotic resistances (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB The removal efficiency for 220 micropollutants was studied at the scale of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) upgraded with post-ozonation followed by sand filtration. During post-ozonation, compounds with activated aromatic moieties, amino functions, or double bonds such as sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, or carbamazepine with second-order rate constants for the reaction with ozone >10(4) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 (fastreacting) were eliminated to concentrations below the detection limit for an ozone dose of 0.47 g O(3) g(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Compounds more resistant to oxidation by ozone such as atenolol and benzotriazole were increasingly eliminated with increasing ozone doses, resulting in >85% removal for a medium ozone dose (similar to 0.6 g O(3) g(-1) DOC). Only a few micropollutants such as some X-ray contrast media and triazine herbicides with second-order rate constants <10(2) M(-1) s(-1) (slowly reacting) persisted to a large extent. With a medium ozone dose, only 11 micropollutants of 55 detected in the secondary effluent were found at > 100 ng L(-1). The combination of reaction kinetics and reactor hydraulics, based on laboratory and full-scale date, enabled a quantification of the results by model calculations. This conceptual approach allows a direct upscaling from laboratory- to full-scale systems and can be applied to other similar systems. The carcinogenic by-products N-nitrosodimethylamine (NOMA),(<= 14 ng L(-1)) and bromate (<10 mu g L(-1)) were produced during ozonation, however their concentrations were below or in the range of the drinking water standards. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that biological sand filtration is an efficient additional barrier for the elimination of biodegradable compounds formed during ozonation such as NOMA. The energy requirement for the additional post-ozonation step is about 0.035 kWh m(-3), which corresponds to 12% of a typical medium-sized nutrient removal plant (5 g DOC m(-3)).

AB Antibiotics that are widely used in human and veterinary medicine, over the past few years, antibiotics have been considered emerging pollutants due to their continuous input and persistence in the aquatic ecosystem even at low concentrations. Antibiotics as pollutants are detected nowadays in wastewater and surface water. They are carried with animal excreta and liquid manure into streams. Two extraction methods have been studied for detection of antibiotics in human urine using several solvents. The antibacterial and antifungal potentialities of the urine samples extract were determined against yeasts, bacteria and molds studied. The extracted residue was analyzed for antibiotic present using ultraviolet UV, Infrared IR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR, Mass spectra and C-13. This work provided a preliminary investigation of Erythromycin aglycone which is not known in nature, but its presence by hydrolysis were detected in human urine samples.

AB The chiral signature of the antidepressant venlafaxine was used in this study to gain insight into biological attenuation processes and to differentiate abiotic and biotic transformation processes in water. Laboratory scale experiments revealed that sorption and phototransformation processes were not enantioselective while venlafaxine was enantioselectively biotransformed into O-desmethylvenlafaxine. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) variations of venlafaxine appeared to be proportional to its microbial fractional conversion. Enantioselective biotransformation of venlafaxine was also investigated in a eutrophic French river. Venlafaxine was found to be racemic at the output of the main wastewater treatment plant discharging into the river, independently of the sampling date during the year. An analysis of EF variations might provide evidence of biodegradation along a 30 km river stretch. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Applying non-target analysis (NTA) in regulatory environmental monitoring remains challenging-instead of having exploratory questions, regulators usually already have specific questions related to environmental protection aims. Additionally, data analysis can seem overwhelming because of the large data volumes and many steps required. This work aimed to establish an open in silico workflow to identify environmental chemical unknowns via retrospective NTA within the scope of a pre-existing Swiss environmental monitoring campaign focusing on industrial chemicals. The research question addressed immediate regulatory priorities: identify pollutants with industrial point sources occurring at the highest intensities over two time points. Samples from 22 wastewater treatment plants obtained in 2018 and measured using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry were retrospectively analysed by (i) performing peak-picking to identify masses of interest; (ii) prescreening and quality-controlling spectra, and (iii) tentatively identifying priority "known unknown" pollutants by leveraging environmentally relevant chemical information provided by Swiss, Swedish, EU-wide, and American regulators. This regulator-supplied information was incorporated into MetFrag, an in silico identification tool replete with "post-relaunch" features used here. This study's unique regulatory context posed challenges in data quality and volume that were directly addressed with the prescreening, quality control, and identification workflow developed. Results One confirmed and 21 tentative identifications were achieved, suggesting the presence of compounds as diverse as manufacturing reagents, adhesives, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals in the samples. More importantly, an in-depth interpretation of the results in the context of environmental regulation and actionable next steps are discussed. The prescreening and quality control workflow is openly accessible within the R package Shinyscreen, and adaptable to any (retrospective) analysis requiring automated quality control of mass spectra and non-target identification, with potential applications in environmental and metabolomics analyses. Conclusions NTA in regulatory monitoring is critical for environmental protection, but bottlenecks in data analysis and results interpretation remain. The prescreening and quality control workflow, and interpretation work performed here are crucial steps towards scaling up NTA for environmental monitoring.

AB The high chemical stability and the low biodegradability of a vast number of micropollutants (MPs) impede their correct treatment in urban wastewater treatment plants. In most cases, the chemical oxidation is the only way to abate them. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been experimentally proved as efficient in the removal of different micropollutants at lab-scale. However, there is not enough information about their application at fullscale. This manuscript reports the application of three different AOPs based on the addition of homogeneous oxidants [hydrogen peroxide, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate anions (PS)1, in the UV-C tertiary treatment of Estiviel wastewater treatment plant (Toledo, Spain) previously designed and installed in the facility for disinfection.
   AOPs based on the photolytic decomposition of oxidants have been demonstrated as more efficient than UV-C radiation alone on the removal of 25 different MPs using low dosages (0.05-0.5 mM) and very low UV-C contact time (4-18 s). Photolysis of PMS and H2O2 reached similar average MPs removal in all the range of oxidant dosages, obtaining the highest efficiency with 0.5 mM and 18 s of contact time (48 and 55% respectively). Nevertheless, PMS/UV-C reached slightly higher removal than H2O2/UV-C at low dosages. So, these treatments are selective to degrade the target compounds, obtaining different removal efficiencies for each compound regarding the oxidizing agent, dosages and UV-C contact time.
   In all the cases, H2O2/UV-C is more efficient than PMS/UV-C, comparing the ratio cost:efficienc-y (/m(3). order). Even H2O2, UV-C treatments are more efficient than UV-C alone. Thus, the addition of 0.5 mM of H2O2 compensates the increased of UV-C contact time and therefore the increase of electrical consumption, that it should be need to increase the removal of MPs by UV-C treatments alone.

AB A synergistic hybrid of two treatment processes, managed aquifer recharge (MAR) combined with ozonation, was proposed for wastewater reclamation and water reuse applications. Batch reactor and soil-column experiments were performed to evaluate reclaimed water quality using various chemical and bacterial analyses. The ozone process was optimized at low ozone dose (0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC) based on the control of N-nitrosodimethylamine (< 5 ng L-1) and bromate (< 10 mu g L-1), and applied prior to (i.e., O-3-MAR) and after MAR (i.e., MAR-O-3). This work demonstrates that effluent organic matter (EfOM) and trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) are effectively removed during the hybrid process of MAR combined ozonation, compared to MAR only. Based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrices analyses, both MAR and ozonation reduce soluble microbial (protein-like) products while only ozonation contributes in reducing humic and fulvic substances. Even at low ozone dose of 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC, the O-3-MAR hybrid significantly reduced UV absorbance by a parts per thousand yen2 m(-1), BDOC by a parts per thousand yen64 %, and total (I ) pound TOrC concentrations by a parts per thousand yen70 % in the effluent water quality. However, no significant improvement (< 10 %) in the removal of I 16 pound TOrC concentrations was observed for the increased ozone dose at 1.0 mg O-3/mg DOC during MAR combined ozonation processes. Overall, O-3-MAR was effective by 10-30 % in treating effluent water than MAR based on DOC, UV254 nm EfOM, TOrC and bacterial analyses. In addition, MAR-O-3 was better than O-3-MAR for the reduction of fluorescence (close MQ), TOrCs (a parts per thousand yen74 %) and total bacteria cell concentrations (> 3 log reduction). Therefore, implementing MAR prior to ozonation appears to remove the bio-amenable compounds that react rapidly with ozone, thereby reducing oxidant demand and treatment efficiency.

AB The results of a characterisation study of water samples collected from an Advanced Water Recycling Plant (AWRP) operating in Perth, Western Australia are presented. The AWRP treats secondary wastewater by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) to produce recycled water for groundwater replenishment. Water samples collected after RO and UV treatment were characterised by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, using an established protocol for target screening. The target screening of 291 compounds detected a total of 13 chemicals in post-RO and post-UV water, including 2 corrosion inhibitors (4+5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, benzotriazole), 3 pesticides (metolachlor, propiconazol, prosulfocarb), 3 pharmaceuticals (lamotrigin, metformin, tramadol), 1 personal care product (galaxalidone), 3 artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame, sucralose) and 1 flame retardant (triethyl phosphate). The corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and 4+5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole, and the pharmaceutical metformin were detected in hundreds of ng L-1, while the other compounds were present in low ng L-1 concentrations. Analysis of UV treated water samples showed that UV treatment also helped to reduced UV degradable compounds such as the corrosion inhibitors (>50% removal), triethyl phosphate (similar to 50% removal) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (similar to 95% removal). Overall, the detection of 13 chemicals through target screening analyses did not account for the residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in post RO water, the majority of which is still an intriguing unknown. However, the target screening did show that there were no obvious "known" anthropogenic contaminants contributing to the majority of the DOC in post-RO and post-UV treated water. Calculated risk quotients (RQ) for all detected chemicals in UV treated water were 2 to 6 order of magnitude below 1, implying an high degree of safety associated with human consumption of recycled water. Overall the chemicals screening provided further evidence of the overall safety of the use of recycled wastewater treated by RO and UV as a potable water source.

AB Isotherms were determined for the adsorption of five pharmaceutical residues, primidone, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac, to Calgon Filtrasorb 300 powdered activated carbon (PAC). The sorption behavior was examined in ultra-pure and wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) matrices, where more sorption was observed in the ultra-pure water for PAC doses greater than 10 mg/L suggesting the presence of EfOM hinders the sorption of the pharmaceuticals to the PAC. Adsorption behaviors were described by the Freundlich isotherm model. Quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) in the form of polyparameter linear solvation energy relationships were developed for simulating the Freundlich adsorption capacity in both ultra-pure and EfOM matrices. The significant 3D-based descriptors for the QSPRs were the molar volume, polarizability and hydrogen-bond donor parameters.

AB Five bacterial strains recovered from deep-sea hydrothermal vents were studied for their ability to secrete extracellular polymers. A preliminary characterization displayed four different polysaccharides in terms of both chemical composition and rheological properties. One of them was secreted by Alteromonas macleodii subsp. fijiensis and exhibited similarities with xanthan, a commercial polysaccharide. Two of the three Pseudoalteromonas species were shown to produce the same polymer. The last polymer was secreted by a bacterium belonging to the Vibrio genus. They all contained glucose, galactose, mannose, glucuronic and galacturonic acids as the main sugars with the exception of the last one which was only constituted by uronic acids and hexosamines, in that similar to the structure of heparin, a glycosaminoglycan useful in pharmaceutical area. Applications for these polysaccharides could be expected in various biotechnological fields including the food industry, the wastewater treatment and pharmaceutical areas.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of 48 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in wastewater effluents from three Slovenian and three Croatian waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) representing the major inputs into the upper and middle course of the Sava River and simultaneously in the Sava River itself. Two sampling campaigns were carried out (May and July 2017). Samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analysed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. In effluents, 23 CECs were >NLOQ with caffeine and the UV-filter 4-hydroxybenzophenone (H-BP) present in the highest concentrations (<49,600 ng L-1 and <28,900 ng L-1, respectively) and most frequently detected (detection frequency; DFr > 83.3%). Bisphenol B and E were detected for the first time in WW from Velika Gorica (May) and Zapresic (July), respectively. In surface water (SW), 19 CECs were detected >NLOQ with CAF again being the most abundant and most frequently detected (DFr = 92.9%). Bisphenols AP, CL2, P and Z were detected>LOQ for the first time in European SW. Active pharmaceutical ingredients naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac; the preservative methyl paraben; CAF and UV-filter HM-BP were the most abundant CECs in SW and WW. An increasing trend in the total CEC load downstream was observed, indicating the cumulative effects of individual sources along the river. The Croatian Zapresic, Zagreb and Velika Gorica WWTP effluents contributed the most towards the enhanced loads of the CECs studied probably due to their size or insufficient treatment. HM-BP was the only compound found at a levels exhibiting high environmental risk (RQ = 1.13) downstream from Ljubljana and Domzale-Kamnik WWTPs. Other SW samples that contained HM-BP, ibuprofen (API) and/or benzyl paraben (preservative) posed a medium risk to the environment. The results suggest the need for further monitoring of CECs in the Sava River Basin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Refractory organics in industrial wastewater are difficult to treat and pose a serious threat to the environment. Upflow anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and internal circulation (IC) reactors are most widely used in the world due to high efficiency, but the inside process remains unknown like a black box. In this study, spatial mass transfer conditions of a pilot-scale UASB reactor, being decomposed as the bottom, middle and top zones, treating pharmaceutical wastewater at organic loading rates (OLR) of 4.32-8.30 kg COD/(m(3).d) were investigated. In addition, the roles of external and internal factors such as organic loading rate and granule properties including size, density, porosity and permeability on mass transfer were investigated for the first time. The average molecular diffusion rates (F-MD) of reactor were 7.43 x 10(-8),1.4 x 10(-7), 2.0 x 10(-7) and 2.73 x 10(-7) mg/s respectively, while, average convective diffusion rates (F-CD) were 5.39 x 10(-1), 1.09, 1.32 and 1.42 mg/s at OLRs of 4.32, 5.70, 6.92 and 8.30 kg COD/(m(3).d) respectively. Interestingly, mass transfer rates increased with the increase of OLR and decreased with a height of the reactor, also, it is directly dependent on granule size. The novel results reveal that the bottom zone is of the fastest mass transfer as compared to middle and top zones of the reactor; furthermore, it is the main degradation zone due to not only high mass transfer but also low feed/sludge and high granule level. The performance of upflow reactors could be enhanced for higher biogas production by installation of biofilm zone in the top zone to replace granules of that zone. The results could facilitate understanding bioprocess in upflow reactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, especially antibiotics has attracted increased interest among scientists. To evaluate the fate of trimethoprim in the aquatic environment, biodegradation as biotic process was investigated in the effluent wastewater. In this experiment, it was found that trimethoprim is not biodegradable. In addition to biotic process, two abiotic processes were also studied. Hydrolytic degradation at pH-values normally found in the environment also showed trimethoprim persistence in the environment with a long half-life. In comparison to both mentioned processes, photolysis proved to he process that could lead to trimethoprim concentrations decrease. HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed two new phototransformation products which structures were suggested on the obtained mass spectrum.
   The obtained results are very important for assessing the environmental fate of trimethoprim in the aquatic environment.

The results shown that the both types of TiO2 (named VLP 7500 and PC 500) used in the experiments can be employed as photocatalytic materials for the elimination of clofibric acid from wastewater but under the same experimental conditions, ZnO proved to have a higher catalytic activity. The effects of some parameters such as catalytic material concentration, initial pollutant concentration was studied. In order to evaluate degradation rate of CA, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used. Morphology and structure of catalytic materials were investigated by using scanning electron microcopy (SEM).

AB This study investigates the occurrence and distribution of 185 organic contaminants (regulated pollutants and contaminants of emerging concern; CECs) in surface and groundwater of the Guadalhorce River basin (southern Spain) providing the most detailed dataset regarding organic pollution presented so far in this area. Up to 63 contaminants were detected in a monitoring campaign conducted in March 2016. Most contaminants were detected more frequently in surface water where they generally present higher concentrations suggesting the prevalence of wastewater discharges into streams as the main pollutant sources. In general, hydrophobic CECs presented the highest frequencies of detection and concentrations, which can be a consequence of several factors: (1) hydrophobic compounds show a higher retardation factor, which result, along with a continuous contaminant input, in a widespread and homogeneous distribution. In contrast, hydrophilic contaminants are more easily transported by water flows towards the lower basin and potentially accumulate as driven by groundwater flow and because of low renewal rates in the detrital aquifers caused by re-pumping and irrigation return flows in agricultural lands; (2) hydrophobic CECs studied in this research are mainly personal care products and organophosphate esters flame retardants and plasticizers, which are present in many different products and are used in large amounts; Also, (3) use of biosolids (reclaimed sewer sludge) as fertilizer for crops is potentially an additional diffuse source of organic pollutants in the study area contributing to a widespread distribution, especially for hydrophobic compounds. Obtained results highlight the need to better define the potential risk of non-regulated contaminants in water resources as well as the great impact of untreated wastewater discharges.

AB The integrated forward osmosis membrane bioreactor and membrane distillation (OMBR-MD) is an emerging technique for wastewater reclamation and trace organic compound (TrOC) removal. The selection of draw solution (DS) for this system should consider the particularities of both forward osmosis and membrane distillation. The effect of five different draw solutions on forward osmosis and TrOC rejection in a hybrid submerged forward osmosis - membrane distillation (FO-MD) module was investigated in this study. The roles of each solution on FO and MD water flux, FO reverse salt flux, temperature, concentration polarization and rejection of 7 TrOCs were explored. The salt used in the draw solution influenced both FO water flux (NaCl = MgOAc2 (4.8 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > NaOAc (4.6 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > MgCl2 (3.6 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > EDTA-Na-2 (2.8 L.m(-2).h(-1))) and MD water flux (NaOAc (4.0 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > NaCl (3.8 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > MgCl2 (3.3 L.m(-2).h(-1)) > MgOAc2 (3.1 L.m(-2).h(-1) > EDTA-Na-2 (3.0 L.m(-2).h(-1))). MgCl2 draw solution produced the lowest FO reverse salt flux, demonstrating its potential to prevent salinity build-up when applied in OMBR-MD. MgCl2 and NaCl were the only salts completely rejected by the distillation membrane, which salt losses during draw solution reconcentration. Regardless of the draw solution salt, the integrated FO-MD module could effectively remove 6 of the 7 TrOCs. MgCl2 and NaOAc afforded the highest TrOC rejections, while the lowest rejections were observed when MgAOc(2) was used. MgCl2 was selected as the best DS salt for OMBR-MD by using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) tool.

AB TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation of a mixture of four pharmaceutical emerging contaminants (ECs): caffeine, flumequine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine, has been studied both in ultrapure and municipal wastewater with the main aim of checking the direct and indirect transfer mechanism of this process. Also, given the high importance of knowing the volumetric rate of photon absorption (VRPA) for the kinetics of the process, actinometrical results have been compared to those from the six flux model (SFM) application. Finally, kinetic equations derived from the direct and indirect transfer mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation have been deduced to fit experimental results and conclude about the possible removal way of ECs in water when this advanced oxidation process is applied.

AB Optimization of photocatalytic degradation of phenazopyridine (PhP) under UV light irradiation using immobilized TiO2 nanoparticles was studied. The effect of operational parameters was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum removal efficiency was achieved at the optimum conditions: initial drug concentration of 10 mg/L, UV light intensity of 47 W/m(2), flow rate of 200 mL/min, and reaction time of 150 min. The residence time distribution (RTD) analysis was studied to find the effect of flow rate on the drug removal efficiency. The tracer (PhP) pulse injection response was studied with UV-vis measurements and was used to prepare RTD curves. (c) 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

COSMO-RS model was used for the prediction of selectivity of these compounds in aqueous medium at infinite dilution. Initial benchmarking studies were done by comparing experimental logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficient values (log K-ow) with COSMO-RS predicted data on 13 poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) similar in structure to that of PCP and DDT. 1015 possible ILs were then used to determine the best extractant for the removal of these two EDCs from aqueous solution.

AB Illicit drug abuse presents pervasive adverse consequences for human societies around the world. Illicit drug consumption also plays an unexpected role in contamination of aquatic ecosystems that receive wastewater discharges. Here, we show that methamphetamine, considered as one of the most important global health threats, causes addiction and behavior alteration of brown trout Salmo trutta at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g l(-1)). Altered movement behavior and preference for methamphetamine during withdrawal were linked to drug residues in fish brain tissues and accompanied by brain metabolome changes. Our results suggest that emission of illicit drugs into freshwater ecosystems causes addiction in fish and modifies habitat preferences with unexpected adverse consequences of relevance at the individual and population levels. As such, our study identifies transmission of human societal problems to aquatic ecosystems.

Some of the organic pollutants occur from soap and detergents, petroleum products, dye and textile industries, drugs and pharmaceuticals, herbicide and pesticide and many more. There are numerous technologies available for the treatment of organics that may include the physical, chemical, photocatalytic and microbial processes. The hydrogels offers eco-friendly substrates that have been investigated for decontamination of organics. There are varieties of hydrogels available for different application in pristine forms as well as synthetic forms. Among these, biopolymers that have been categorized as hydrogels and were used for treating organic pollutants have been discussed in this chapter.

AB Engineered nanomaterials, like graphene with tunable adsorption sites and nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) with unique redox chemistry, offer great prospects for removing pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) through adsorption and catalytic advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in comparison to bulk materials. Although PPCPs are found as a complex mixture in wastewater and in the environment, most studies regarding nano-enabled PPCP removal reported results with only one PPCP at a time and typically at high initial concentrations. In this study, we utilized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a support for nZVI to synthesize rGO-nZVI nanohybrids (NHs) and used rGO-nZVI NHs for the removal of a complex mixture of 12 diverse PPCPs that includes antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-seizure, and antidepressant pharmaceuticals, which are recalcitrant in the environment. We also tested the removal of PPCPs at their individual environmentally relevant concentrations at the ppb level. The rGO-nZVI NH was synergistically utilized as both an adsorbent and a heterogeneous Fenton catalyst (for AOPs) in the presence of H(2)O(2)to remove similar to 95-99% of environmentally relevant concentrations (200 ppb) of PPCPs within 10 minutes. Even in the absence of H2O2, the hybridization resulted in better adsorptive properties (14-72% more removal) of the rGO-nZVI NHs compared to the parent nanomaterials (rGO or nZVI) for various PPCPs in the mixture, removing similar to 82-99% of PPCPs, at the end of 30 minutes, with comparatively slower kinetics (similar to 3-5.5 times) than in the presence of H2O2. Hydrophobic PPCPs were removed faster and more PPCPs were removed by both adsorption and AOPs. The potential of utilizing rGO-nZVI NHs in drinking/wastewater treatment systems, or even in point-of-use systems where necessary, was substantiated by the enhanced and fast PPCP removal capacity of nanohybrids.

AB The Prut River, the second longest tributary of the Danube river, was investigated for a wide range of anthropogenic organic pollutants to fill the data gap on environmental contamination in eastern European surface waters. In this study, the occurrence of a wide range of organic pollutants was measured along the transboundary Prut River, between Sculeni and Branza in 2010-2012. Using two different analytical methods, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, over 300 compounds were screened for and 88 compounds were determined in the Prut River. In general, the chemicals occurred at low levels. At the last sampling site upstream of the confluence with the Danube river at Branza, the highest average concentrations (>= 100 ng L-1) were determined for the artificial sweetener acesulfame, the pharmaceuticals metformin, 4-acetamidoantipyrene, and 4,4,5,8-tetramethylchroman-2-ol, the antioxidants 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisol, and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-toluene, the personal care products HHCB (galaxolide), 4-phenyl-benzophenone, and octyl dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid, the industrial chemical diphenylsulfone, and the sterol cholesterol. Low concentrations of agricultural pesticides occurred in the catchment. At Branza, the total accumulated load of all measured compounds was calculated to be almost 19 kg day(-1). In comparison to the Rhine River, the loads in the Prut, determined with same LC-HRMS method for the same set of analytes, were two orders of magnitude lower. Discharge of wastewater without proper treatment from the city of Iasi in the Jijia catchment (Romania) as well as from the city of Cahul (Moldova) revealed a distinct increase in concentrations and loads in the Prut at Frasinesti and Branza. Thus, an implementation of wastewater treatment capacities in the Prut River basin would considerably reduce the loads of micropollutants from urban point sources.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals and their potential for adverse biological effects raise concern for aquatic ecosystem health in protected areas. During 2013-15, surface waters of four Midwestern United States national parks were sampled and analyzed for wastewater indicators, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides. More chemicals and higher concentrations were detected at the two parks with greater urban influences (Mississippi National River and Recreation Area and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore) than at the two more remote parks (Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and Isle Royale National Park). Atrazine (10-15 ng/L) and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (16-120 ng/L) were the only chemicals detected in inland lakes of a remote island national park (Isle Royale National Park). Bisphenol A and organophosphate flame retardants were commonly detected at the other sampled parks. Gabapentin and simazine had the highest observed concentrations (>1000 ng/L) in three and two samples, respectively. At the two parks with urban influences, metolachlor and simazine concentrations were similar to those reported for other major urban rivers in the United States. Environmental concentrations of detected chemicals were often orders of magnitude less than standards or reference values with three exceptions: (1) hydrochlorothiazide exceeded a human health-based screening value in seven samples, (2) estrone exceeded a predicted critical environmental concentration for fish pharmacological effects in one sample, and (3) simazine was approaching the 4000 ng/L Maximum Contaminant Level in one sample even though this concentration is not expected to reflect peak pesticide use. Although few environmental concentrations were approaching or exceeded standards or reference values, concentrations were often in ranges reported to elicit effects in aquatic biota. Data from this study will assist in establishing a baseline for chemicals of concern in Midwestern national parks and highlight the need to better understand the sources, pathways, and potential adverse effects to aquatic systems in national parks.

AB It has been known today that the increase in medicine consumption has been causing certain environmental and economic problems. To solve these problems, it is useful to know the amount of waste medicine generation and the volunteerism of users in removing waste medicines.
   In this study, habits of people living in Istanbul relating to the use of medicine and pharmaceutical waste generation and their willingness to the efforts aiming reducing pharmaceutical waste, which might accordingly be generated, as soon as it has emerged. As a result of the survey, drug usage was determined to be 6.14 boxes per year per person, while unused drugs were found to be very high at an annual average of 5.40 boxes. 60% of unused medicines were discarded while 24% of these were stored at home and only 7.7% were returned to pharmacies.

AB Recalcitrant compounds in pharmaceutical wastewaters render biological treatment inadequate. Conventional Fenton technology, though a promising alternative, suffers from high sludge generation. In this study, fluidized-bed (FB) Fenton process, an improvement of traditional Fenton method, was used to decompose acetaminophen (ACT) from aqueous solutions. Optimization of important parameters: initial pH, ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide dosages, was carried out using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). Effects of all factors and their interactions on ACT decomposition were significant. At optimum operating conditions, ACT degradation reached 97.8% while iron removal of 62.92% was achieved. In addition, the high hydrogen peroxide efficiencies of FB-Fenton process with respect to ACT degradation and COD removal make this technology a cost-effective option in treating acetaminophen-contaminated wastewaters.

AB In this study, hydrogen production was analyzed along with methane and carbon dioxide generation using paroxetine, venlafaxine, and o-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) as substrates in single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Combinations of all three drugs were examined at concentrations of 750 ng/mL and 170 ng/mL. At the beginning of MEC operations using a 750 ng/mL mixture of drugs, there was no hydrogen or methane, but carbon dioxide was detected. When the concentration of the drug mixture was reduced to 170 ng/mL, MECs produced hydrogen and methane gas. Removal of the drugs during MEC operations was also analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Paroxetine, venlafaxine and ODV drugs were removed up to 99% by MECs. In conclusion, MECs could offer an alternative treatment method for wastewaters containing psychoactive pharmaceuticals with the added benefit of fuel hydrogen generation.

AB Widespread use of pharmaceuticals and suboptimal wastewater treatment have led to increased levels of these substances in aquatic ecosystems. Lipid-lowering drugs such as gemfibrozil, which are among the most abundant human pharmaceuticals in the environment, may have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms. We examined the genotoxicity of gemfibrozil in a fish species, the gilthead seabream (Sparta aurata), which is commercially important in southern Europe. Following 96-h waterborne exposure, molecular (erythrocyte DNA strand breaks) and cytogenetic (micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities in cells) endpoints were measured. Gemfibrozil was positive in both endpoints, at environmentally relevant concentrations, a result that raises concerns about the potential genotoxic effects of the drug in recipient waters.

AB This study investigates the electrochemical oxidation of caffeine under various operating parameters (current density, initial caffeine concentration, electrode material (BDD, PbO2, and Pt), and sample matrix). According to cyclic voltammetric analysis, the oxidation of caffeine on BDD was found to be electrochemically irreversible. The degradation efficiency of caffeine increased with increasing current density but noticeably decreased as initial caffeine concentration increased. Superior to the PbO2 and Pt electrodes for caffeine degradation and total organic carbon abatement, the BDD anode exhibited the highest maximum value of caffeine mineralization current efficiency. At 200 mA/cm(2) and 25 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of caffeine oxidation were 7.6 x10(-4) and 6.9x10(-4) 1/s in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and secondary (municipal) wastewater treatment plant effluent, respectively.

AB Micropollutants like pharmaceuticals, hormones and pesticides are still found in treated municipal wastewater. An effective way to degrade micropollutants is to use oxidants such as ozone or hydroxyl radicals. We designed an innovative experimental protocol combining batch experiments and a study of a full-scale WWTP to understand and predict the removal via ozonation of typical micropollutants present in secondary treated effluents. First, the direct and indirect ozonation of 47 organic micropollutants was scrutinized, then a model was developed and calibrated to simulate the ozone transfers and the oxidation of the selected micropollutants. The kinetic rate constants between micropollutants and ozone or hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) were determined for 47 micropollutants found in secondary treated effluent. We classified the micropollutants into low- (k(O3) between 1.50 and 4.47 x 10(2) L mol(-1).s(-1)), medium- (k(O3) between 1.31 x 10(3) and 4.92 x 10(3) L mol(-1).s(-1)) and high-oxidizable groups (k(O3) between 9.44 x 10(4) and 8.18 x 10(6) L mol(-1).s(-1)) according to their reactivity with ozone, and identified the major degradation pathways for all 47 micropollutants. Micropolluants of the low- and mediumoxidizable groups were largely eliminated by the indirect pathway, at 96% and 84% on average, respectively. In contrast, micropollutants of high-oxidizable group were largely eliminated by the direct pathway, at 98% on average. The model successfully simulated the direct and indirect ozonation of the 47 micropollutants in batch experiments and confirmed the predominant pathways for each group. Finally, the model was applied to the full-scale ozonation process operated at an ozone dose ranging from 0.5 to 1.6 gO(3).gDOC(-1). The model was found to reliably simulate the ozonation-process removal efficiencies for 4 micropollutants (imidacloprid, fenofibric acid, metronidazole and ketoprofen). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aquatic pollution from emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) is of key environmental importance in India and globally, particularly due to concerns of antimicrobial resistance, ecotoxicity and drinking water supply vulnerability. Here, using a broad screening approach, we characterize the composition and distribution of EOCs in groundwater in the Gangetic Plain around Patna (Bihar), as an exemplar of a rapidly developing urban area in northern India. A total of 73 EOCs were detected in 51 samples, typically at ng.L-1 to low mu g.L-1 concentrations, relating to medical and veterinary, agrochemical, industrial and lifestyle usage. Concentrations were often dominated by the lifestyle chemical and artificial sweetener sucralose. Seventeen identified EOCs are flagged as priority compounds by the European Commission, World Health Organisation and/or World Organisation for Animal Health: namely, herbicides diuron and atrazine; insecticides imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and acetamiprid; the surfactant perfluorooctane sulfonate (and related perfluorobutane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluoropentane sulfonate); and medical/veterinary compounds sulfamethoxazole, sulfanilamide, dapson, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine and diclofenac. The spatial distribution of EOCs varies widely, with concentrations declining with depth, consistent with a strong dominant vertical flow control. Groundwater EOC concentrations in Patna were found to peak within similar to 10 km distance from the River Ganges, indicating mainly urban inputs with some local pollution hot-spots. A heterogeneous relationship between EOCs and population density likely reflects confounding factors including varying input types and controls (e.g. spatial, temporal), wastewater treatment infrastructure and groundwater abstraction. Strong seasonal agreement in EOC concentrations was observed. Co-existence of limited transformation products with associated parent compounds indicate active microbial degradation processes. This study characterizes key controls on the distribution of groundwater EOCs across the urban to rural transition near Patna, as a rapidly developing Indian city, and contributes to the wider understanding of the vulnerability of shallow groundwater to surface-derived contamination in similar environments.

AB In this work, three penicillins (ampicillin "AMP", oxacillin "OXA" and cloxacillin "CLO"), two cephalosporins (cephalexin "CPX" and cephadroxyl "CPD") and three fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin "LEV", norfloxacin "NOR" and ciprofloxacin "CIP") were initially treated by UV254 and persulfate activated by UV254 (UV/PS). Significant differences in degradation kinetics under UV254 irradiation were found. Photodegradation followed the order: OXA > CPX > CPD > CLO > CIP > NOR > AMP >> LEV. Then, in order to study the participation of direct photolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photo degradation a model antibiotic of each class (OXA, CPX and CIP) was considered. OXA and CPX were mainly degraded by direct photolysis, whereas the CIP removal involved ROS and photolysis. On the other hand, the persulfate addition (UV/PS process) improved the removals due to sulfate radical formation, especially, in the case of antibiotics with lower photodegradation levels (i.e. LEV, AMP and NOR). Computational calculations on the representative antibiotics were applied to determine the regions susceptible to electrophilic attacks by degrading agents. The functional groups of OXA and CPX followed the reactivity order: thioether >> 0-lactam ring > benzene ring. For CIP, the piperazyl moiety presented higher reactivity than the quinolone ring. Also, the antimicrobial activity (AA) evolution during the treatments was tested. In the cases of CPX and CIP, both UV254 and UV/PS removed the AA; which were associated with structural changes in their reactive moieties: beta-lactam ring and piperazyl ring, respectively. However, in the case of OXA only the UV/PS system decreased AA, which was attributed to transformations in its penicillin electron-rich nucleus (thioether + 0-lactam). Finally, the applicability of UV254 and UV/PS was assessed using synthetic hospital wastewater (HWW). The processes comparison showed that for practical purposes, OXA and CIP in HWW should be treated by UV/PS, while CPX in HWW could be treated by both UV254 and UV/PS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals constitute an important environmental issue for receiving waters. A holistic approach, taking into consideration the sources of these compounds (hospitals, domestic use), discharges (wastewater effluent, combined sewer overflows) and related risks to the environment, is therefore needed to develop the best protection strategy.
   The substance flow analysis (SFA) approach, applied, for example, to the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, is an ideal tool to tackle these issues. Four substances were considered: one antibiotic (ciprofloxacin), an analgesic (diclofenac), and two anti-epileptics (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Consumption data for the main hospital of the city (916 beds) and for the population were available. Micropollutant concentrations were measured at different points of the system: wastewater inlet and outlet (WWTP), combined sewer overflows (CSO) and in the receiving waters (Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva). Measured and predicted concentrations were in agreement, except for diclofenac, for which analytical uncertainties were expected. Seven different scenarios were considered (supplementary treatment at the WWTP, at the hospital or at both places, etc.). Based on the results obtained, the supplementary treatment at the WWTP decreases the load of pharmaceuticals reaching surface water by a factor between 2 and 27, depending on the compound and on the technique. The treatment at the hospitals only influences the amount of ciprofloxacin reaching the environment and decreases the release by one third. The contribution of CSO to surface water pollution is low compared to that of the WWTP for the selected compounds. Regarding the risk for the receiving waters, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most problematic compound, with a risk quotient far above 1. In this particular case, a treatment at the WWTP is not sufficient to reduce the risk, and additional measures at the CSO or at the hospital should be considered. SFA is an ideal tool for developing the best strategy for pharmaceutical elimination, but its application depends on data availability and local conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ag-BiOBr-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized for the first time and used to promote photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. The Ag-BiOBr-rGO showed an excellent photocatalytic activity to degrade ketoprofen compared with other photocatalysts. The composites were comprehensively characterized to explore the mechanisms of the enhancement. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and scavenger experiments demonstrated that the superoxide radical was the active species. Ketoprofen was completely removed in 120 min. The high photocatalytic activity and stability of the catalyst indicated that the Ag-BiOBr-rGO may have broad application prospects for eliminating pharmaceuticals from wastewater. Four reaction intermediates of ketoprofen were detected by LC-MS/MS and degradation routes were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of intersex fish in watersheds around the world is a warning of the presence of anthropogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) being deposited into the aquatic environment. The anti-diabetic drug metformin is among the most prevalent and ubiquitous of the myriad pharmaceuticals found in wastewater effluent and watersheds worldwide. In addition to its prescription for type-2 diabetes, metformin is indicated as a treatment in cancers and the endocrine disorder polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Our previous research found evidence of endocrine-disruption following Pimephaies promelas (fathead minnow) exposure to metformin at an environmentally relevant concentration. However, the mechanism of action leading to these impacts is unknown. Although metformin does not structurally resemble classical EDCs, there's an increasing recognition that endocrine disruption may occur by mechanisms other than classical endocrine receptor binding, and metformin's off-label use for treating endocrine-related disorders such as PCOS indicates its potential interaction with the endocrine system. To further explore metformin's mechanism of action as an EDC, we measured expression of numerous endocrine-related genes in male fathead minnows exposed to metformin at a low-dose similar to that found in wastewater effluent and the environment (40 mu g L-1) for a full year (early development to adulthood) and discovered significant upregulation of the AR (3.6 +/- 0.9-fold), 3 beta-HSD (3.9 +/- 0.8-fold), 17 beta-HSD (17 +/- 4-fold), CYP19A1 (40 +/- 20-fold), and SULT2A1 (2.3 +/- 0.4-fold) genes in exposed male gonad. We also found a significant correlation between expression of 3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD, and CYP19A1 in testis of metformin-treated male fish and the degree of intersex occurring in their gonads. These results provide additional evidence of the endocrine disrupting impact of the drug metformin and insight into the potential mechanisms by which metformin may influence the endocrine system in aquatic organisms.

AB High resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) offers the opportunity to track large numbers of non-target analytes through water treatment processes, providing a more comprehensive view of reactor performance than targeted evaluation. Both approaches were used to evaluate the performance of a pilot scale advanced oxidation process (AOP) employing ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) to treat municipal wastewater effluent. Twelve pharmaceuticals and personal care products were selected as target compounds and added to reactor influent. Target compound removal over a range of flow rates and hydrogen peroxide addition levels was assessed using a liquid chromatograph combined with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-qTOF-MS). Target compound removals were used to determine hydroxyl radical concentrations and UV fluence under pilot scale conditions. The experiments were also analyzed using a nontarget approach, which identified "molecular features" in either reactor influent or effluent. Strong correlation (r = 0.94) was observed between target compound removals calculated using the targeted and non-targeted approaches across the range of reactor conditions tested. The two approaches also produced consistent rankings of the performance of the various reactor operating conditions, although the distribution of compound removal efficiencies was usually less favorable with the broader, nontarget approach. For example, in the UV only treatment 8.3% of target compounds and 2.2% of non-target compounds exhibited removals above 50%, while 100% of target compounds and 74% of non-target compounds exhibited removals above 50% in the best condition tested. These results suggest that HR-MS methods can provide more holistic evaluation of reactor performance, and may reduce biases caused by selection of a limited number of target compounds. HR-MS methods also offer insights into the composition of poorly removed compounds and the formation of transformation products, which were widely detected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simultaneous elimination of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is rarely investigated in full-scale riverine wetlands. Here, we compared the occurrence, abundance, and removal of 60 antibiotics and 27 ARGs in natural (Yeya Lake (YL)) and constructed (Bai River (BR)) riverine wetlands in Beijing, China. The concentrations of antibiotics in YL wetland were ND-51.9 ng/L. in water and ND-37.9 ng/g in sediments Significantly higher concentrations were found in BR wetland (ND-546 ng/L in water and ND-118 ng/g in sediments), which locates at the downstream of a reclaimed water treatment plant. The abundances of ARGs in YL and BR wetlands were up to 533 x 10(5) and 841 x 10(5) copies/mL in water, and 1.60 x 10(7) and 4.67 x 10(8) copies/g in sediments, respectively. These results suggest that wastewater greatly contributes to the elevated abundance of antibiotics and ARGs in both water and sediments. Compared to summer, higher levels of antibiotics in water were found in winter due to the higher usage, slower attenuation and the limited dilution. But higher abundances of ARGs were found in summer than in winter, in accordance with the favored microbial growth at higher temperature as denoted by copies of 16S rRNA. Compared to BR wetland, YL wetland achieved better removal of antibiotics and Sigma RGs, with average removal efficiencies of 70.0% and 87.5%. Antibiotics, ARGs and environmental factors showed strong correlations in water samples from YL wetland. However, in BR wetland that receives urban wastewater effluents, no correlation between antibiotics and ARGs was found although the distribution of antibiotics was affected by aquatic environmental factors. These results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics may stimulate the prevalence of ARGs in natural wetlands. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports the development of a multi-residue method for determining 48 compounds of emerging concern (CEC) including three diclofenac transformation products (TP) in Slovenian wastewater (WW) and surface water (SW). For solid-phase extraction (SPE), Oasis (TM) Prime cartridges were favoured over Oasis HLB (TM). The validated method was then applied to 43 SW and 52 WW samples collected at nine locations. Ten bisphenols in WW and 14 bisphenols in SW were traced in Europe for the first time. Among all of the 48 targeted CEC, 21 were >LOQ in the influents and 20 in the effluents. One diclofenac TP was also quantified in WWs (3.04-78.1 ng L-1) for the first time. As expected, based on mass loads in the wastewater treatment plant influents, caffeine is consumed in high amounts (105,000 mg day(-1) 1000 inhab.(-1)) in Slovenia, while active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are consumed in lower amounts compared to other European countries. Removal was lower in winter in the case of four bisphenols (17-78%), one preservative (36%) and four APIs (-14-91%), but remained constant for caffeine, one API, two UV-filters and three preservatives (all >85.5%). Overall, a constructed wetland showed the lowest (0-80%) and most inconsistent removal efficiencies (SD > 40% for some CECs) of CECs including caffeine, two UV-filters, two preservatives and two APIs compared to other treatment technologies. The method was also able to quantify Bisphenol Sin SW (<36.2 ng L-1). Environmental risk was assessed via risk quotients (RQs) based on WW and SW data. Two UV-filters (oxybenzone and dioxybenzone), estrone and triclosan, despite their low abundance posed a medium to high environmental risk with RQs between 0.282 (for HM-BP) and 15.5 (for E1).

AB The Llobregat River, which is characterized by important fluctuations of the flow rates, receives treated waters from WWTPs. During the years 2007 and 2008, the Llobregat River basin suffered from a severe drought which affected the supply of drinking water facilities (DWF) that rely on the exploitation of the river water. The Catalan Water Agency implemented a water reuse experiment with the objective of maintaining the river flow rate at sufficiently high level so as to ensure the supply of raw water to Barcelona's major DWF.
   A total of 103 emerging contaminants belonging to the groups of pharmaceuticals (74), illicit drugs (17) and oestrogens (12) were determined using LC-MS/MS methods in river water samples during the water reuse campaign. The effect of the reclaimed water discharge on the river water quality, in terms of contamination loads and environmental risk (based on the concentration addition mode), is discussed.
   Fifty-eight pharmaceuticals out of 74 monitored were detected at least in one sample. In river water upstream (site R0) majority of compounds were detected at low nanograms per litre levels, while downstream of discharge of tertiary effluent only few compounds were detected at levels higher than 100 ng L-1 (i.e. acetaminophen, diclofenac, erythromycin, sulfamethazine), but never exceeding 500 ng L-1. The total concentration of illicit drugs was found to be very low at both sampling sites (< 50 ng L-1). No relevant ecotoxicity risks were identified, except for pharmaceuticals vs. algae.
   In general, the discharge of reclaimed water in the river influenced perceptibly in terms of concentrations, mass loads and environmental risk, especially for pharmaceuticals and in less extent for illicit drugs. Nevertheless, it was not very significant in any case.

AB PHARMACEUTICALS are classified as emerging environmental pollutants that have a potential harmful impact on environment and human health. This study aims to treat the tramadol hydrochloride (TH) in different water resources in Egypt. The identification and quantification of TH was explored using LC/MS/MS instrument. The study proposed kaolinite/ZnO nanocomposite (K/ZnO) as a new solution for TH treatment. The characterization study showed that the highest photodegradation activity was achieved in the case of K/ZnO40%. The photodegradation kinetics and thermodynamics arc investigated. The obtained results reveal that Pseudo-first order model is well fitted with a correlation coefficient (0.990). Moreover, the positive values of Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees show that the photodegradation process is an endothermic reaction. Positive value of free energy indicates that the adsorption process is not spontaneous.

AB Here, we report eggshell membrane (ESM)-derived MgFe2O4 as effective adsorbent for the capture, transfer, and removal of doxycycline (DC) antibiotic and its subsequent recycling for cyclic utilization. The resultant material has meshwork morphology and consists of interconnected and penetrated fibers assembled by MgFe2O4 nanoparticles. The maximal adsorption capacity of ESM-derived MgFe2O4 is about 308 mg g(-1) for DC, and the adsorbed MgFe2O4 can be reused after magnetic separation from water and acid treatment. The strong adsorption ability is attributed to the hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interaction between ESM-derived MgFe2O4 and DC, as well as its porous structure with high surface area.

AB The use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PCPPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has more than doubled since 1950. POPs find their way into aquatic ecosystems through agricultural and industrial runoff, wastewater treatment effluent discharge, and atmospheric deposition. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs), which can produce toxins potent enough to cause human death, have been increasing in intensity, frequency, and spatial scale throughout the same time period as accelerated POP usage. Here, we provide a meta-analysis and suggest that POP stressors may be significantly aggravating nutrient-driven CyanoHABs by suppressing the growth of competing phytoplankton, and/ or by indirectly or directly stimulating cyanobacterial growth.

AB Organic micropollutants (MPs), such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds, and waste breakdown products occurring in waters at ng/L-mu g/L levels are a threat to ecosystems and human health. Adsorption of MPs using granular activated carbon (GAC) is an increasingly common treatment process. Biochar is a promising low-cost, environmentally sustainable surrogate for GAC in diverse water quality applications. Challenges remain, however, for accurately simulating real-world biochar and GAC adsorbers in laboratory experiments. The goal of this research was to develop a scale-up procedure for predicting the adsorption of organic MPs from water containing background dissolved organic matter (DOM) by GAC and biochar using bench-scale column tests. The removal of 11 native MPs in wastewater effluent by GAC and biochar was quantified using pilot-scale adsorbers and rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs). Batch isotherm studies were conducted and RSSCT data were fit with two different surface and pore diffusion models to obtain equilibrium and kinetic parameters for each MP-adsorbent combination. The diffusion models were used to predict MP breakthrough at full scale, and predictions compared with pilot column data. A third scale-up approach was applied using a fouling index to account for the effects of DOM competition and pore blockage on MP uptake. A fourth approach was applied using direct empirical correlation between early MP breakthrough in RSSCT and pilot columns. The criterion for comparison of the ability of model-based and empirical scale-up approaches to accurately simulate pilot-scale adsorption was the number of bed volumes treated until MP breakthrough at 10% of the influent concentration (BV10%). Data obtained in this study as well as from the literature were used to develop an empirical regression based on RSSCT BV10% values to provide a user-oriented, conservative approach to predicting full-scale MP breakthrough that can be used for the design and operation of biochar and GAC treatment systems.

AB Despite their impressive plasmonic photocatalytic activity, nanosized silver and silver halides always suffer from serious agglomeration and photocorrosion, thus are severely restricted in the practical wastewater restoration applications. The design and realization of plasmonic heterojunction nanostructures is an effective way to solve this stability problem, yet the ideal plasmonic catalyst dispersion and immobilization remains a great challenge. In this work, a highly immobilized Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4 plasmonic photocatalyst was developed through a rational in-situ implanting approach, in which the Ag can be homodispersely distributed and strongly coupled with prefixed Cl sites on g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and element mapping images clearly proved the homodispersely distribution of nanosized Ag@AgCl on the CNNS. The optimal Ag@AgCl-3/CNNS plasmonic photocatalyst with a narrow band gap of 2.45 eV and large specific surface area of 52.9 m(2)/g performs well in model pharmaceutical wastewater bleaching reactions under visible light. More importantly, the Ag@AgCl-3/CNNS show good stability compared with the conventional inhomogeneously coupled AgCl/g-C3N4 control as verified by their ultralow silver leakage rate in water (0.00152 mg/gd, accounts 6.9% that of the control) and a much lower corrosion current density (Icorr = 1.63 vs. 3.45 mu A), recorded by Tafel slopes. The synergetic effect of surface plasmon resonance effect of nanosized Ag@AgCl with strong visible light harvesting ability and strong coupling between Ag@AgCl and exfoliated porous g-C3N4 nanosheets can support the fast separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency in the bleaching of antibiotic pollutants and bacteria. This work affords the great potential of the rational in-situ implanting design for high-performance and stable plasmonic photocatalysts.

AB Strategies to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are widely discussed. Especially the evaluation of the potential benefit of further advanced treatment steps such as an additional tertiary treatment based on ozonation or activated carbon have come into focus. Such evaluation strategies are often based on the removal behavior of known micropollutants via target or suspected analysis. The utilization of nontarget analysis is considered to lead to a more comprehensive picture as also unknown or not expected micropollutants are analyzed. Here, the results of an evaluation via target and nontarget analysis were compared for biological treatment (BT) processes of eleven full-scale WWTPs and three different post-treatments (PTs): one sand filter (SF) and two granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. The similarity of the determined removals from target and nontarget analysis of the BTs increased significantly by excluding easily degradable "features" from the nontarget evaluation. A similar ranking of the removal trends for the BTs could also be achieved by comparing this new subset of nontarget features with a set of nine readily to moderately biodegradable micropollutants. This observation suggests that a performance ranking of BTs based either on target or nontarget analysis is plausible. In contrast to the BTs, the evaluation of the three PTs revealed that the difference of feature removal between SF and the two GACs was small, but large for the target analytes with substantially higher removal effciencies for the GACs compared to the SF. In addition to the removal behavior, the nontarget analysis provided further information about the number and quantity of transformation products (TPs) in the effluent from the BTs. For all BTs more than half (55-67%) of the features detected in the effluent were not found in the influent. A comparable proportion of TPs was also detected after GAC and sand filtration due to their microbial activities. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated for the first time the photocatalytic degradation of three well-known transformation products (TPs) of pharmaceutical Tramadol, N-desmethyl-(N-DES), N,N-bidesmethyl (N,N-Bi-DES) and N-oxide-tramadol (N-OX-TRA) in two different aquatic matrices, ultrapure water and secondary treated wastewater, with high (10 mg L-1) and low (50 mu g L-1) initial concentrations, respectively. Total disappearance of the parent compounds was attained in all experiments. For initial concentration of 10 mg L-1, the target compounds were degraded within 30-40 min and a mineralization degree of more than 80% was achieved after 240 min of irradiation, while the contained organic nitrogen was released mainly as NH4+ for N-DES, N, N-Bi-DES and NO3- for N-OX-TRA. The degradation rates of all the studied compounds were considerably decreased in the wastewater due to the presence of inorganic and organic constituents typically found in effluents and environmental matrices which may act as scavengers of the HO center dot. The effect of pH (4, 6.7, 10) in the degradation rates was studied and for N-DES-TRA and N,N-Bi-DES-TRA, the optimum pH value was 6.7. In contrast, N-OX-TRA showed an increasing trend in the photocatalytic degradation kinetic in alkaline solutions (pH 10). The major transformation products were identified by high resolution accurate mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (HR-LC-MS). Scavenging experiments indicated for all studied compounds the important role of HO center dot in the photocatalytic degradation pathways that included mainly hydroxylation and further oxidation of the parent compounds. In addition, Microtox bioassay (Vibrio fischeri) was employed for evaluating the ecotoxicity of photocatalytically treated solutions. Results clearly demonstrate the progressive decrease of the toxicity and the efficiency of the photocatalytic process in the detoxification of the irradiated solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are, along with microbial cells, the main components of the biological sludges used in wastewater treatment and natural biofilms. EPS play a major role in removing pollutants from water by means of sorption. The ability of soluble EPS (S-EPS) and bound EPS (B-EPS) derived from various bacterial aggregates (flocs, granules, biofilms) to bind at pH 7.0 +/- 0.1 to two pharmaceutical substances, acetaminophen (ACE) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (ERY), has been investigated using the fluorescence quenching method. Two intense fluorescence peaks, A (Ex/Em range, 200-250/275-380 nm) and B (Ex/Em range, 260-320/275-360 nm), corresponding respectively to the aromatic protein region and soluble microbial by-product-like region, were identified in a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix of EPS samples. The fluorescence peak, which corresponds to humic-like substances, was also identified though at low intensity. The ability of EPS to bind ACE was found to exceed that for ERY. The aromatic protein fraction of EPS displays a slightly higher affinity for drugs than that shown by the soluble microbial by-product-like fraction. The S-EPS and B-EPS present the same affinity for ACE and ERY. The effective quenching constants (log K) derived from the Stern-Volmer Equation equaled at peak A (with S-EPS): 3.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.1 for ACE and 2.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 for ERY. With B-EPS, these values were 3.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.0 +/- 0.1 for ACE and 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.1 for ERY. Our results suggest that the weaker EPS affinity for ERY than for ACE serves to partially explain why only about 50-80 % of ERY is removed from wastewater at the treatment plant. Moreover, this work demonstrates that EPS from natural river biofilms are able to bind drugs, which in turn may limit the mobility of drugs in natural waters.

AB The visible light photocatalytic degradation of propranolol was studied using cerium doped titanium dioxide, a catalyst that showed an increased light absorption in the visible region. The experiments were carried out in ultrapure water and in a biologically treated wastewater from the secondary effluent of a treatment plant spiked with propranolol. The best results were obtained for a cerium loading of 0.5 wt.% and a bulk catalyst concentration of 0.14 g/L, with which propranolol became essentially depleted after 1.5 h of irradiation. The extent of mineralization reached 17.4% after 6 h on stream under the same conditions. Both oxidation on catalyst holes and reaction with hydroxyl radicals contribute to propranolol depletion, but for the reaction conditions tested in this study, the first mechanism predominated and accounted for 60% of the propranolol rate constant. The runs performed in wastewater matrix led to a very low photocatalytic rate compared with pure water, which was attributed to the presence of radical scavengers and competing substances. Over thirty reaction intermediates were detected by means of exact mass measurements performed by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) based on the characteristic fragmentation of oxidation by-products. Their relative abundance was also assessed in catalytic and non-catalytic runs. The most abundant transformation products could be attributed to the cleavage of the ether bond of propranolol. Other compounds detected derived from the addition of hydroxyl groups to the aromatic nuclei or to the ring-opening attack of hydroxyl radicals on the naphthol moiety. Finally, the toxicity of oxidized mixtures was determined using the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Although the toxicity of treated mixtures tended to decrease as propranolol was depleted, mixtures treated in pure water may lead to the accumulation of toxic transformation products.

AB This study presents the ultrasound mediated reduction of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) into non-toxic trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) using sludge obtained during the electrocoagulation of pharmaceutical wastewater (EC sludge). Experiments were carried out with and without ultrasound to explore its influence. The effect of initial concentration of Cr(VI) (100-200 mg/l), pH (6-8) and EC sludge dosage (5-10 g/l) on Cr(VI) reduction was studied. The morphological and functional group changes of EC sludge due to Cr(VI) reduction were analysed with scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared, respectively. The reduction rates observed in the presence of ultrasound were found to be higher than the rates observed for without ultrasound. The results concluded that the EC sludge can be successfully used for reduction of Cr(VI) at lower cost.

AB Detection and quantification of Pharmaceutical and Personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewaters and aqueous samples is crucial in terms of environmental monitoring and risk assessment for these emerging contaminants in the environment. The majority of the studies on PPCPs in wastewaters involve analysis only of representative compounds for each class, while few studies reported for the analysis of several compounds from multiple classes of PPCPs in samples. In this light, the aim of this work was to develop a multiresidue analytical protocol based on solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometer-(LC-MS/MS) for simultaneous determination of 138 substances including 37 different classes of PPCPs that can be used for monitoring in wastewater. Hence, an extensive monitoring survey of PPCPs in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities of North (Thessaloniki) and Central (Larisa, Volos) Greece region has been conducted. In addition, the occurrence of the target compounds in raw waters of effluents from two medium-size hospitals located in the Larisa Region was investigated. Analgesics-anti-inflammatories (paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, salicylic acid), diuretic (furosemide), antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), anti-hypertensives (valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram), stimulant (caffeine) and beta blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol) were among the most frequently detected compounds. The removal rates varied between the different therapeutic groups, as well within each therapeutic group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100%. Mass loading distribution in the different WWTPs was also evaluated. Finally, the risk quotient approach (RQ) for single substances and the cumulative RQ for the classes of the target PPCPs was used in order to identify the potential ecotoxicological risk posed in the tree trophic levels of aquatic organisms.

AB The present work aimed to explore the potential of autochthonous microorganisms from an urban estuary and from activated sludge of an associated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), for biodegradation of an antidepressant drug, paroxetine, and on a cholesterol-lowering agent, bezafibrate. These compounds were chosen as representatives of extensively used pharmaceuticals. Autochthonous microorganisms from the indicated sources were exposed to the target pharmaceuticals (1 mg/L) in co-metabolism with sodium acetate (500 mg/L) along a two-weeks period, for a total of 7 two-weeks periods (here referred as cycles). Exposures were carried out in batch mode, under different incubation conditions (agitation vs. static). Removal of pharmaceuticals was monitored at the end of each cycle, by analysing the culture medium. For paroxetine, fluoride ion release was also followed as an indicator of defluorination of the molecule. The structure of the bacterial communities was analysed by ARISA (Automated rRNA Intergenic Spacer Analysis), at the beginning of the experiment and at the end of the first and the last cycles to identify substantial changes associated with the time of exposure, the incubation conditions and the presence and type of pharmaceuticals. Incubation conditions affected not only the bacterial community structure, but also the biodegradation efficiency. At the beginning of the experiment, removal of target pharmaceuticals was found to be lower under agitation than under static conditions, but at the end of the experiment, results showed high removal of the pharmaceuticals from the culture medium (> 97%) under both conditions, mainly by microbiological processes. For paroxetine, adsorption and abiotic processes also had an important influence on its removal, but defluorination only occurred in the presence of microorganisms. These results highlight that autochthonous microorganisms from estuarine sediments and WWTP sludge have high ability to remove the selected pharmaceuticals with relevant implications for the development of new bioremediation tools for environmental restoration.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are considered highly competitive water treatment technologies for the removal of organic pollutants. Among AOP techniques, photocatalysis has recently been the most widely studied. Our aims were to investigate how the dispersion of nanosized titanium dioxide (nanoTiO(2)) applied in photodegradation-based procedures can be stabilized with cyclodextrins in order to obtain a new, more efficient photocatalyst for the purification of waters polluted by xenobiotics applying UV irradiation. During our work, on the one hand, we studied the behavior and stability of nanoTiO(2) in cyclodextrin solutions. On the other hand, we used various monomer and polymer cyclodextrin derivatives, and assessed the options for nanoTiO(2) stabilization in the presence of various salts and tap water on the basis of turbidity tests. The physical stability of nanoTiO(2) dispersions is diminished in the presence of the salts found in tap water (and occurring also in surface waters and ground water) and they are precipitated immediately. This colloidal instability can be improved by cyclodextrin derivatives. Based on the results of our studies we have selected carboxymethyl beta-cyclodextrin polymer (CMBCD-P) for stabilization of nanoTiO(2) dispersions. The photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and ibuprofen as model organic pollutants in various media (distilled water, NaCl solution and tap water) has been studied using nanoTiO(2) as catalyst stabilized by CMBCD-P. CMBCD-P itself showed a catalytic effect on the UV degradation of methylene blue. In addition to enhancing the colloid stability of nanoTiO(2) CMBCD-P showed also synergistic effects in catalyzing the photodecomposition process of the dye. On the other hand, ibuprofen as a model pharmaceutical, a pollutant of emerging concern (EP), was protected by CMBCD-P against the photocatalytic degradation showing that inclusion complex formation can result in opposite effects depending on the structure of the host-guest complex.

AB Antibiotic pollution in aquatic systems is a concern for human and environmental health. The concern is largely due to the global occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. From 2017 to 2018 in the NC Piedmont, 15 ion masses associated with antibiotics were detected in rural streams and groundwater. Four of these masses were confirmed to be antibiotics through target analysis (sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine, erythromycin, danofloxacin). Concentrations of antibiotics were as high as 1.8 mu g/L. As a follow-up, antibiotic residues in urban streams sites in Greensboro, NC, USA, were investigated. Urban streams are heavily influenced by the dense populations surrounding them. In the fall, winter, and spring seasons, surface water was collected from eight sites along two urban streams. Sampling was conducted at streams sites above and below municipal hospitals and wastewater treatment facilities in the study area. At the conclusion of the survey, nine ion masses associated with antibiotics used in both human and veterinary medicine were detected from surface water collected. Three of the four antibiotics targeted in rural stream samples were detected and confirmed in urban stream samples (sulfamerazine, danofloxacin, and erythromycin). Detection frequencies of the three antibiotics ranged from 0 to 46%. Concentrations of each target antibiotic was as followed: SMX (0 to <10 ng/L), SMR (0 to <11 ng/L), DAN (0 to <20 ng/L), and ETM (0 to <15 ng/L). Each target antibiotic concentration was below our methods quantification limits. Our risk assessment analysis showed that the target antibiotics posed no risk to fish, daphnia, and green algae within this region of NC (RQ < 0.1). Compared to rural streams in this region of NC, antibiotic pollution is less prevalent in urban streams. The differences between urban and rural streams may be driven by the varying land use and suggest more research should be dedicated to monitoring these contaminants in rural areas of the United States.

AB Contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) spread across a wide range of organic product compounds. As biorecalcitrants, their removal from conventional wastewater treatment systems remains a herculean task. To address this issue, heterogenous solar driven advanced oxidation process based-TiO2 and other semiconductor materials has been extensively studied for their abatement from wastewater sources. In this study, we have synthesized by hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation Ag doped ZnSnO3. Structural and morphological characterizations were performed via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), N-2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) methods, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy coupled with Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and UV-visible absorption in Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis/DRS) mode. Crystallite size estimate for Ag-ZnSnO3 and undoped form was 19.4 and 29.3 nm, respectively, while respective TEM particle size estimate was 79.0 nm and 98.2 nm. BET surface area and total pore volume by BJH for Ag-ZnSnO3 were estimated with respective values of 17.2 m(2)/g and 0.05 cm(3)/g in comparison to 18.8 m(2)/g and 0.06 cm(3)/g for ZnSnO3. Derived energy band gap (Eg) values were 3.8 eV for Ag-ZnSnO3 and 4.2 eV for ZnSnO3. Photocatalytic performance of Ag-ZnSnO3 was tested towards caffeine achieving about 68% removal under (natural) unmodified pH = 6.50 and almost 100% removal at initial pH around 7.5 after 4 h irradiation. The effect of initial pH, catalyst dosage, pollutant concentration, charge scavengers, H2O2, contaminant inorganic ions (anions) as well as humic acid (HA) on the photocatalyst activity over caffeine degradation were assessed. In accordance with the probation test of the reactive species responsible for photocatalytic degradation process, a reaction mechanism was deduced.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely detected pharmaceutical in wastewaters, cannot currently be treated by conventional activated sludge technologies, as it is highly resistant to biodegradation. In this study, the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms of CBZ by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were investigated with a combined experimental/theoretical approach. We first measured the UV absorption spectrum of CBZ and compared it to the theoretical spectrum. The agreement of two spectra reveals an extended pi-conjugation system on CBZ molecular structure. The second-order rate constants of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- with CBZ, measured by competition kinetics method, were (4.63 +/- 0.01) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and (8.27 +/- 0.01) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively at pH 3. The energetics of the initial steps of CBZ reaction with (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- were also calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at SMD/M05-2X/6-311++G**//M05-2X/6-31 + G**level. Our results reveal that radical addition is the dominant pathway for both (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-. Further, compared to the positive Delta G(R)(0) value for the single electron transfer (SET) reaction pathway between CBZ and (OH)-O-center dot, the Delta G(R)(0) value for SET reaction between CBZ and SO4 center dot- is negative, showing that this reaction route is thermodynamically favorable. Our results demonstrated the remarkable advantages of AOPs for the removal of refractory organic contaminants during wastewater treatment processes. The elucidation of the pathways for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- with CBZ are beneficial to predict byproducts formation and assess associated ecotoxicity, providing an evaluation mean for the feasibility of AOPs application.

AB Antibiotics are pharmaceuticals widely consumed and frequently detected in environmental water, where they can induce toxic effects and development of resistant bacteria. Their structural variety makes the problem of antibiotics in natural water more complex. In this work, six highly used antibiotics (at 40 mu mol L-1) belonging to three different classes (penicillins, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones) were treated using an electrochemical system with a Ti/IrO2 anode and a Zr cathode in the presence of NaCl (0.05 mu mol L-1). The attack of electrogenerated active chlorine was found to be the main degradation route. After only 20 min of treatment, the process decreased more than 90% of the initial concentration of antibiotics, following the degradation order: fluoroquinolones > penicillins > cephalosporins. The primary interactions of the degrading agent with fluoroquinolones occurred at the cyclic amine (i.e., piperazyl ring) and the benzene ring. Meanwhile, the cephalosporins and penicillins were initially attacked on the beta-lactam and sulfide groups. However, the tested penicillins presented an additional reaction on the central amide. In all cases, the transformations of antibiotics led to the antimicrobial activity decreasing. On the contrary, the toxicity level showed diverse results: increasing, decreasing, and no change, depending on the antibiotic type. In fact, due to the conservation of quinolone nucleus in the fluoroquinolone by-products, the toxicity of the treated solutions remained unchanged. With penicillins, the production of chloro-phenyl-isoxazole fragments increased the toxicity level of the resultant solution. However, the opening of beta-lactam ring of cephalosporin antibiotics decreased the toxicity level of the treated solutions. Finally, the application of the treatment to synthetic hospital wastewater and seawater containing a representative antibiotic showed that the high amount of chloride ions in seawater accelerates the pollutant degradation. In contrast, the urea and ammonium presence in the hospital wastewater retarded the removal of this pharmaceutical.

AB The recent development of broad-scope high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) screening methods has resulted in a much improved capability for new compound identification in environmental samples. However, positive identifications at the ng/L concentration level rely on analytical reference standards for chromatographic retention time (t(R)) and mass spectral comparisons. Chromatographic t(R) prediction can play a role in increasing confidence in suspect screening efforts for new compounds in the environment, especially when standards are not available, but reliable methods are lacking. The current work focuses on the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for t(R) prediction in gradient reversed-phase liquid chromatography and applied along with HRMS data to suspect screening of wastewater and environmental surface water samples. Based on a compound t(R) dataset of >500 compounds, an optimized 4-layer back-propagation multi-layer perceptron model enabled predictions for 85% of all compounds to within 2 min of their measured t(R) for training (n = 344) and verification (n = 100) datasets. To evaluate the ANN ability for generalization to new data, the model was further tested using 100 randomly selected compounds and revealed 95% prediction accuracy within the 2-minute elution interval. Given the increasing concern on the presence of drug metabolites and other transformation products (TPs) in the aquatic environment, the model was applied along with HRMS data for preliminary identification of pharmaceutically-related compounds in real samples. Examples of compounds where reference standards were subsequently acquired and later confirmed are also presented. To our knowledge, this work presents for the first time, the successful application of an accurate retention time predictor and HEMS data-mining using the largest number of compounds to preliminarily identify new or emerging contaminants in wastewater and surface waters.

AB This work critically compared the removal of fluorescing PARAFAC components and selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) from a tertiary wastewater effluent by different UV- and ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) operated at pilot-scale. Investigated AOPs included UV/H2O2, UV/Cl-2, O-3, O-3/UV, H2O2/O-3/UV, and the new Cl-2/O-3/UV. AOPs comparison was accomplished using various ozone doses (0- 9 mg/L), UV fluences (191-981 mJ/cm(2)) and radical promoter concentrations of Cl-2 = 0.04 mM and H2O2 = 0.29 mM. Chlorine-based AOPs produced radical species that reacted more selectively with pharmaceuticals than radical species and oxidants generated by other AOPs. Tryptophan-like substances and humic-like fluorescing compounds were the most degraded components by all AOPs, which were better removed than microbial products and fulvic-like fluorescing substances. Removal of UV absorbance at 254 (UV254) nm was always low. Overall, chlorine- based AOPs were more effective to reduce fluorescence intensities than similar H2O2-based AOPs. The Cl-2/O-3/UV process was the most effective AOP to degrade all target micro-pollutants except primidone. On the other hand, the oxidation performance of pharmaceuticals by other ozone-based AOPs followed the order H2O2/O-3/UV > O-3/UV > O-3. UV/Cl-2 process outcompeted UV/H2O2 only for the removal of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Correlations between the removal of pharmaceuticals and spectroscopic indexes (PARAFAC components and UV254) had unique regression parameters for each compound,surrogate parameter and oxidation process. Particularly, a diverse PARAFAC component for each investigated AOP resulted to be the most sensitive surrogate parameter able to monitor small changes of pharmaceuticals removal.

AB A framework is presented that is intended to facilitate the evaluation of potential aquatic ecological risks resulting from discharges of down-the-drain chemicals. A scenario is presented using representatives of many of the types of chemicals that are treated domestically. Predicted environmental chemical concentrations are based on reported loading rates and routine removal rates for 3 types of treatment: trickling filter, activated sludge secondary treatment, and activated sludge plus advanced oxidation process as well as instream effluent dilution. In tier I, predicted effluent concentrations were compared with the lowest predicted-no-effect concentration (PNEC) obtained from the literature using safety factors as needed. A cumulative risk characterization ratio (cumRCR) <1.0 indicates that risk is unlikely and no further action is needed. Otherwise, a tier 2 assessment is used, in which PNECs are based on trophic level. If tier 2 indicates a possible risk, then a retrospective assessment is recommended. In tier 1, the cumRCR was >1.0 for all 3 treatment types in our scenario, even though no chemical exceeded a hazard quotient of 1.0 in activated sludge or advanced oxidation process. In tier 2, activated sludge yielded a lower cumRCR than trickling filter because of higher removal rates, and the cumRCR in the advanced oxidation process was <<1.0. Based on the maximum cumulative risk ratio (MCR), more than one-third of the predicted risk was accounted for by one chemical, and at least 90% was accounted for by 3 chemicals, indicating that few chemicals influenced the mixture risk in our scenario. We show how a retrospective assessment can test whether certain chemicals hypothesized as potential drivers in the prospective assessment could have, or are having, deleterious effects on aquatic life.

AB Methylene blue is generally used as dyeing agent in textile, printing and pharmaceutical industries, which leads to the obtaining of large amounts of wastewater. The purpose of this study is to remove methylene blue dye from aqueous solutions using fir wood sawdust waste as low cost biosorbent material. In order to evaluate the adsorption process, analyses for determination of micrometric properties, infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy and colorimetry were performed. To increase the efficiency of the process and the adsorption surface, the fir wood sawdust was grinded and sieved. Some specific parameters were varied in the experimental part in order to study the influence of the adsorbent support dose, concentration, temperature, contact time, volume and stirring rate. The removal efficiency of methylene blue dye was further studied for evaluating the adsorption capacity of the fir wood sawdust.

AB Liquid foams are two-phase systems in which a large volume of gas is dispersed as bubbles in a continuous liquid phase. These foams are ubiquitous in nature. In addition, they are found in industrial applications, such as pharmaceutical formulation, food processing, wastewater treatment, construction, and cosmetics. Recently, we reported a new type of foam material, capillary foam, which is stabilized by the synergistic action of particles and a small amount of an immiscible secondary liquid. In this study, we explore in more detail the foam preparation routes. To illustrate some of the potential applications, we create vividly colored wet and dried foams, which are difficult to prepare using traditional methods, and load-bearing porous solids. The combined action of particles and immiscible secondary fluid confers exceptional stability to capillary foams and many options for functionalization, suggesting a wide range of possible applications.

AB Their unique hydrological and climatic conditions render surface water systems in the southern Canadian Prairies at an elevated risk from exposure to contaminants released from municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs). The aim of this study was to characterize the potential health effects and their underlying molecular mechanisms in populations of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas; FHM) in Wascana Creek, an effluent dominated stream in Southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Studies were conducted during the spawning season in 2014 and 2015 to assess responses in terms of overall health, reproductive functions, plasma sex steroid hormone levels, and expression of selected genes along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. FHM downstream of the effluent fallout had lower gonadosomatic indices and significantly greater hepatosomatic indices compared to upstream populations. In both male and female FHMs, significantly greater occurrence and severity of gonadal degradation and delayed maturation were observed in downstream fish compared to upstream fish. Downstream males also displayed lower scores of secondary sexual characteristics and a decreasing trend in plasma 11-ketotestosterone levels. Interestingly, no indications of exposure to estrogenic compounds, such as occurrence of testicular oocytes were observed, which was in accordance with the lack of presence of key biomarkers of estrogenic exposure, such as induction of vitellogenin. In general, expression of the majority of transcripts measured in FHMs downstream of the effluent fallout was significantly downregulated, which supports observations of the general deterioration of the health and reproductive status of these fish. Chemical analysis indicated that 10 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were present at the downstream site, some at sufficiently great concentrations that may present a risk to aquatic organisms. With continuous exposure to a diverse number of stressors including high nutrient and ammonia levels, the presence of a variety of PPCPs and other contaminants, Wascana Creek should be considered as an ecosystem at risk.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) is one of the frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and aquatic environment. However, little is known about the effect of IBU and its biotransformation products (TPs) on different biological sludge systems and aquatic environment. The effects and toxicity of IBU and TPs on three biological sludge systems (i.e., activated sludge (AS), sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)-enriched sludge and anaerobic methanogenic (AnM) sludge systems) and aquatic environment were comprehensively evaluated through a long-term operation of three bioreactors and a series of batch experiments. Both of the SRB-enriched sludge and AnM sludge systems were not affected under a long-term exposure to IBU, based on removing organic carbon and sulfur and producing methane. This could be attributed to the high tolerance of functional microbes in the SRB-enriched sludge (e.g., genus Desulfobacter) and AnM sludge systems (e.g., genus Candidatus Methanomethylicus) for IBU. In contrast, IBU had some apparently inhibitory effects on the AS system, such as reduced organic removal efficiency and poor sludge settling. The analysis on microbial community revealed that IBU significantly inhibited the genera involved in organic degradation (e.g., genus Candidatus Competibacter) and also stimulated those genera (e.g., genus Brachymonas) to secret excess extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which thus caused sludge bulking in the AS system. The toxicity of IBU and its TPs in the effluent of the AS system was also investigated with Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition tests and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis by ecological structureactivity relationship (ECOSAR) program. The results indicated that the AS system could effectively eliminate the acute toxicity of both IBU and TPs, but a potential chronic toxicity of IBU could still existed, which could be more harmful to aquatic organisms than that of its TPs. These findings provide an insight into the toxic effects of IBU and its TPs on biological sludge systems and ecosystem.

Moreover, in order to investigate the structure of the prepared membranes scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to obtain surface and cross-section images. A long-term filtration test was carried out in a bench scale submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) system, fed by real pharmaceutical wastewater, to evaluate the antibiofouling performance of the prepared neat and nanocomposite membranes. In comparison to the neat PVDF, the pure water flux of the nanocomposite PVDF membrane (PVDF/Ag-SiO2; 0.6 wt %) increased about 60% and the water contact angle decreased from about 99 degrees to 89 degrees. The obtained results showed that the nanocomposite PVDF/Ag-SiO2 membrane exhibits considerable antibiofouling properties such that the accumulated dried biofilm as well as the extra cellular polymeric substances (EPSs) collected from the cake layer decreased considerably for the nanocomposite membrane. Moreover, the flux recovery ratio increased from 58% for the neat PVDF membrane to 76% for the nanocomposite PVDF/Ag-SiO2 membrane. The excitation and emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that the accumulated protein on the surface of nanocomposite membranes decreased considerably in a way that the peak corresponding to tryptophan protein-like substances diminished completely, indicating the high antibiofouling potential of nanocomposite membranes. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium removal efficiencies of the neat and nanocomposite membranes were higher than 90% and 95%, respectively, indicating negligible impact of the membrane modification on the effluents' quality.

AB In this work, the sonochemical treatment (at 354 kHz and 88 W L-1) of six relevant antibiotics belonging to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), penicillins (oxacillin and cloxacillin) and cephalosporins (cephalexin and cephadroxyl) classes was evaluated. Firstly, the ability of the process to eliminate them was tested, showing that sonodegradation of these antibiotics is strongly chemical structure-dependent. Thus, correlations among initial degradation rate of pollutants (Rd), solubility in water (Sw), water-octanol partition coefficient (Log P) and topological polar surface area (TPSA) were tested. Rd exhibited a good correlation with Log P (i.e., the hydrophobicity degree of antibiotics). The considered penicillins had the fastest elimination and from the constitutional analysis using Lemke method was clear that the functional groups arrangement on these antibiotics made them highly hydrophobics. The penicillins were degraded closer at cavitation bubble than the fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins. The investigation of degradation products showed that sonogenerated hydroxyl radical primary attacked the beta-lactam ring of cloxacillin and cephalexin, whereas on norfloxacin induced a decarboxylation. On the other hand, the evolution of antimicrobial activity was also followed. It was evidenced the process capacity to remove antimicrobial activity from treated solutions, which was associated to the transformations of functional groups on antibiotics with important role for interaction with bacteria. Additionally, degradation of antibiotics having the highest (the most hydrophobic, i.e., cloxacillin) and lowest (the most hydrophilic, i.e., cephadroxyl) Rd, was performed in synthetic matrices (hospital wastewater and seawater). Ultrasound degraded both antibiotics; for cloxacillin in such waters higher eliminations than in distilled water were observed (probably due to a salting-out effect exerted by matrix components). Meanwhile, for cephadroxyl a moderate inhibition of degradation in hospital wastewater and seawater respect to distilled water was found, this was related to competition by hydroxyl radical of the other substances in the matrices. These results show the quite selectivity of high frequency ultrasound to eliminate antibiotics form different classes even in complex matrices.

AB While ozonation is considered an efficient treatment to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from secondary wastewater effluents, the presence and persistence of transformation products (TPs) resulting from ozonation of TrOCs is a major concern that should be assessed prior to effluent discharge to the environment. Venlafaxine (VLX), an environmentally relevant tertiary amine-containing TrOC, was chosen as the model for this study. TP analysis confirmed that the lone electron pair of the non-protonated amine are the predominant site of oxidant attack, and therefore strongly affected by pH value and VLX speciation. N-oxide VLX (NOV), the primary ozone-induced TP, was formed and degraded simultaneously during ozonation of VLX-containing secondary effluent and reached a maximumyield of 0.44 to 0.85 (NOV-to-VLX0 ratio), depending on pH and hydroxyl (OH) radical presence. Rate constants for the reaction of NOV with ozone (3.1 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1)) and OH radicals (5.3 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) were determined. A simple kinetic model was developed to fit the kinetics of formation and degradation of NOV during ozonation in secondary effluents, based on a known ozone-reaction kinetic equation. The biodegradability of NOV (degradation rate of 39%) was significantly lower than that of the parent compound (VLX, 92%) after 71 days, as evaluated by modified Zahn-Wellens tests, suggesting that N-oxide products are not better removed than the parent compound in a simulated biological post-treatment, which may even result in partial reformation of the parent compound. Lessons learned from this study were supported by a pilot-scale demonstration at the Shafdan wastewater-treatment plant, confirming the presence of NOV after ozonation and its persistence in biological post-treatment. Removal of such persistent TP will require higher dosages or promotion of OH-radicals during ozonation. Nevertheless, further assessment of the toxicity of persistent TPs relative to the parent compound is needed for complete evaluation of concerned TPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tyrosol is a high-value added polyphenolic compound with inherent antioxidant properties and increasing market demand for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry applications. As a natural occurring antioxidant, the main source of tyrosol is olive mill wastewater (OMW), a by-product of olive oil processing that causes serious environmental issues due to its large volumes with high organic loads. Therefore, the valorization of OMW by recovering valuable antioxidants whilst reducing the overall toxicity of the aqueous stream is an attractive approach to promote sustainable OMW treatment and management. Herein we propose the utilization of hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) to replace conventional volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as extraction solvents to recover tyrosol from aqueous solutions. The operating temperature, the solvent to feed ratio, the effect of salt addition, the solvent physical properties and the solvent structure have been studied to optimize the extraction efficiency of tyrosol from water using [P-4441][Tf2N], [N-4441][Tf2N], and [N-8881][Tf2N] ILs. Comprehensive experimental comparisons using ethyl acetate as a benchmark VOC solvent for tyrosol recovery have been performed. Moreover, the regeneration of the ILs and their subsequent recycling into the tyrosol extraction process have been addressed. Results show the capability of the aforementioned ILs to efficiently recover tyrosol under optimum operating conditions. Adding sodium salts, mainly NaCl, was proven to enhance the tyrosol selectivity towards the IL phase. Moreover, the solubility of ILs in the aqueous phase was found negligible, unlike ethyl acetate, and the water solubility in ethyl acetate was notably higher than in the hydrophobic ILs. Furthermore, back-extraction of tyrosol using inexpensive NaOH followed by IL recycling into the extraction process was successfully accomplished. Additional quantum chemical calculations were performed to provide insights into the behaviour of tyrosol-IL systems. Finally, [P-4441] [Tf2N] was revealed particularly promising for tyrosol recovery, providing similar extraction efficiency as conventional VOC solvents, proven capacity for regeneration and subsequent recycling, and adequate physical properties.

AB The photocatalytic oxidation with UV-A irradiation was tested for the treatment of a mixture of five parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben and benzylparaben) that may be present industrial wastewater. A wide variety of noble metals such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag) and gold (Au), supported on titanium dioxide (TiO2) were used, and their activity was compared with that of pure TiO2 and photolysis. The degradation rate of single parabens followed a pseudo-first order kinetics. Besides, the photocatalytic reaction rate constant based on fluence was also determined. The kinetic constant increased with the number of carbons on the chain linked to the aromatic ring. Direct photolysis led to only 4% of parabens degradation whilst the presence of catalysts improved parabens depletion as well as TOC and COD removal. For the best catalysts, Ag and Pd on TiO2, a reduction higher than 50% of the initial parabens concentration was achieved after 180 min of reaction. The highest degradation rate was attained for BeP with Pd-TiO2 (75%). These catalysts (Ag and Pd) led to a COD removal of 17 and 19%, whereas TOC removal reached 22 and 25%, respectively. The toxicity of the parabens solutions before and after all treatments was evaluated using three different species. For Vibrio fischeri the toxicity after treatment remains high. The germination index of Lepidium sativum increased in the presence of treated effluents while Corbicula fluminea mortality decreased for the solutions treated by photocatalysis using Pd-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2. The fact that total COD removal and mineralization were not achieved, indicates the presence of some final refractory compounds. The toxicity analysis points out that, for the best catalysts, the treated solutions are less environmentally harmful than the initial mixture, since the parabens concentration could be substantially reduced. These results reveal that, even using low catalyst loads, Ag-TiO2 and Pd-TiO2 are interesting catalytic materials for photocatalytic degradation of industrial wastewater containing parabens.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in aquatic environments is of increasing concern due to the presence of residues in fish and aquatic organisms, and emerging antibiotic resistance. Wastewater release is an important contributor to the presence of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems, where they may accumulate in food webs. The traditional environmental surveillance approach relies on the targeted analysis of specific compounds, but more suspect screening methods have been developed recently to allow for the identification of a variety of contaminants. In this study, a method based on QuEChERS extraction-using acetonitrile/water mixture as solvent and PSA/C18 for sample cleanup-was applied to identify pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in fish livers. Both target and suspect screening workflows were used and fish were sampled upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants from the Scioto River, Ohio (USA). The method performed well in terms of extraction of some target PPCPs, with recoveries generally above 90%, good repeatability (<20%), and linearity. Based on target analysis, lincomycin and sulfamethoxazole were two antibiotics identified in fish livers at average concentrations of 30.3 and 25.6 ng g & minus;1 fresh weight, respectively. Using suspect screening, another antibiotic, azithromycin and an antidepressant metabolite, erythrohydrobupropion were identified (average concentrations: 27.8 and 13.8 ng g & minus;1, respectively). The latter, reported, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time in fish livers, was also found at higher concentrations in fish livers sampled downstream vs. upstream. The higher frequency of detection for azithromycin in benthic feeding fish species (63%) as well as clusters identified between different foraging groups suggest that foraging behavior may be an important mechanism in the bioaccumulation of PPCPs.

AB Emerging pollutants appear more frequently in the environment and adverse effects affects not only human health but also the environment. This study evaluated the efficiency of two types of constructed wetlands (CWs) and a 12-unit mesocosm-scale system to remove ibuprofen and caffeine compounds: (i) vertical flow constructed wetland (VF-CW) planted with Heliconia rostrata using sand as filter media with and without earthworms; (ii) free-floating surface horizontal flow constructed wetland with Eichhornia crassipes macrophyte (FFM-CW); and (iii) mesocosm-scale 12 unit system using Eichhornia crassipes with clean water (opposed to wastewater), where the intention was to evaluate the removal of the added compounds without effects from wastewater or biofilm. The systems were efficient in removing the pollutants and demonstrated a limit for the applied COD and BOD rates, where the adequate application rate was 120 g COD.m(-2).d(-1) and 70 g BOD.m(-2).d(-1) to obtain maximum removal efficiency. TP varied independent of the applied load, while TN and NH4+ showed removals (99%) close to the applied rates (9 g TN.m(-2).d(-1) and 7 g NH4+.m(-2).d(-1) for the VF-CW and 8.5 g TN. m(-2). d(-1) and 5 g NH4+. m(-2). d(-1) for the FFM-CW). The emerging contaminants removal efficiency in the VF-CW was 97 and 89% for caffeine and ibuprofen, respectively. Inserting earthworms did not show a significant variation in relation to compound removal. The FFM-CW system removed 94 and 89% of the caffeine and ibuprofen, respectively. The VF-CW system with filter media presented better removal for caffeine and ibuprofen when compared to the FFMCW. The performance between the macrophyte E. crassipes systems in the mesocosm units showed potential to remove emerging compounds even though clean water was used, with a 70% removal efficiency for caffeine and ibuprofen.

AB Due to the activities inherent to medical care units, the hospital effluent released contains diverse contaminants such as tensoactives, disinfectants, metals, pharmaceutical products and chemical reagents, which are potentially toxic to the environment since they receive no treatment or are not effectively removed by such treatment before entering the drain. They are incorporated into municipal wastewater, eventually entering water bodies where they can have harmful effects on organisms and can result in ecological damage. To determine the toxicological risk induced by this type of eflluents, eight metals and 11 pharmaceuticals were quantified, in effluent from a hospital. Developmental effects, teratogenesis and oxidative stress induction were evaluated in two bioindicator species: Xenopus laevis and Lithobates catesbeianus. FETAX (frog embryo teratogenesis assay Xenopus) was used to obtain the median lethal concentration (LC50), effective concentration inducing 50% malformation (EC50), teratogenic index (TI), minimum concentration to inhibit growth (MCIG), and the types of malformation induced. Twenty oocytes in midblastula transition were exposed to six concentrations of effluent (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1%) and negative and positive (6-aminonicotinamide) controls. After 96 h of exposure, diverse biomarkers of oxidative damage were evaluated: hydroperoxide content, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. TI was 3.8 in X. laevis and 4.0 in L. catesbeianus, both exceed the value in the FETAX protocol (1.2), indicating that this effluent is teratogenic to both species. Growth inhibition was induced as well as diverse malformation including microcephaly, cardiac and facial edema, eye malformations, and notochord, tail, fin and gut damage. Significant differences relative to the control group were observed in both species with all biomarkers. This hospital effluent contains contaminants which represents a toxic risk, since these substances are teratogenic to the bioindicators used. The mechanism of damage induction may be associated with oxidative stress. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work investigated the application of a solar driven advanced oxidation process (solar Fenton), for the degradation of the antibiotic ofloxacin (OFX) in various environmental matrices at a pilot-scale. All experiments were carried out in a compound parabolic collector pilot plant in the presence of doses of H2O2 (2.5 mg L-1) and at an initial Fe2+ concentration of 2 mg L-1. The water matrices used for the solar Fenton experiments were: demineralized water (DW), simulated natural freshwater (SW), simulated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant (SWW) and pre-treated real effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant (RE) to which OFX had been spiked at 10 mg L-1. Dissolved organic carbon removal was found to be dependent on the chemical composition of the water matrix. OFX mineralization was higher in DW (78.1%) than in SW (58.3%) at 12 mg L-1 of H2O2 consumption, implying the complexation of iron or the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals by the inorganic ions present in SW. On the other hand, the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SWW and RE, led to lower mineralization per dose of H2O2 compared to DW and SW. The major transformation products (TPs) formed during the solar Fenton treatment of OFX, were elucidated using liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ToF-MS). The transformation of OFX proceeded through a defluorination reaction, accompanied by some degree of piperazine and quinolone substituent transformation while a hydroxylation mechanism occurred by attack of the hydroxyl radicals generated during the process leading to the formation of TPs in all the water matrices, seven of which were tentatively identified. The results obtained from the toxicity bioassays indicated that the toxicity originates from the DOM present in RE and its oxidation products formed during the photocatalytic treatment and not from the TPs resulted from the oxidation of OFX.

AB Pharmaceuticals are designed to improve human and animal health, but may also be a threat to freshwater ecosystems, particularly after receiving urban or wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Knowledge on the fate and attenuation of pharmaceuticals in engineered and natural ecosystems is rather fragmented, and comparable methods are needed to facilitate the comprehension of those processes amongst systems. In this study the dynamics of 8 pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ibuprofen, diclofenac, diazepam) and 11 of their transformation products were investigated in a WWTP and the associated receiving river ecosystem. During 3 days, concentrations of these compounds were quantified at the influents, effluents, and wastage of the WWTP, and at different distances downstream the effluent at the river. Attenuation (net balance between removal and release from and to the water column) was estimated in both engineered and natural systems using a comparable model-based approach by considering different uncertainty sources (e.g. chemical analysis, sampling, and flow measurements). Results showed that pharmaceuticals load reduction was higher in the WWTP, but attenuation efficiencies (as half-life times) were higher in the river. In particular, the load of only 5 out of the 19 pharmaceuticals was reduced by more than 90% at the WWTP, while the rest were only partially or non-attenuated (or released) and discharged into the receiving river. At the river, only the load of ibuprofen was reduced by more than 50% (out of the 6 parent compounds present in the river), while partial and non-attenuation (or release) was observed for some of their transformation products. Linkages in the routing of some pharmaceuticals (venlafaxine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and their corresponding transformation products were also identified at both WWTP and river. Finally, the followed procedure showed that dynamic attenuation in the coupled WWTP-river system could be successfully predicted with simple first order attenuation kinetics for most modeled compounds.

AB A simple method for the preparation of a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 (3D-rGO/Fe3O4) hybrid hydrogel was developed via the reduction of graphene oxide by ferrous ions and in situ simultaneous generation of tunable Fe3O4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets. After drying at 50 degrees C for 1 h, its mechanical strength was enhanced according to elastic modulus analysis. The hydrophilic and strength-enhanced hybrid was suitable for the removal of two typical pharmaceuticals including ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TC). Their adsorption kinetics, isotherms, pH and cation effects on 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 were studied. The adsorption capacities of 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 were 2.78 mmol g(-1) for CIP and 4.76 mmol g(-1) for TC according to the Langmuir fitting results, which are much higher than those of commercial granular activated carbons and other graphene-based hydrogels. Moreover, the spent 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 can be easily regenerated by Fenton-like catalytic oxidation with little loss of adsorption capacity after ten adsorption-oxidation cycles. The textural structure and surface functional groups on the adsorbent were hardly changed during the oxidative regeneration process. Benefiting from its superiority, both enhanced adsorption and catalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals were simultaneously achieved using this novel hybrid hydrogel, making it competitive in the removal of micropollutants from water or wastewater.
   Environmental significance A hydrophilic and strengthened 3D reduced graphene oxide/nano-Fe3O4 hybrid hydrogel was successfully prepared and it exhibited enhanced adsorption and catalytic oxidation of typical pharmaceuticals in water. This study provided a new strategy for the preparation of a graphene oxide-based granular adsorbent with high adsorption of micropollutants in water, and in particular, the loaded nano-Fe3O4 nanoparticles may catalytically oxidize the adsorbed pollutants in the regeneration process, achieving a combination of enhanced adsorption and in situ catalytic degradation of micropollutants on the hybrid adsorbent. This 3D-rGO/Fe3O4 adsorbent shows promising application for the removal of micropollutants from water or wastewater.

AB Iopromide is frequently detected in water bodies due to its widespread use as an X-ray contrast agent in medicine. Due to its rapid clearance from the human body and its incomplete removal by wastewater treatment, an elevation of its concentration in the environment is observed that might lead to a serious impact on human and environmental health. Alternative or additional removal technologies may be more effective to remove iopromide from the effluents of wastewater treatment facilities, like phytoremediation with aquatic macrophytes. To test this, a hydroponic experiment was carried out to assess the fate of iopromide in Typha latifolia. The transformation products (TPs) in the plant were investigated to predict possible transformation mechanisms. The removal process followed first order kinetics with a linear regression R-2 value of 0.983. The iopromide concentration in roots and rhizomes reached a maximum value of 20.70 +/- 0.81 and 16.82 +/- 1.78 nmol g(-1) on the 7th day, respectively, thereafter decreased until the end of experiment. A different result was found in leaves, where iopromide concentration decreased over the whole experimental period. A total of eight transformation products were detected in T. latifolia, including 23 isomers. The relative content of aldehyde and ketone TPs decreased in roots and rhizomes while the relative content of carboxylic TPs increased. However, the relative content of aldehyde and ketone TPs only showed a slight decrease in leaves while the relative content of carboxylic TPs remained stable during the experimental period. In addition, a significant increase of decarboxylated TPs was found in leaves, but not in roots and rhizomes. These results indicate that a difference in transformation mechanisms exists among plant tissues. The findings of this study are important to better understand the transformation mechanisms of iopromide in plants and to improve phytoremediation technologies for such kind of compounds.

AB A pilot-scale study was conducted to investigate the fate of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge. Of the 44 TrOCs monitored, 24 were detected in all primary sludge samples. Phase distribution of TrOCs was correlated well with their hydrophobicity (> 67% mass in the solid phase when LogD > 1.5). The pilot-scale anaerobic digester achieved a steady performance with a specific methane yield of 0.39-0.92 L/gVS(removed) and methane composition of 63-65% despite considerable variation in the primary sludge. The fate of TrOCs in the aqueous and solid phases was governed by their physicochemical properties. Biotransformation was significant (> 83%) for five TrOCs with logD < 1.5 and electron donating functional groups in molecular structure. The remaining TrOCs with logD < 1.5 were persistent and thus accumulated in the aqueous phase. Most TrOCs with logD > 1.5 were poorly removed under anaerobic conditions. Sorption onto the solid phase appears to impede the biodegradation of these TrOCs.

AB The occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals (trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, bezafibrate, ceftriaxone, and naproxen) in two west-flowing tropical rivers (Swarna and Nethravati) of southwestern India is reported for the first time. Water samples were collected during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons from river water end members and further downstream up to their confluence with the adjacent Arabian Sea. Samples were analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS. Results revealed that there were no significant seasonal variations in concentrations of target analytes in both the rivers. Of the total number of samples analyzed (n = 24), trimethoprim was detected in 100% of the samples, whereas sulfamethoxazole (SMX), chloramphenicol (CAP), ceftriaxone (CTX), and naproxen (NPX) were detected in between 91 and 58% of the samples. Bezafibrate (BZF) was not detected in the samples. Nethravathi river showed higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals than the Swarna river which may be attributed to comparatively larger human population in the basin. Possible impacts of PPCPs on aquatic life offer further scope for study.

AB In this study, a method for the simultaneous determination of two steroid hormones, 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3), and a hormone mimicking polycarbonate, bisphenol-A (BPA), wasdeveloped and validated. Thiswas thereafter used for the determination of the levels of the hormones in surface water collected around some livestock farms. The sensitivity of the method allowed the LODs and LOQs of the hormones and mimic hormone in the range 1.14-2.510 and 3.42-7.53 mu g/L, respectively. The results revealedwidevariability inthe concentrations ofE2andE3, whileBPAwas not detected at any of the sampling stations. The concentration of E3 ranged between < 1.14 and 45.5 mu g/L (N= 120) in station 2water. The highest concentrationofE2( 15.7 mu g/L, N= 80) wasobservedinwaterfrom station 1. The varied concentrations may be connected with the nature and sources of release, inconsistencies in analyte distribution due to dynamics of water flow pattern and the physical/chemical properties of the receiving water bodies.

AB Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is among the top 100 drugs prescribed annually in the United States and the United Kingdom and is one of many pharmaceutical products that have been detected in global surface waters. Our study used sublethal concentrations to assess the impact of FLX exposure on sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) locomotor behavior. Exposures lasted for 56 hours, and fish were recorded for locomotor behavior assessment at six timepoints between 1-56 h post-dose. Behavior was recorded to quantify locomotor activity using line crossing counts. Animals treated with 300 mu g L-1 FLX exhibited reduced locomotor activity at 1, 25, 32, 49 and 56 h post-dose. An EC25 value of 2 mu g L-1 (lower and upper 95 % confidence limits at 1.3, 43 mu g L-1, respectively) was determined for locomotor activity at 32 h of exposure. Changes in locomotor activity due to FLX exposure may have implications for the ecological response of populations to other natural and anthropogenic stressors.

AB We recently proposed how to expand the applicability of multimedia models towards polar organic chemicals by expressing environmental phase partitioning with the help of poly-parameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs). Here we elaborate on this approach by applying it to three pharmaceutical substances. A PP-LFER-based version of a Level III fugacity model calculates overall persistence, concentrations and intermedia fluxes of polar and non-polar organic chemicals between air, water, soil and sediments at steady-state. Illustrative modeling results for the pharmaceuticals within a defined coastal region are presented and discussed. The model results are highly sensitive to the degradation rate in water and the equilibrium partitioning between organic carbon and water, suggesting that an accurate description of this particular partitioning equilibrium is essential in order to obtain reliable predictions of environmental fate. The PP-LFER based modeling approach furthermore illustrates that the greatest mobility in aqueous phases may be experienced by pharmaceuticals that combines a small molecular size with strong H-acceptor properties.

AB The consumption of anticancer agents has increased in the recent decades, and these substances may be present in sewage. Consequently, they may reach the environment when sanitation infrastructure is ineffective. This study evaluated the toxicity of three anticancer agents-Tamoxifen (TAM), Cisplatin (CisPt), and Cyclophosphamide (CP)-on the development of embryos of the sand-dollar Mellita quinquiesperforata. Adult individuals were collected in sandy beaches, and gametes were obtained. Freshly-fertilized eggs were exposed to increasing sets of concentrations of each compound, and the effective concentrations needed to cause a 50% effect in the organisms (EC50) were calculated. The three compounds were toxic, and their EC50 values were 16.78 +/- 2.42 ng.L-1 (TAM), 27.20 +/- 38.26 ng.L-1 (CisPt), and 101.82 +/- 70.96 ng.L-1 (CP). There is no information on the environmental levels of these compounds in Brazil, but as they were already detected in ng.L-1 levels worldwide, it can be expected that these substances pose environmental risks to the marine biota.

AB Nowadays, waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as the pollution sources of nitrogen and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). In the present study, the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and typical PPCPs, ibuprofen and triclosan, was evaluated in a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3- hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) based solid-phase denitrification (SPD) system. Results after 602 days showed that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process occurred with average 83.85 +/- 13.09% NH4 (+) -N and 93.88 +/- 10.19% NO3- -N removals in the SPD system. Interestingly, the system achieved average 79.69 +/- 6.35% and 65.96 +/- 7.62% removals of ibuprofen and triclosan, respectively, under stable influent conditions of 50 mu g L-1. Cometabolic activities of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) probably played a role in the biodegradation of the two PPCPs. Illumina MiSeq sequencing results revealed that microbial composition enhanced the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and PPCPs in the SPD system.

AB Kuwait is a country with low rainfall and highly concentrated industrial and domestic effluents entering its coastal waters. These can be both treated and untreated. In this study we sampled a series of coastal and open-sea sites and used a variety of analyses to identify those sites requiring the most attention. We used a high throughput GC-MS screen to look for over 1000 chemicals in the samples. Estrogen and androgen screens assessed the potential to disrupt endocrine activity. An oyster embryo development screen was used to assess biological effect potential. The chemical screen identified sites which had high numbers of identified industrial and domestic chemicals. The oyster screen showed that these sites had also caused high levels of developmental abnormalities with 100% of embryos affected at some sites. The yeast screen showed that estrogenic chemicals were present in outfalls at 2-3 ng/l E2 equivalent, and detectable even in some open water sites. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was studied in three lab-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) systems; a single-stage mesophilic, a single-stage thermophilic and a two-stage thermophilic/mesophilic. All micropollutants underwent microbial degradation. High removal efficiency (> 80%) was calculated for diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen; whereas triclosan, bisphenol A and the sum of nonylphenol (NP), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO) and nonylphenol diethoxylate were moderately removed (40-80%). NSAIDs removal was not affected by the type of AD system used; whereas slightly higher EDCs removal was observed in two-stage system. In this system, most microcontaminants were removed in thermophilic digester. Biotransformation of NP1EO and NP was affected by the temperature applied to bioreactors. Under mesophilic conditions, higher removal of NP1EO and accumulation of NP was noticed; whereas the opposite was observed under thermophilic conditions. For most analytes, higher specific removal rates were calculated under thermophilic conditions and 20 days SRT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for selective adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ) in aqueous solution was synthesized by precipitation polymerization using CBZ as a template molecule and methacrylic acid (MM) as a functional monomer. The performance of the CBZ-MIP was evaluated in terms of selectivity, adsorption capacity, binding characteristics, loading volume, and elution volume. The CBZ-MIP exhibited a high affinity for CBZ over the competitive compound (Diclofenac) and was more suitable to remove low concentrations of CBZ in large-volume water samples. A binding performance experiment indicated that the adsorption of CBZ-MIP was characterized by both specific and non-specific binding interactions. Moreover, the regenerability of the MIP was affirmed in ten sequential cycles of adsorption/desorption without a significant loss in recovery. Finally, the CBZ-MIP was applied to enrich CBZ in environmental water samples, and the CBZ concentrations were subsequently determined using HPLC-UV. The results were in good agreement with corresponding LC-MS/MS data. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceuticals acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine, and herbicide atrazine are among the most highly manufactured compounds in the world and are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Much uncertainty exists regarding the impacts of the pharmaceuticals on non-target aquatic resources, while more is known about atrazine. Reduction of residues of each chemical in surface water will reduce the exposures that organisms experience in the surface water environment, thus reducing unknown risks. This project evaluated the potential use of two aquatic plant species (Acorus gramineus and Canna hybrida Orange Punch') for reducing concentrations of the chemicals in water. Concentrations of each contaminant in solution were reduced in the presence of the plants after 14days of exposure, in (acetaminophen 64-100%, atrazine 32-51%, carbamazepine 26-49%, sulfamethoxazole 41-60%). Results indicate that these plants have potential for reducing concentrations of these chemicals in surface water, but that plant- and chemical-specific properties prevent making generalizations regarding the extent and pathways for dissipation.

AB Pharmaceutical waste sludge harbors large amounts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and it is necessary to study the reduction of ARGs and MGEs during sludge treatment. Therefore, the antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes of enterococci, and the ARGs and MGEs in genomic DNA were investigated during anaerobic digestion (AD) with microwave (MW), thermal hydrolysis (TH) and ozone pretreatment. Results showed that sludge pretreatment increased the occurrence of the resistance phenotypes and genotypes of enterococci. During AD, the resistance of enterococci to macrolides decreased, except for in the MW-pretreated sludge. Horizontal gene transfer and co-occurrence of ermB and tetM in enterococci resulted in increased tetracycline resistance of enterococci throughout the sludge treatment. MGEs such as intI1, ISCR1 and Tn916/1545 had a significant effect on the distribution of ARGs. AD with pretreatment, especially TH pretreatment, resulted in greater ARGs and MGEs reduction and improved methane production. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study provides a first estimate of the sources, distribution, and risk presented by emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in coastal waters off southwestern Taiwan. Ten illicit drugs, seven nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), five antibiotics, two blood lipid regulators, two antiepileptic drugs, two UV filters, caffeine, atenolol, and omeprazole were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Thirteen EOCs were detected in coastal waters, including four NSAIDs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and codeine), three antibiotics (ampicillin, erythromycin, and cefalexin), three illicit drugs (ketamine, pseudoephedrine, and MDMA), caffeine, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil. The median concentrations for the 13 EOCs ranged from 1.47 ng/L to 156 ng/L.

AB This study investigated the removal of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a simulated managed aquifer recharge (MAR) system. The PPCPs included antibiotic, antiepileptic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and antilipidemic drugs, contrast media, herbicides, and stimulants. We first monitored the occurrence and fate of 22 PPCPs at a water reclamation facility (WRF) in Korea, and found carbamazepine and primidone were not readily removed (below 25% removal in average) by the WRF. This reclaimed water passed through a laboratory-scale soil column set-up at 0.5 m/d over one year, simulating MAR system. Atenolol, propranolol, and trimethoprim exhibited higher removal rates (> 80%) than other PPCPs through the simulated MAR, while atrazine, carbamazepine, lincomycin, primidone, and sulfamethazine were not readily removed, exhibiting removal rates below 20%. It can be efficient to monitor and manage these recalcitrant compounds at MAR systems to improve water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater recharge using reclaimed water is considered a promising method to alleviate groundwater depletion. However, pollutants in reclaimed water could be recharged into groundwater during this process, thereby posing a risk to groundwater and human health. In this study, 12 cities in northern China were selected for reclaimed water and groundwater sampling. Analysis of the samples revealed the presence of nine pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and five endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). In reclaimed water, all the PPCPs and EDCs were found, with sulpiride (SP) and estriol (E3) being most frequently detected. In groundwater samples, only ketoprofen (RP), mefenamic acid (MA), nalidixic acid (NA) and SP were detected among PPCPs, while bisphenol-A (BPA) was dominant among the target EDCs. The risk quotients (RQs) of all target PPCPs and EDCs except 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and E3 were below 1 in groundwater samples, indicating that EE2 and E3 deserve priority preferential treatment before recharging.

AB Antibiotic molecules have been reported among the xenobiotics present at trace levels in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and aquatic environment. Lincomycin, one of the most used in clinical practices whose presence in the STP effluents has been often documented, is submitted to an extensive investigation to assess its persistence in the environment and toxicity towards different algal strains. The possibility to remove the lincomycin from water by means of ozonation is demonstrated and a reduction of toxicity of ozonated solutions on S. leopoliensis, with respect to untreated solutions containing this compound, is obtained even just for 1 h of treatment. Kinetic constants for the attack to lincomycin of ozone (from 1.53 X 10(5)M(-1) s(-1) at pH = 3.0 and 4.93 x 105 M-1 s-1 at pH = 6.7) and OH radicals (4.37 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH = 5.5 and 4.59 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH = 7.5) are also evaluated.

AB Photo-treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals in effluents is a topic currently under discussion. In some countries effluents from hospitals are directly emitted into open ditches without any further treatment and with very little dilution. Under such circumstances photo-degradation in the environment can occur. However, photo-degradation does not necessarily end up with the complete mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, photo-product biodegradability and toxicity against environmental bacteria is of interest. Hospital effluents have often a pH around 9. Therefore, photo-oxidation (150 W medium-pressure Hg-lamp, batch reactor) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) was studied at pH 9. The primary elimination of CIP was monitored and structures of photo-products were assessed by liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Five compounds were identified as probable products of photo-defluorination, -decarboxylation and loss of the piperazine moiety. These photo-products were not biodegradable in the Closed Bottle test - OECD 301 D. They did not affect Vibrio fisheri in the applied concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drugs, i.e. active ingredients of human medicinal products, may be introduced into the environment after use in patients by sewage effluent pathways and consequently are detected at low concentrations in sewage effluents and in surface waters. Legal requirements in a number of geographical regions (Europe, US, and intended in Canada) demand environmental risk assessments (ERA) for new drug substances. Existing regulatory concepts of ERA are based initially on a set of short-term ecotoxicological studies in three to four different species, environmental behavior and the application of assessment factors to correct for the ERA inherent uncertainty. Based on theoretical considerations and the experience with a very limited, but well investigated, number of examples while considering that drugs are highly biologically active compounds, the appropriateness of this risk assessment procedure for all drug substances might be questioned. Indeed, e.g. long-term effects may occur at much lower concentrations and follow different toxicodynamic mechanism than extrapolated from short-term studies., In such cases, the application of assessment factors for deriving chronic no-observed effect concentration (NOECs) appears to be problematic. Although long-term tests with a variety of organisms would provide a complete database for the evaluation of the environmental risks, this is unachievable for all drugs due to time, money and animal welfare constraints. In order to avoid unnecessary testing, a concept is presented, which makes use of pharmacological and toxicological, as well as pharmaco- and toxicokinetic information derived from mammals during drug substance development. Useful data for adoption in a case-by-case testing strategy can be obtained by evaluating (a) the pharmacological activity, which indicates specific targets in mammalian species and may allow for an analysis, whether a similar target is available in aquatic species; (b) the mammalian toxicity, which may indicate, which targets are most susceptible to adverse effects; (c) the difference between acute and chronic effects in mammals, since the magnitude of this difference may indicate, whether long-term effects are expected at significantly lower levels than acute effects; (d) the (pharmacologically and toxicologically) effective plasma levels in mammalian test organisms, which may be compared with the relevant exposure scenario for the environment. Additionally, activity classes of compounds may be established based on experience with specific substances, in order to develop an appropriate test strategy. The above preliminary considerations should support decisions on the selection of candidate substances for chronic effects studies and for the appropriate selection of test species and endpoints to monitor. Generally. ecologically relevant endpoints such as impairment of growth, development and reproduction should be used to assess the ecotoxicologic effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB This study evaluated gamma radiation-enhanced sulfamethazine (SMT) degradation, which belongs to the heterocyclic sulfonamides, in different conditions in aqueous solution. The results showed that gamma irradiation could increase the SMT removal in aqueous solution, and the SMT degradation kinetic follow the modified pseudo-first-order kinetic. The degradation rate was nearly 95% at the absorbed dose of 4 kGy. The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) could be also induced. When the radiation dose was 5 kGy, the removal rates were only about 6.8% and 10.5% for TOC and TN, respectively. Some ions including HCOO-, CH3COO- and SO42- released during SMT degradation were studied. The biodegradability and toxicity of intermediate products of the SMT degradation were also proposed in this experiment. The biodegradability of the SMT can be improved by the intermediate products of SMT degradation at the radiation dose of 1, 2 and 5 kGy. Gamma radiation could be used as a pretreatment technology before the biodegradation process of pharmaceutical waste water.

AB Occurrence and removal of 81 representative Pharmaceutical Active Compounds (PhACs) were assessed in a municipal WWTP located in a highly industrialized area, with partial water reuse after UV tertiary treatment and discharge to a Mediterranean river. Water monitoring was performed in an integrated way at different points in the WWTP and river along three seasons.
   Consistent differences between therapeutic classes were observed in terms of influent concentration, removal efficiencies and seasonal variation. Conventional (primary and secondary) treatment was unable to completely remove numerous compounds and UV-based tertiary treatment played a complementary role for some of them. Industrial activity influence was highlighted in terms of PhACs presence and seasonal distribution.
   Even if global WWTP effluent impact on the studied river appeared to be minor, PhACs resulted widespread pollutants in river waters. Contamination can be particularly critical in summer in water scarcity areas, when water flow decreases considerably. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photochemical behaviour of the four pharmaceuticals, atorvastatin, carbamazepine, levofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole in sunlit surface water was investigated. These compounds, which have been observed or have the potential to be in surface waters, were susceptible to direct and indirect photodegradation. Several photoproducts are identified using authentic standards, and structures of other degradation products are proposed based on mass spectral information from this and previous studies. The same degradation compounds are formed from direct and indirect photolysis, suggesting the same photoproducts are formed by alternate pathways. The natural water constituents nitrate, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and bicarbonate influence the elimination rates of the pharmaceuticals differently. Since direct photolysis appears important in limiting the persistence of levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, the presence of humic matter decreases degradation rates. The same constituent has an opposite and positive effect on the elimination rates of atorvastatin and carbamazepine and thus, photosensitization reactions or photooxidants generated from DOM photolysis are important. Products resulting from direct and indirect photolysis also seem to be susceptible to photodegradation, suggesting they will not persist in sunlit aqueous systems.

AB A novel hierarchical porous starch-chitosan-UiO-66-COOH composite for the treatment of pharmaceutical bearing sewage was developed. UiO-66-COOH-type carboxylic zirconium metal organic framework (Zr-MOF) was synthesized and immobilized within porous starch through a facile chitosan-adhesive strategy. The porous starch offered a stable macro-porous structural skeleton to accommodate the UiO-66-COOH nanoparticles, and chitosan played the role of an affinity agent to strengthen the decoration effect via electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding with carboxylic Zr-MOF particles and porous starch, respectively. The carboxylic Zr-MOF composite not only preserved the intrinsic accessibility of UiO-66-COOH but also maintained unique crystallization and thermal properties. The adsorption of sulfanilamide into the porous starch-chitosan-UiO-66-COOH composite conformed to pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isothermic models, demonstrating that adsorptions could be considered as homogeneous monolayer chemisorption. The Zr-O group within the carboxylic Zr-MOF composite displayed high affinity for sulfanilamide and possibly played a crucial role in sulfanilamide adsorption.

AB The adsorption behavior of pharmaceuticals and personal care product, Bisphenol-A (BPA), according to four coal-based and four wood-based granular activated carbons modified using outgassing treatment, acidic treatment or alkaline treatment was studied. The adsorption isotherm results indicated that carbon surface acidity played a very important role in the adsorption of BPA. It was found that increasing surface acidity would increase the hydrogen bonding effects and increase adsorption of BPA on activated carbon. The acidic modified sample (F600-A and OLC-A) represented the best adsorption capacity, and the equilibrium adsorption amounts reached 346.42 and 338.55 mg/g, respectively. Further, effects of surface charge and surface basicity were examined. It was found that the adsorbed amount of BPA decreased with the increase of surface charge. Finally, there appeared to be a significant oligomerization phenomenon with BPA molecules onto the surface of activated carbon. OLC and OLC-OG, which have higher micropore percentages, are very effective in hampering the oligomerization of BPA under oxic conditions.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption and degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) at mu g/L range in an aerobic activated sludge system. The sorption isotherms and thermodynamics indicated that the sorption of BPA on sludge was mainly a physical process in which partitioning played a dominating role. The values of sorption coefficient K-oc were between 621 and 736 L/kg in the temperature range of 10-30 degrees C. Both mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) and temperature influenced BPA sorption on sludge. The degradation of BPA by acclimated activated sludge could be described by first-order reaction equation with the first-order degradation rate constant of 0.80 h(-1) at 20 degrees C. The decrease of initial COD concentration and the increase of MLSS concentration and temperature enhanced BPA degradation rate. The removal of BPA in the activated sludge system was characterized by a quick sorption on the activated sludge and subsequent biodegradation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A procedure based on microwave assisted extraction for the determination of 6 pharmaceuticals in samples of Lavandula dentata, Salicornia ramosissima and Juncus sp. by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) was optimized and validated. Best results were obtained using microwave assisted extraction of 1.0 g of homogeneous lyophilized samples and 5 mL of a mixture ACN: H2O (1: 1 v/v) as extracting solvent. Analytical recoveries ranged from 60 to 107% with relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 15%. Limits of quantitation (LOQ) for the 6 pharmaceuticals flumequine (FLM), carbamazepine (CBZ), ciprofloxacin (CPR), enrofloxacin (ENR), diclofenac (DCL), and ibuprofen (IBU) were in the range 20.8-125 ng g(-1). The method was satisfactory applied for an uptake study in Lavandula dentata samples finding quantifying concentrations of FLM and CBZ in roots, leaf and stem. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human activities have contaminated water sources with pharmaceutical compounds by the improper disposal of unwanted medicine or through sewage waste. The search for the most effective water treatment processes has been ongoing for decades. In the current paper, by exposing water to non-thermal plasma in a floating electrode streamer corona discharge (FESCD) system, both the antidepressant compound fluoxetine and the antihypertensive compound propranolol are eliminated. After 3 h of plasma treatment, more than 99% of each contaminant was degraded. The energy yield, which is the amount of contaminants degraded using 1 kWh of energy, was in the range of 0.12-0.13 g/kWh. The degree of mineralization calculated from total organic carbon (TOC) measurements was 60% and 17% for fluoxetine and propranolol, respectively. Reaction with hydroxyl radicals was the only degradation pathway for fluoxetine and its byproducts. For propranolol, hydroxyl radicals primarily caused the degradation butoxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones suggested the possible role of ozone molecules.

AB The aquatic environment is becoming increasingly contaminated with pharmaceuticals. Salicylic acid (SA), which can be used individually or appear as a degradation product of the widely used acetylsalicylic acid was chosen for testing. Juvenile zebrafish Danio rerio were subjected to OECD test No. 215 (fish, juvenile growth test) with salicylic acid concentrations of 0.004; 0.04; 0.4; 4 and 40 mg/L. Specific growth rate (SGR), histological changes, and parameters of oxidative stress were evaluated. SA had no effects on histological changes, SGR, glutathione reductase, and lipid peroxidation. Increased catalytic activity of GPx was found at 0.04 mg/L compared to control, increased catalytic activity of catalase was found at 0.04 and 4 mg/L compared to control, and increased catalytic activity of glutathione-S-transferase was found at 0.004 and 0.04 mg/L compared to control (P < 0.05). Juvenile zebrafish turned out to be relatively insensitive to both environmentally relevant (0.004 mg/L) and higher concentrations of salicylic acid.

AB Pyrolysis of meat and bone meal material has been studied in an auto-thermal pilot scale unit with a fluidised bed reactor based on Bioware Technology. The heating value of the bio-oil samples is around 33-36 MJ/kg, whilst the nitrogen content is between 7.3 wt.% and 9.0 wt.%. Liquid fractionation with solvents of the bio-oil has been carried out. Chemical analyses of the fractions have shown that the main components in the bio-oil samples are alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated components (as alcohols) and nitrogen compounds (as nitriles) which are identified in the water insoluble fraction. Knowing the chemical composition of the bio-oils is important for assessing possible chemical and pharmaceutical applications of these bio-oils. The char samples have a notable ash content (63 wt.% to 77 wt.%) and its high Ca content could make it suitable for use as a catalyst in gasification processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media have been detected in hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant effluent, rivers and groundwater aquifers. No process has been developed to remove triiodinated aromatic molecules. In this paper, we present a biological sequential process using an anaerobic fixed-bed reactor coupled in series with an aerobic fixed-bed reactor for degrading 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid (ATIA), the core structure of a X-ray contrast media family The results obtained showed that the coupled reactor eliminated up to 870 + 44 mg of carbon L-1 day(-1), with a molar ethanol/ATIA ratio of 4 in the feeding medium. The anaerobic reactor (ANR) undertook the majority of the deiodination of the aromatic nucleus and had a maximum deiodination rate of 23.4 +/- 0.06 mM day(-1). The aerobic reactor (AER) mineralized ATIA and was also able to eliminate its metabolites. This study suggests that the mineralization of ATIA can be achieved efficiently in a coupled anaerobic-aerobic bioreactor. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper presents an analysis of measured riverine concentrations of 16 common organic water contaminants. From observed concentrations we back-calculate emissions and chemical half lives through a simple inverse model. The analysis does not allow identifying a single half life/emission factor combination, but a set of combinations which are Pareto-optimal (or "non-dominated"). The approach is shown to provide a rational basis for the screening of chemicals in rivers: with reference to the 16 chemicals considered here, estimated emission factors and half lives are consistent with the ones reported in other studies. For more precise estimates, prior knowledge about either emission factors or half lives is necessary. For the considered chemicals, loads to European seas can be subsequently estimated with an uncertainty usually within a factor of 2. The approach can be proposed for the inventorying of catchment-specific chemical pollutant emissions required for European environmental policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are an increasing concern, since the improvement of analytical tools has enabled the detection of parent compounds, metabolites and transformation products of a wide range of pharmaceuticals. These micro-pollutants might compromise the water quality and therefore might become a risk for the environment in general and particularly for humans. Major concerns are for example antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to control infections with pathogenic bacteria. Excessive utilization of non-degradable antibiotics by human patients or in farm animals might lead to accumulation in the water compartment and subsequently to the promotion of resistance development when wide areas containing relevant bacteria have sufficient concentrations of active antibiotics leading to a constant selection pressure on the bacteria. Therefore, it would be attractive to develop a new generation of biodegradable antibiotics, which would rapidly disintegrate into innoxious and in the best case inorganic molecules such as water, carbonate, nitrate and alike in sewage treatment plants or surface water. The guiding principle is the "benign by design" concept. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, quantitative interspecies-toxicity relationship methodologies were used to improve the prediction power of interspecies toxicity model. The most relevant descriptors selected by stepwise multiple linear regressions and toxicity of chemical to Daphnia magna were used to predict the toxicities of chemicals to fish. Modeling methods that were used for developing linear and nonlinear models were multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The obtained results indicate the superiority of SVM model over other models. Robustness and reliability of the constructed SVM model were evaluated by using the leave-one-out cross-validation method (Q(2)=0.69, SPRESS= 0.822) and Y-randomization test (R-2=0.268 for 30 trail). Furthermore, the chemical applicability domains of these models were determined via leverage approach. The developed SVM model was used for the prediction of toxicity of 46 compounds that their experimental toxicities to a fish were not being reported earlier from their toxicities to D. magna and relevant molecular descriptors.

AB In this work, abatement of diuron (D), (selected as an example of priority pollutant) and nicotine (N), caffeine (C), ibuprofen (I) and phenacetin (P), (chosen as examples of target emerging pollutants), have been carried out by using persulfate activated by Fe2+. Reactions were accomplished at room temperature in a batch or semicontinuous (SC) manner, using 5 mg/L of each pollutant.
   The effectiveness of the process was measured by attending at the pollutant conversion and TOC removal. Kinetic model for both reaction rates - pollutants oxidation and mineralization - was developed - on the basis of a radicalic mechanism and kinetic parameters calculated. Moreover, the kinetic model discriminated was successfully validated by comparison of predicted and experimental values obtained for pollutant and TOC conversion when mixtures of pollutants were treated at different persulfate and iron concentrations. Iron addition process presented a remarkable effect on oxidation results. It was found that a continuous slow release of Fe2+ notably increased the efficiency of the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB In February 2011, at the peak of an influenza outbreak, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mass balances of four anti-influenza drugs-oseltamivir (OS), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), amantadine (AMN), and zanamivir (ZAN)-in the urban area of the Yodo River system. This area includes three main river catchments (the Katsura, Uji, and Kidzu Rivers) and is home to 12 million people, about 10% of Japan's population. Water was sampled at six main rivers and 13 tributary sites and eight sewage treatment plants (STPs). We concluded that the STP effluents were the major sources of the anti-influenza drug load in the Yodo River system (68-94% of total mass fluxes). Extended measurement throughout the Yodo River system further showed only small fluctuations of the ratio of OS to OC from 0.2 to 0.3, suggesting that OS and its metabolite are environmentally stable. The results also clearly showed the importance of reducing the levels of anti-influenza drugs in the water environment by reducing their emission at STPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. Our study focuses on the indication of anthropogenic impacts on the urban surface and groundwater in large cities, demonstrated for the cities of Halle/Saale and Leipzig (Germany). For the study we selected indicator substances such as xenobiotics, trace elements, and stable isotopes which are connected to human activities in urban areas. The xenobiotics reported here are the pharmaceutical carbamacepine, the polycylic musk compounds galaxolide and tonalide, the life style product caffeine, and industrial chemicals such as bisphenol A and t-nonylphenol. The investigated xenobiotics pose largely unknown risks to human health and the aquatic ecosystem. Trace elements are represented by the rare earth element gadolinium (Gd), used as magnetic resonance imaging contrast substance. Nitrogen isotopes in dissolved nitrate characterize the origin of nitrogen compounds, mixing and reaction processes.
   Methodology. River water was sampled along the flow path of the rivers Saale and Weisse Elster through the city of Halle/Saale, the rivers Luppe and Weisse Elster through the city of Leipzig. Separate samples were collected from the effluent of the local waste water treatment plants. Groundwater from Quaternary plain aquifers along the rivers and from different urban locations was collected at the same time. The indicators were analysed and assessed according to their sources, concentration and distribution patterns.
   Results and Discussion. Based on the nitrogen isotopic signature, dissolved nitrate in river water of the Saale was referred mainly to two sources: the effluent of the water treatment plant and a mixture of diffusive inputs from rain water channels, sewage leakages and agriculture activities along the rivers. The Gd anomaly was recognized in surface water of both cities, particularly in the effluent of the water treatment plants, but clearly attenuated in groundwater. We measured concentrations of xenobiotics in river and sewer water between 10 and 60,000 ng L-1, and, in groundwater, one order of magnitude lower. Distinctions of xenobiotic patterns were found in river water before and after the effluent of treated waste water into the rivers. Degradation of endocrine disrupters and fragrances, but also persistence of carbamacepine were recognized as essential processes during waste water treatment. At the study site Halle/Saale, mass balances were set up for xenobiotics and water fluxes.
   Conclusions. At both sites, we demonstrated that indicators such as xenobiotics, gadolinium, and nitrogen isotopes are suitable for assessing anthropogenic impacts on urban water. However, the behaviour of these indicators in surface and groundwater has to be considered according to the different geochemical environments.

AB Intensive land development as a result of the rapidly growing tourism industry in the "Riviera Maya" region of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico may result in contamination of groundwater resources that eventually discharge into Caribbean coastal ecosystems. We deployed two types of passive sampling devices into groundwater flowing through cave systems below two communities to evaluate concentrations of contaminants and to indicate the possible sources. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products accumulated in the samplers could only have originated from domestic sewage. PAHs indicated contamination by runoff from highways and other impermeable surfaces and chlorophenoxy herbicides accumulated in samplers deployed near a golf course indicated that pesticide applications to turf are a source of contamination. Prevention and mitigation measures are needed to ensure that expanding development does not impact the marine environment and human health, thus damaging the tourism-based economy of the region.

AB An enormous quantity of pharmacologically active principles are currently being introduced into the environment, with consequent escalation of environmental problems, but only a small number of studies are focusing on an assessment of their genotoxic effects. The aim of this article is to assess the genotoxic effects of erythromycin, lincomycin, and of a combination of these two antibiotics on the genome of the zebrafish. The genotoxicity of the two antibiotics was assessed by applying the micronucleus test to erythrocytes and performing a Comet assay on erythrocytes and hepatocytes. The fish were exposed to antibiotics at different concentrations and times of exposure, under standard laboratory conditions. Depending on the different experimental conditions, erythromycin and lincomycin induced a significant increase in DNA migration (tail moment) and a significant increase in micronuleus frequency. We also conducted an analysis on the activation of repair mechanisms when the genotoxic agent was removed. Only a few of the cells displayed a decrease in damage under these test conditions.(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 2012.

AB Fluoroquinolone (FQ) derivatives with environmental friendliness regarding photodegradation, bioconcentration, and genotoxicity were selected from our previous works so that their transformation pathways of biological metabolism, photodegradation, microbial degradation, and chlorination disinfection could be studied. The pathways of these molecules and their derivatives were simulated to investigate the genotoxicity of their transformation products. The results showed that the genotoxicity of the biological metabolites, photodegradation products, and microbial degradation products of the maternal FQ derivatives partially increased, whereas the disinfection by-products exhibited lower genotoxicity than their precursors. Some designed FQ molecular derivatives still had potential environmental risks in biological metabolism, photodegradation, and microbial degradation. This study demonstrated that it is necessary to take into account the potential environmental risks of the transformed products of the modified FQs molecules during biometabolism, photodegradation, microbial degradation, and chlorination processes when designing novel FQ molecules. In future studies, assessing the potential environmental risks during various artificial or natural processes can be applied to screen environmentally friendly novel FQ molecules to avoid and or reduce their threat to environmental and human health.

AB Three activated carbon coated titanium dioxide composites are evaluated as adsorbents for the removal of three pharmaceutical compounds: clofibric, gallic and salicylic acids from aqueous solutions. These composite materials are characterized by several techniques as SEM, FT-IR, TGA and point of zero charge determination. The adsorption mechanism of acids was investigated and compared to the adsorption on the virgin carbon. The analysis of adsorption isotherms and kinetic properties reveals that the addition of TiO2 increased the adsorption capacities of the initial material. The adsorption kinetics has been studied in terms of pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetic models, and the Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, Toth and Sips isotherms models have also been applied to the equilibrium adsorption data. The analysis of results indicated that the adsorption of acids on the activated carbon-titanium dioxide composites is well described by the pseudo-first order kinetic model and the Sips isotherm equation fitted the sorption experimental results better than other models.

AB This study demonstrates the robustness and treatment capacity of a forward osmosis (FO)-membrane distillation (MD) hybrid system for small-scale decentralized sewer mining. A stable water flux was realized using a laboratory-scale FO-MD hybrid system operating continuously with raw sewage as the feed at water recovery up to 80%. The hybrid system also showed an excellent capacity for the removal of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), with removal rates ranging from 91 to 98%. The results suggest that TrOC transport through the FO membrane is governed by "solute-membrane" interaction, whereas that through the MD membrane is strongly correlated to TrOC volatility. Concentrations of organic matter and TrOCs in the draw solution increased substantially as the water recovery increased. This accumulation of some contaminants in the draw solution is attributed to the difference in their rejection by the FO and MD systems. We demonstrate that granular activated carbon adsorption or ultraviolet oxidation could be used to prevent contaminant accumulation in the draw solution, resulting in near complete rejection (>99.5%) of TrOCs.

AB The aim of this work consists in evaluating the influence of carmabazepine (CBZ) (i) on the endogenous and exogenous respirations, in batch reactors, of bacterial populations taken from a conventional activated sludge process (CAS) and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) and (ii) on COD removal, sludge production and oxygen requirement of a lab-sale MBR system. In batch experiments, the increase in endogenous oxygen needs suggests an increase in maintenance requirements, essentially to manage the chemical stress induced by the CBZ presence. The decrease of exogenous oxygen needs seems to suggest a change in the metabolic pathways of the substrate or a change in the active bacterial species. However, in spite of these momentary changes, no inhibition is observed in the presence of CBZ in the test tank. This result is confirmed by the MBR experiment where no significant difference COD removal, sludge production and oxygen requirement is observed, with and without CBZ. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging contaminants have been considered one of the main concerns for ensuring the quality of water around the world. This work presents the results of 10 years of analyses carried out in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil) that has the high population density and intense agricultural and industrial activities. In this work 58 compounds (9 hormones, 14 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, 8 industrial compounds, 17 pesticides and 10 illicit drugs) were determined from 2006 to 2015 in 708 samples including raw and treated sewage, surface and ground and drinking waters. A preliminary risk assessment for aquatic life protection identified potential risks for caffeine, paracetamol, diclofenac, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, estrone, testosterone, triclosan, 4-n-nonylphenol, bisphenol A, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, fipronil, imidacloprid, malathion and tebuconazole. Drinking water criteria were available only for 22 compounds and for them no adverse effects were expected at the concentrations found, except for 17 beta-estradiol.

AB Ultrasonic and ozone pre-treatment technologies were employed in this study to improve the anaerobic digestion efficiency of pharmaceutical waste activated sludge. The sludge solubilisation achieved 30.01% (150,000 kJ/kg TS) and 28.10% (0.1 g O-3/g TS) after ultrasonic treatment and ozone treatment. The anaerobic biodegradability after ultrasonic treatment was higher compared to ozonation due to the higher cumulative methane volume observed after 6 days (249 ml vs 190 ml). The ozonated sludge released the highest concentration of Cu2+ into the liquid phase (6.640 mg L-1) compared to 0.530 mg/L for untreated sludge and 0.991 mg/L for sonicated sludge. The acute toxicity test measured by luminescent bacteria showed that anaerobic digestion could degrade toxic compounds and result in a reduction in toxicity. The main mechanism of action led to some differences in the treated sludge exhibiting higher potential for methane production from pharmaceutical waste sludge with ultrasonic treatment.

AB This first report describes the purification and identification of an orange-red pigment produced by Achromobacter denitrificans strain SP1 (isolated from sewage sludge heavily contaminated with plastics) during its growth in a simple basal salt medium supplemented with the hazardous di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) blended in PVC blood bag (in situ) or free DEHP (ex situ) as carbon source. The cell-bound pigment was elucidated, characterized at molecular level, and described as an unusual 25C prodigiosin analog for the first time. At laboratory conditions (in flasks), the dry cell mass was 75.2 mg/g blood bag, which upon extraction yielded 7.1 mg prodigiosin; at this stage the pH of the medium was dropped from 7.2 to 3.5. Considering its pharmaceutical importance, taking 10 known prodigiosins as controls, this 25C prodigiosin was subjected to molecular docking studies, showed comparable and promising binding efficiencies with the crucial molecular human targets like cycloxygenase-2, ZAP-70 kinase and Jak-3 kinase.

AB Ninety eight pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds (POOCs) that were amended to samples of chlorinated drinkingwater were extracted and analyzed 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 days after amendment to determine whether the total chlorine residual reacted with the amended POOCs in drinking water in a time frame similar to the residence time of drinking water in a water distribution system.
   Results indicated that if all 98 were present in the finished drinking water from a drinking-water treatment plant using free chlorine at 1.2 mg/L as the distribution system disinfectant residual, 52 POOCs would be present in the drinking water after 10 days at approximately the same concentration as in the newly finished drinking water. Concentrations of 16 POOCs would be reduced by 32% to 92%, and 22 POOCs would react completely with residual chlorine within 24 h. Thus, the presence of free chlorine residual is an effective means for transforming some POOCs during distribution. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An in vivo bioassay for vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis was developed to screen individual chemicals or mixtures of chemicals for potentially estrogenic effects in a marine teleost model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantitate VTG synthesis in male sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) exposed to five concentrations of the natural estrogen (17 beta-estradiol), a synthetic, steroidal pharmaceutical estrogen (17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol), or a synthetic, non-steroidal, pharmaceutical estrogen (diethylstilbestrol) for 16 days. At an exposure concentration of 20 ng/l, only diethystilbestrol elicited a vitellogenic response. At all test concentrations greater than 100 ng/l, VTG appeared in the plasma in a dose-dependent manner for the three estrogen treatments. Liver VTG mRNA measurements were also made, exhibiting no clear correlations between quantities, nor temporal appearance of the message and mature protein were apparent. This assay is short-term relatively inexpensive, shows a direct response, and easily quantitated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) recently have been recognized to constitute a health risk for aquatic ecosystems. The major pathways of PhACs to enter the aquatic environment are excretion and discharge of effluents through sewage treatment plants (STPs). The occurrence, bioaccumulation and risk assessment of lipophilic PhACs, including erythromycin, ketoconazole, indomethacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, propranolol, carbamazepine, sertraline and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were investigated in a river that receives effluents from STP. The results indicate that the PhACs were extensively existed in fish, sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM), colloidal phase (5 kDa to 1 gm) and truly dissolved phase (< 5 kDa) water, with total concentration of ten PhACs (Sigma(10)PhACs) of ND-19.6 ng/g, 7.3-11.2 ng/g, 25.3-101.5 ng/g, 10.1-27.7 ng/L and 67.0-107.6 ng/L, respectively. The Sigma(10)PhACs for particulate and water samples collected from STP's outfall site were higher than those collected from upstream and downstream, indicating that the STP is an important PhACs source of river. However, the Sigma(10)PhACs in sediment showed no significant statistical differences in the sampling area, and which was 3.5-9.5 times lower than those in SPM samples. The colloidal phase contributed 2.5-28.5% of erythromycin, 5.8-45.6% of ketoconazole, 8.4-32.2% of indomethacin, 7.0-21.4% of diclofenac, 11.6-36.9% of gemfibrozil, 10.2-45.9% of bezafibrate, 5.9-16.8% of propranolol, 1.9-11.1% of carbamazepine and 1.1-23.8% of sertraline in the aquatic environment. This suggests that aquatic particulates (e.g., colloids and SPM) maybe an important carrier for PhACs in the aquatic system. In general, the Sigma(10)PhACs in the tissues of fish were in order as follows: kidney > brain > liver > gill > muscle. Based on truly dissolved concentrations of PhACs in the water, bioaccumulation factors were between 3.7 and 2727.3 in the fish tissues, sertraline exhibited bioaccumulation potential. In all the risk assessments, erythromycin could cause most harmful adverse health effects for the most sensitive algae group based on the acute and chronic data. In addition, the risk quotient values for diclofenac toward fish were higher than 1. These results indicate that the PhACs pose a potential risk to the aquatic organisms, especially for chronic risk.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is a pharmaceutical drug widely found in the aquatic environment, where it represents a persistent, anthropogenic hazard to all biota. Owing to the reported inefficiency of water treatment strategies to remove pharmaceuticals, the present study aimed to investigate the ability of the aquatic fungus Mucor hiemalis to take up and accumulate DCF. Cultures of M. hiemalis were exposed to varying concentrations of DCF (10, 25 and 50 mu g/L) over a period of 144h. In the presence of M. hiemalis, DCF concentrations in the media decreased by 95% within 24h. This early removal was most likely due to extracellular metabolism of DCF, as low proportions of the pharmaceutical were found in the mycelium of the fungus, thereby excluding bioaccumulation as the main mode of removal. However, adsorption of DCF onto the surface of the M. hiemalis pellets cannot be excluded. Our study provides the first report of DCF remediation using M.hiemalis and is the first successful step towards a feasible and inexpensive bioremediation technique for DCF.

AB Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed drugs globally, due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties. However, it is highly toxic at elevated doses, with involvement of an already described oxidative stress pathway. Despite this, the number of ecotoxicological studies on potential effects of paracetamol in wild organisms is still scarce. The present article presents a comprehensive series of standardized assays for the assessment of paracetamol effects in freshwater organisms. The results show that paracetamol toxicity is widely variable among species, even when these species are phylogenetically related. Furthermore, comparisons between data from the literature and our results reinforce this conclusion, providing evidence of the inadequacy of standardized toxicity testing guidelines for pharmaceutical compounds in wild organisms. Paracetamol toxicity can be modulated by unpredictable physiological conditions that might compromise extrapolations and comparisons of responsiveness among species. The ecological relevance of data obtained from classical tests for this compound is further discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing evidence indicates widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal effluent discharges and surface waters. Studies that characterize the fate and effects of PPCPs in aquatic systems are limited, and to our knowledge, data regarding pharmaceutical accumulation in fish of effluent-dominated ecosystems have not been previously reported. In the present study, fish populations were sampled from a reference stream and an effluent-dominated stream in north Texas, USA. Lepomis macrochirus, Ictalurus punctatus, Cyprinus carpio, and Pontoxis nigromaculatus were killed; the liver, brain, and lateral filet tissues dissected; and the tissues stored at -80degreesC until analysis. Fish tissues were extracted using solid-phase extraction and then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the negative chemical ionization mode. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline and the SSRI metabolites norfluoxetine and desmethylsertraline were detected at levels greater than 0.1 ng/g in all tissues examined from fish residing in a municipal effluent-dominated stream. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of SSRI residues in fish residing within municipal effluent-dominated systems.

AB This study evaluated the link between anaerobic bacterial diversity and, the biodegradation of antibiotic combinations and assessed how amending antibiotic combination and increasing concentration of antibiotics in a stepwise fashion influences the development of resistance genes in anaerobic reactors. The biodegradation, sorption and occurrence of the known antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of erythromycin and tetracycline were investigated using the processes of UV-HPLC and qPCR analysis respectively. Ion Torrent sequencing was used to detect microbial community changes in response to the addition of antibiotics. The overall results indicated that changes in the structure of a microbial community lead to changes in biodegradation capacity, sorption of antibiotics combinations and occurrence of ARGs. The enhanced biodegradation efficiency appeared to generate variations in the structure of the bacterial community. The results suggested that controlling the ultimate Gram-negative bacterial community, especially Acinetobacter-related populations, may promote the successful biodegradation of antibiotic combinations and reduce the occurrence of ARGs.

AB Adsorption on low-cost biochars would increase the affordability and availability of water treatment in, for example, developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the precursor materials and hydrochar surface properties that yield efficient removal of compounds of environmental concern (CEC). We determined the adsorption kinetics of a mixture containing ten CECs (octhilinone, triclosan, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxasole, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, paracetamol, diphenhydramine, fluconazole, and bisphenol A) to hydrochars prepared from agricultural waste (including tomato- and olive-press wastes, rice husks, and horse manure). The surface characteristics of the hydrochars were evaluated via diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2-adsorption. Kinetic adsorption tests revealed that removal efficiencies varied substantially among different materials. Similarly, surface analysis revealed differences among the studied hydrochars and the degree of changes that the materials undergo during carbonization. According to the DRIFTS data, compared with the least efficient adsorbent materials, the most efficient hydrochars underwent more substantial changes during carbonization.

AB Human exposure to emerging contaminants by indirect routes is of increasing interest. This study assessed the contamination of food by chemicals used in human pharmaceuticals (HPs), veterinary medicines (VMs), and personal care products (PCPs). A prioritization study was undertaken to identify the chemicals and food-producing scenarios most likely to result in contamination of food. Around 400 samples of mushrooms, vegetables, aquaculture products, and animal tissues were collected from sites in the United Kingdom, along with aquaculture products imported from Southeast Asia. A number of multianalyte methods were developed and validated for the analysis of the prioritized compounds in these samples. The analysis of all sample method combinations required approximately 18000 determinations. Around 325 individual residues, including parabens, musk compounds, and antibiotics, were detected in 118 individual samples, but mostly at low nanograms per gram concentrations. Results suggest that the limited contamination of target chemicals occurred in the realistic food-producing scenarios investigated.

AB Caffeine, a biologically active drug, is recognized as a contaminant of freshwater and marine systems. We quantified caffeine concentrations in Oregon's coastal ocean to determine whether levels correlated with proximity to caffeine pollution sources. Caffeine was analyzed at 14 coastal locations, stratified between populated areas with sources of caffeine pollution and sparsely populated areas with no major caffeine pollution sources. Caffeine concentrations were measured in major water bodies discharging near sampling locations. Caffeine in seawater ranged from below the reporting limit (8.5 ng/L) to 44.7 ng/L. Caffeine occurrence and concentrations in seawater did not correspond with pollution threats from population density and point and non-point sources, but did correspond with storm event occurrence. Caffeine concentrations in rivers and estuaries draining to the coast ranged from below the reporting limit to 152.2 ng/L. This study establishes the occurrence of caffeine in Oregon's coastal waters, yet relative importance of sources, seasonal variability, and processes affecting caffeine transport into the coastal ocean require further research.

AB Sertraline hydrochloride is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely prescribed to patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Pharmaceutical products such as sertraline have been identified in environmental waters. This study describes the evaluation of sertraline using a battery of freshwater species representing four trophic levels. The species most sensitive to sertraline were Daphnia magna 21 d reproduction test, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata 72 h growth inhibition, and Oncorhynchus mykiss 96 h mortality, with the Microtox assay being the least sensitive assay. The D. magna 21 d reproduction test was approximately two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the other bioassays. These results show the advantages of having a tiered approach within a test battery. The presented results indicate that sertraline hydrochloride adversely affects aquatic organisms at levels several orders of magnitude higher than that reported in municipal effluent concentrations, however adverse effects may result from lower concentration exposures, further research into chronic toxicity is therefore advocated.

AB Removal rates for pharmaceuticals and dyes have been modelled using so-called quasi-SMILES, which are representations of the above processes. Quasi-SMILES is an extend of the simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) where, in addition to information on the molecular structure, the codes of physicochemical conditions are included. In addition, these codes can be a representation for various eclectic circumstances, such as presence or absence of light, impact of x-Rays beems, as well seasons (e.g. summer-winter). Analysis of quasi-SMILES of pharmaceuticals by Monte Carlo technique, applied via the CORAL software, shows it is possible to build predictive models using a one-variable correlation between optimal (flexible) descriptors and the removal rates. Removal rates used to build the model were obtained from recent publications including seasonal differences. The statistical characteristics of the best models for removal rates of pharmaceuticals and dyes are quite good for external validation set. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The consumption of antibiotics in today's world has increased tremendously and as such they are frequently found in effluents, sewage treatment plants, hospital waste water and surface water like lakes and rivers. The aquatic organisms are severely affected due to the presence of these antibiotics. Moreover, as these antibiotics are mostly recalcitrant, biological treatment methods are not feasible. Hence, the present study is focused on the treatment of one such antibiotic called norfloxacin using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The parameters considered in this study include the effect of UV, initial pH of the recalcitrant solution, UV/H2O2, Fenton, photo-Fenton process, UV/TiO2 and UV/TiO2 immobilization with glass beads. Among all the processes studied, photo-Fenton process has found to be effective and removed 96% of the norfloxacin. The optimum conditions obtained for the maximum degradation with photo-Fenton process are: pH 3, H2O2 concentration of 200mg/L and iron concentration of 30mg/L, for an initial drug concentration of 150ppm.

AB In this work, we investigated the emerging pollutants in Taiwanese groundwater for the first time and correlated their presence with possible contamination sources. Fifty target pharmaceuticals and perfluorinated chemicals in groundwater were mostly present at ng L-1 concentrations, except for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, sulfamethoxazole, and acetaminophen (maximums of 1822, 1820, and 1036 ng L-1, respectively). Perfluorinated compounds were detected with the highest frequencies in groundwater at almost all of the sample sites, especially short-chained perfluorinated carboxylates, which were easily transferred to the groundwater. The results indicate that the compounds found to have high detection frequencies and concentrations in groundwater are similar to those found in other countries around the world. Most common pharmaceuticals that contain hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonamide antibiotics and caffeine, are easily transported through surface waters to groundwater. The results also indicated that the persistent natures of emerging contaminants with high detection frequencies in surface water and groundwater, such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (risk quotient >1), caffeine, and carbamazepine, should be further studied and evaluated.

AB Iopromide has been frequently detected in different environmental compartments. However, the biodegradation of iopromide was limited, and significantly different removal efficiencies by various methods were reported. In this study, a Pseudomonas sp. I-24 isolated from activated sludge in a sewage treatment plant was used to degrade iopromide. Four different cosubstrates were selected as the cometabolic carbon and energy sources. The results showed that cosubstrate starch was able to increase catabolic enzymatic activity and enhance iopromide degradation. The degradation efficiency of iopromide was as high as 88.24 %, which was much higher as compared with other cosubstrates (38.58-51.44 %) and blank sample (2.81 %). Additionally, the highest enzymatic activity of 0.182 mU for iopromide degradation was also obtained when adding starch as a cosubstrate, somehow supporting that higher enzymatic activity resulted in higher degradation efficiency for iopromide. Although little was illuminated about the molecular mechanism during the degradation process of iopromide with starch addition, the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results indicated that the iopromide-degrading cells growing with cosubstrate starch underwent significant physiological changes.

AB This study investigated the photocatalytic degradation of three beta-blockers in TiO2 suspensions. The disappearance of the compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and the rate constants were 0.075, 0.072 and 0.182 min(-1) for atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol, respectively. After 240 min irradiation, the reaction intermediates were completely mineralized to CO2 and the nitrogen was predominantly as NH4+. The influence of initial pH and beta-blocker concentration on the kinetics was also studied. From adsorption studies it appears that the photocatalytic degradation occurred mainly on the surface of TiO2. Further studies indicated that surface reaction with (OH)-O-center dot radical was principally responsible for the degradation of these three beta-blockers. The major degradation intermediates were identified by HPLC/MS analysis. Cleavage of the side chain and the addition of the hydroxyl group to the parent compounds were found to be the two main degradation pathways for all three beta-blockers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The individual and combined biochemical responses of erythromycin and ketoconazole have been examined in an organism representative of the aquatic environment, crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The possible interactions between erythromycin and ketoconazole were investigated on the bioaccumulation and the expression of biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), and an antioxidant defense enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in fish tissues. After 14 days of combined exposure (erythromycin + ketoconazole), the addition of ketoconazole at nominal concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 20 mu g/L significantly increased the accumulation of erythromycin in fish bile; however, elevated erythromycin accumulation levels were not observed in the other test tissues. The inductions of EROD and SOD activity to erythromycin were inhibited by the combined exposure of ketoconazole in most cases; however, the GST activity returned to normal with exposure time and concentration of combined administration. From the tested pharmaceutical mixtures, it indicated that certain specific combinations may pose some perturbations in biochemical responses in fish and also provide a better understanding of the effects of toxic mixtures.

AB The diverse mixture of contaminants frequently present in estuaries complicates their assessment by routine chemical or biological analyses. We investigated the use of gene expression to assess contaminant exposure and the condition of southern California estuarine fish. Liver gene expression, plasma estradiol concentrations, and gonad histopathology were used to study biological condition in longjaw mudsuckers (Gillichthys mirabilis). Metals, legacy organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, and contaminants of emerging concern were detected in sediments and whole fish. Overall gene expression patterns were characteristic to each of four sites investigated in this study. Differentially expressed genes belonged to several functional categories including xenobiotic metabolism, detoxification, disease, and stress responses. In general, plasma estradiol concentrations were similar among fish from all areas. Some fish gonads had pathologic changes (e.g., infection, inflammation) that could indicate weakened immune systems and chronic stress. The differential expression of some genes involved in stress responses correlated with the prevalence of histologic gonad lesions. This study indicates that gene expression is a promising tool for assessing the biological condition of fish exposed to environmental contaminants.

AB Pharmaceutical residues released into the environment are posing more and more public health problems. It is worthwhile to study the retention of pharmaceuticals residues by adsorption on solid supports. Batch sorption experiments are intended to identify the adsorption isotherms of the pharmaceutically active ingredient on the biomaterials. The results obtained in this study have shown that the retention possibilities of these compounds by bio-adsorbents (clay and sand) are not significant. The negligible sorption for these media is explained by the low hydrophobicity of paracetamol (Log K-ow = 0.46). The retention of paracetamol on the dehydrated sewage sludge and on Posidonia oceanica showed a relatively significant adsorption with a maximal quantity of 0.956 mg g(-1) and 1.638 mg g(-1) for the dehydrate sludge and P. oceanica, respectively. On the other hand, the study of paracetamol retention on the powdered activated carbon showed a high adsorption capacity of about 515.27 mg g(-1). Isotherm data show a good fit with Langmuir's model. An infrared analysis is carried out. It shows identical bands before and after adsorption, with some modifications.

AB A set of bioassays (acute toxicity to Daphnia, genotoxicity, estrogenic and antiestrogenic toxicity) was used to evaluate the safety of reclaimed water reuse in a lab-scale artificial groundwater recharge system. zonation of 1 mg O-3 . (mg DOC)(-1) was used as the pretreatment and was proved to be effective in removing the four toxicity, with removal ratios ranging from 56% to 99%. In the vadose layer, the responsible compounds for toxicity were less efficiently removed than the bulk organic compounds. However, they were preferentially removed during the saturated aquifer treatment, with all the toxic effects per carbon mass dropping by 20-50%. Therefore, more than one month traveling in the aquifer is suggested before water reuse. Since UV254 was significantly correlated with the toxicity data, it could serve as an indicator of the toxicity. With the bioassay-based safety evaluation, the combination of soil aquifer treatment and ozonation could provide new water sources with no higher toxic than the conventional natural drinking water source.

AB Improper disposal of effluents from bulk drug manufacturing units creates a pathway for antibiotics to enter the aquatic environment. This study investigated the presence and distribution of antibiotics belonging to fluoroquinolone group (ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, norflaxacin, enrofloxacin, pefloxacin, and difloxacin) in the aquatic environment of the Musi River in India. Results showed that fluoroquinolones were present in exceptionally high concentrations in the river. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were frequently detected with the highest concentrations, up to 5,015, 542.4, and 251 mu g/L, respectively. Due to the impact of effluents from bulk drug manufacturing units, antibiotic concentration was observed to be several folds higher than the usual range of its occurrence around the world. Positive correlation was observed between the concentration of fluoroquinolones in the water and sediment samples collected along the river due to sorption affinity of fluoroquinolones onto solids. The findings from the present study call for an increased focus on the development of regulatory specification and safe disposal practices of bulk drug manufacturing units into surface water.

AB Inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE) has been widely used as an environmental biomarker of exposure to organophosphates (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides. However, other chemical compounds, considered to be widespread anthropogenic contaminants, can exert toxic effects through the inhibition of this enzyme's activity. The present work intended to assess the acute effects caused by several pharmaceutical drugs (diazepam, clofibrate and clofibric acid) and two detergents (sodium dodecylsulphate, and benzalkonium chloride) on the soluble ChE activity present in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) total head homogenates. These results showed that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was not responsive to the tested compounds, under the testing conditions. SDS and benzalkonium chloride were not responsible for in vivo inhibition of the enzyme's activity, although contrary results have been published for other models and under distinct circumstances. This fact leads to an evaluation of this enzyme's role in modern bio-monitoring schemes for the assessment of anthropogenic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and detergents.

AB Residues of three phenazone-type pharmaceuticals have been identified in routine analyses of groundwater samples from selected areas in the north-western districts of Berlin, Germany. Phenazone, propiphenazone, and dimethyl-aminophenazone have been detected in some wells at concentrations up to the low mug/1-level. Additionally, three phenazone-type metabolites namely 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenyihydrazide (AMDOPH), 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-phenylhydrazide, and dimethyloxalamide acid-(N'-methyl-N-phenyl)-hydrazide have also been identified in these groundwater samples. The residues are suspected to originate from former production spills of a pharmaceutical plant located in a city north of Berlin. It was observed that with the exception of AMDOPH all other residues were efficiently removed during conventional drinking water treatment. The drug metabolite AMDOPH deriving from dimethylaminophenazone residues was found at concentrations of 0.9 mug/1 in finished drinking water. However, a following study on the toxicological relevance of the AMDOPH residues has shown that there is no toxicological harm for humans at the low concentrations of AMDOPH observed in Berlin drinking water.

AB Ten pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were determined in northern Taiwan estuarine waters and Taiwan Strait (TS) seawater. The ecological risk of these PhACs was assessed using risk quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of the measured maximum concentration to the predicted no-effect concentration. Six PhACs were detected within the estuarine waters. Caffeine concentration (130-718 ngl(-1)) was the highest among the analyzed PhACs. The distribution of PhACs in the Danshuei River Estuary generally exhibited addition behavior, except that caffeine showed conservative behavior. Carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, caffeine, and ketoprofen were detected in TS seawaters. Their concentrations follow the sequence: gemfibrozil > ketoprofen > caffeine > carbamazepine. The caffeine concentrations in TS seawaters were 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those in Danshuei estuarine waters. With few exceptions for caffeine, erythromycin, and sulfadiazine posing low risk in some estuarine waters, most of the RQ values were < 0.01, suggesting no adverse effects on aquatic organisms.

AB Occurrences of pharmaceuticals are evident in aquatic organisms. A reproducible gas chromatography-. mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method using selected ion monitoring (SIM) has been used to determine the anti-histamine diphenhydramine (DPH), anti-anxiety diazepam (DZP), anti-seizure carbamazepine (CZP) drugs and their metabolites in grocery stores fish that were homogenized, extracted, pre-concentrated, cleaned up, and examined. Identifications of the compounds in extracts were obtained by comparing similar mass spectral features and retention properties with standards. Among nine frequently detected drugs, only DPH and DZP were observed and ranged from 0.61 to 6.21 and 1.99 to 16.57 ng/g, respectively, in fourteen fish species. These concentration values were lower than the environmental fish. Mean spike recoveries of analytes exceeded 75% with relative standard deviations (RSD) < 10%. The statistically-derived method detection limits (MDLs) for nine compounds ranged from 0.13 to 5.56 ng/g. Average surrogate recoveries were 80-85% with 4-9% RSD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The natural range of fish species in our rivers is related to flow, elevation, temperature, local habitat and connectivity. For over 2000 years, humans have altered to varying degrees the river habitat. In the past 200 years, we added to the environmental disruption by discharging poorly treated sewage, nutrients and industrial waste into our rivers. For many rivers, the low point arrived during the period of 1950s-1970s, when rapid economic development overrode environmental concerns and dissolved oxygen concentrations dropped to zero. In these more enlightened times, gross river pollution is a thing of the past in the Developed World. However, persistent legacy chemical contaminants can be found in fish long after their discharge ceased. Changes in habitat quality and morphology caused and continue to cause the disappearance of fish species. The range of fish stressors has now increased as temperatures rise, and non-native fish introductions bring new diseases. The threat from pharmaceuticals to fish populations remains hypothetical, and no studies have yet linked change in fish populations to exposure.

TI Evaluation of Contaminant Removal of Reverse Osmosis and Advanced

AB Advanced water treatment of secondary treated effluent requires stringent quality control to achieve a water quality suitable for augmenting drinking water supplies. The removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, industrial chemicals, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCP) is paramount. As the concentrations of individual contaminants are typically low, frequent analytical screening is both laborious and costly. We propose and validate an approach for continuous monitoring by applying passive sampling with Empore disks in vessels that were designed to slow down the water flow, and thus uptake kinetics, and ensure that the uptake is only marginally dependent on the chemicals' physicochemical properties over a relatively narrow molecular size range. This design not only assured integrative sampling over 27 days for a broad range of chemicals but also permitted the use of a suite of bioanalytical tools as sum parameters, representative of mixtures of chemicals with a common mode of toxic action. Bioassays proved to be more sensitive than chemical analysis to assess the removal of organic micropollutants by reverse osmosis, followed by UV/H(2)O(2) treatment, as many individual compounds fell below the quantification limit of chemical analysis, yet still contributed to the observed mixture toxicity. Nonetheless in several cases, the responses in the bioassays were also below their quantification limits and therefore only three bioassays were evaluated here, representing nonspecific toxicity and two specific end points for estrogenicity and photosynthesis inhibition. Chemical analytical techniques were able to quantify 32 pesticides, 62 PCPPs, and 12 EDCs in reverse osmosis concentrate. However, these chemicals could explain only 1% of the nonspecific toxicity in the Microtox assay in the reverse osmosis concentrate and 0.0025% in the treated water. Likewise only 1% of the estrogenic effect in the E-SCREEN could be explained by the quantified EDCs after reverse osmosis. In comparison, >50% of the estrogenic effect can typically be explained in sewage. Herbicidal activity could be fully explained by chemical analysis as the sampling period coincided with an illegal discharge and two herbicides dominated the mixture effect. The mass balance of the reverse osmosis process matched theoretical expectations for both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. Overall the investigated treatment train removed >97% estrogenicity, >99% herbicidal activity, and >96% baseline toxicity, confirming the suitability of the treatment train for polishing water for indirect potable reuse. The product water was indistinguishable from local tap water in all three bioassays. This study demonstrates the suitability and robustness of passive sampling linked with bioanalytical tools for semicontinuous monitoring of advanced water treatment with respect to micropollutant removal.

AB The treatment of enrofloxacin synthetic wastewaters using conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO), ozonation. and Fenton oxidation has been studied. Results show that the three technologies can reduce the organic content of enrofloxacin synthetic wastewaters but with different performances. CDEO was the most efficient technology in terms of mineralization but not on COD removal, which was more efficiently achieved by ozonation. This indicates that ozonation is efficient in the breakage of the complex molecules but not on the removal of final carboxylic acids. The high initial efficiency in terms of oxidant-use obtained by Fenton oxidation evidences that it is very efficient in the removal of the enrofloxacin, although it rapidly leads to the formation of refractory compounds to the treatment. This indicates the significance of other oxidation mechanisms (e.g. coagulation) that enhance the results obtained by the expected hydroxyl-mediated oxidation. Ammonium ions were the primary product species in CDEO and nitrate ions in ozonation, whereas Fenton effluents contained similar amounts of both nitrogen ionic species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Antibiotics may appear in the environment when manure, sewage sludge, and other organic amendments are added to soils. There is concern that the presence of antibiotics in soils may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which may spread to the rest of the environment. This paper aims at evaluating the sorption kinetics of two antibiotics frequently used in pig production. The results indicate that sorption of chlortetracycline (CTC) and tylosin (TYL) in sandy loam and clay occurs very fast. More than 95% of the CTC adsorption is completed within 10 min on both soils and of TYL within 3 h. These results suggest that 24-h soil and antibiotic solution mixtures is enough for sorption studies. Also, there is less likelihood that these antibiotics will leach through soil and appear in the ground water since their sorption on soils is very high unless they are carried by soil particles through preferential flow. There was also no effect of soil sterilization on sorption kinetics of these antibiotics thus suggesting that there is minimal probability of the antibiotics degrading by microorganisms during 24- to 48-h adsorption studies.

AB In this study the degradation of an aqueous solution of clofibric acid was investigated during catalytic ozonation and Fenton-like process with FeOOH - derived catalysts. From the different calcination temperatures tested, it has been observed that the most active catalyst is the commercial FeOOH calcined at 200 degrees C, when maghemite and hematite are the predominant phases obtained. The best result, at room temperature, for CFA mineralization was observed over 0.5 wt% Pd on FeOOH (calcined at 200 degrees C) among all tested catalysts, achieving 68% and 81% mineralization degree, in 2 h and 6 h, respectively, in catalytic ozonation and 66% and 71% of mineralization degree within 2 h and 6 h, respectively for Fenton process. The efficiency of the Fenton-like process is enhanced at higher temperature (40-60 degrees C), reaching a mineralization degree up to 82% in 6 h. Furthermore, Pd impregnation on FeOOH increased the catalyst stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although trace concentrations of ibuprofen (IBP) have been detected in diverse water bodies, there is currently insufficient information on the potentially deleterious effects of this xenobiotic. The present study aimed to determine whether IBP induces oxidative stress in brain, liver, gill, and blood of the common carp Cyprinus carpio. To this end, the median lethal concentration at 96 h (96-h LC50) was determined and the lowest observed adverse effect level was established. Carp were exposed to the latter concentration (17.6 mg L-1) for 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and the following biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation (LPX) and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Results indicated that LPX and antioxidant enzymes' activity increased significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to the control group in liver, gill, and blood, while no significant differences occurred in brain. In conclusion, IBP induced oxidative stress on C. carpio, the liver being the organ most affected by this damage.

AB Reduction of bulk organic matter, nitrogen, and pharmaceutically active compounds from primary effluent during managed aquifer recharge was investigated using laboratory-scale batch reactors. Biologically stable batch reactors were spiked with different concentrations of sodium azide to inhibit biological activity and probe the effect of microbial activity on attenuation of various pollutants of concern. The experimental results obtained revealed that removal of dissolved organic carbon correlated with active microbial biomass. Furthermore, addition of 2 mM of sodium azide affected nitrite-oxidizing bacteria leading to accumulation of nitrite-nitrogen in the reactors while an ammonium-nitrogen reduction of 95.5 % was achieved. Removal efficiencies of the hydrophilic neutral compounds phenacetin, paracetamol, and caffeine were independent of the extent of the active microbial biomass and were >90% in all reactors, whereas removal of pentoxifylline was dependent on the biological stability of the reactor. However, hydrophobic ionic compounds exhibited removal efficiency >80 % in batch reactors with the highest biological activity as evidenced by high concentration of adenosine triphosphate.

AB Biological nutrient removal and the fate of two estrogenic compounds, bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,4-dicholorophenol (2,4-DCP) were studied using a sequencing anoxic/anaerobic-aerobic membrane bioreactor (SAM) which was fed with synthetic water and operated at SRT of 60 days. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), COD, BPA and 2,4-DCP removal performances were evaluated. The SAM showed efficient COD removal (>99%) throughout the period of operation. The TN and TP removal efficiencies were 74.3 +/- 4.7% and 79.1 +/- 7.2%, respectively. The removal efficiency of BPA and 2,4-DCP was 74.3% and 78% on average basis respectively. A mass balance of both compounds was derived considering the hydraulic characteristics of the system, mass flux due to air stripping and quantity of adsorbed compound discharged with daily excess sludge wastage. The results indicated that biodegradation was the major removal path way from the system contributing above 80% of removal.

TI Defining the chronic impacts of atenolol on embryo-larval development

AB Atenolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist ('beta-blocker') widely used for the treatment of angina, glaucoma related conditions. Since atenolol is not appreciably metabolized in humans, the parent compound is the predominant excretory product, and has been detected in sewage effluent discharges and surface waters. Consequently, atenolol has been chosen as a reference pharmaceutical for a European Union-funded research consortium, known as ERAPharm (http://www.erapharm.org), which focused on the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Here, we present data generated within this project from studies assessing population-relevant effects in a freshwater fish species. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as a standard OECD test species, embryo-larval development (early life stage or ELS) and short-term (21 d) adult reproduction studies were undertaken. In the ELS study, the 4 d embryo NOEChatching and LOEChatching values were 10 and > 10 mg/L, respectively, and after 28 d, NOECgrowth and LOECgrowth values were 3.2 and 10 mg/L, respectively (arithmetic mean measured atenolol concentrations were >90% of these nominal values). In the short-term reproduction study, NOECreproduction and LOECreproduction values were 10 and >10 mg/L, respectively (mean measured concentrations were 77-96% of nominal values), while the most sensitive endpoint was an increase in male fish condition index, giving NOECcondition index and LOECcondition index values of 1.0 and 3.2 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding measured plasma concentration of atenolol in these fish was 0.0518 mg/L. These data collectively suggest that atenolol has low chronic toxicity to fish under the conditions described, particularly considering the low environmental concentrations reported. These data also allowed the assessment of two theoretical approaches proposed as predictors of the environmental impact of human pharmaceuticals: the Huggett 'mammalian-fish leverage model'; and the acute:chronic ratio (ACR). The Huggett model gave a measured human: fish effect ratio (ER) of 19.3 for atenolol, which compared well with the predicted ER of 40.98. Moreover, for an ER of 19.3, the model suggests that chronic testing may be warranted, and from our resultant effects data, atenolol does not cause significant chronic effects in fathead minnow at environmentally realistic concentrations. The calculated ACR for atenolol is >31.25, which is far lower than that of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and other potent steroidal oestrogens, thus further supporting the observed low toxicity. The data produced for atenolol here fit well with both approaches, but also highlight the importance of generating 'real' experimental data with which to calibrate and validate such models.

AB The present study provides robust consensus quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models developed from 334 organic chemicals covering a wide chemical domain for the prediction of effective concentrations of chemicals for 50% and 10% inhibition of algal growth. Only 2D descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning were employed for QSAR model building, whereas development, validation and interpretation were achieved following the strict Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommended guidelines. Genetic algorithm along with stepwise approach was used in feature selection while the final QSAR models were derived using partial least squares regression technique. The applicability domain of the developed models was also checked. The obtained consensus models were then used to predict 64 organic chemicals having no definite observed responses while the confidence of predictions was checked by the 'prediction reliability indicator' tool. The developed models should be applicable for data gap filling in case of new or untested organic chemicals provided they fall within the domain of the model and can also be implemented to design safer alternatives to the environment.

AB Among soil organisms, nematodes are seen as the most promising candidates for bioindications of soil health. We hypothesized that the soil nematode community structure would differ in three land use areas (agricultural, forest and industrial soils), be modulated by soil parameters (N, P, K, pH, SOM, CaCO3, granulometric fraction, etc.), and strongly affected by high levels of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Hg) and emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products, PPCPs). Although these pollutants did not significantly affect the total number of free-living nematodes, diversity and structure community indices vastly altered. Our data showed that whereas nematodes with r-strategy were tolerant, genera with k-strategy were negatively affected by the selected pollutants. These effects diminished in soils with high levels of heavy metals given their adaptation to the historical pollution in this area, but not to emerging pollutants like PPCPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesised, characterised, and used as a peroxidase mimetic to accelerate levofloxacin sono-degradation in an ultrasound (US)/H2O2 system. The Fe3O4 MNPs were in nanometre scale with an average diameter of approximately 12 to 18 nm. The introduction of Fe3O4 MNPs increased levofloxacin sono-degradation in the US/H2O2 system. Experimental parameters, such as Fe3O4 MNP dose, initial solution pH, and H2O2 concentration, were investigated by a one-factor-at-a-time approach. The results showed that Fe3O4 MNPs enhanced levofloxacin removal in the pH range from 4.0 to 9.0. Levofloxacin removal ratio increased with Fe3O4 MNP dose up to 1.0 g.L-1 and with H2O2 concentration until reaching the maximum. Moreover, three main intermediate compounds were identified by HPLC with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry, and a possible degradation pathway was proposed. This study suggests that combination of H2O2, Fe3O4 MNPs and US is a good way to improve the degradation efficiency of antibiotics.

AB The efforts were made in this study to decompose the herbal pharmaceutical industrial waste (HPIW) using earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny) under laboratory conditions. To achieve the objectives HPIW was mixed with cow dung (CD) in different ratios to produce five different waste mixtures for vermicomposting: T-1 - CD (100%), T-2 - HPIW (25%) + CD (75%), T-3 - HPIW (50%) + CD (50%), T-4 - HPIW (75%) + CD (25%) and T-5 - HPIW (100%). Vermicomposting caused significant changes in vermibed characteristics. In all waste mixtures, a decrease in pH, organic C, C:P ratio and C:N ratio, but increase total N, available P and exchangeable K was recorded. C:N ratio of end material (vermicompost) was within the agronomic preferable limit (> 15). T-3 and T-4 vermibeds showed better mineralization and waste decomposition rate during vermicomposting. E. fetida produced cocoons in the ranges of 81.0 +/- 9.54 (T-1)-306.33 +/- 14.31(T-4) in all vermibeds. Results clearly suggested that vermicomposting could be an efficient technology to convert HPIW into some value-added products for ecological restoration practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB As part of a regional screening to evaluate the risk, for the health of populations, to certain classes of emerging substances, several families of pharmaceuticals and hormones were looked for in waters intended to drinking. Thus, 52 substances were investigated in 71 surface waters and 70 groundwaters. Results indicate that no water was free of pollutants, regardless of its origin (surface or groundwater) and the season of collect. The pharmaceuticals most frequently detected and with the highest concentration levels were salicylic acid, carbamazepine and acetaminophen. Among hormones, testosterone, androstenedione and progesterone were detected in almost all the samples. Globally the groundwaters were less contaminated than surface waters in regards pharmaceuticals frequencies and levels. On the other side, androgens and progestagens were present with comparable frequencies and levels in both compartments. The risk linked to the presence of these substances on human health is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant growth and productivity under abiotic stresses such as water shortage or pollution are major problems which currently worry scientists in the field of food production and plant health. Since the intensification of livestock production with its associated increased demand for fodder has encouraged farmers to rely more heavily on chemical fertilizers, very often, municipal waste and wastewater sludge is considered a possible source of plant nutrients, although it might carry a significant amount of anthropogeneous pollutants. The extent to which plants react to drought, as well as how pollutants are taken up or how they act on plants, might depend on rhizosphere processes such as mycorrhizal symbioses. Therefore, it seemed timely to investigate plant defense reactions in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) toward a possible dangerous sewage sludge pollutant under the influence of drought.
   This study was done with mycorrhizal plants (+AMF) and non-mycorrhizal plants (-AMF) under conditions of water shortage and certain supplements of pharmaceutics. Plant water relations, activity of plant detoxification enzymes, and phylogeny of root mycorrhization were surveyed to investigate beneficial aspects of AMF symbiosis. Plants were exposed to certain drought phases and watered with tap water containing the pharmaceutical paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a model xenobiotic with environmental relevance. Enzymes of interest for the present study were catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Assays followed published methods. GST spectrophotometric assays included model substrates 1-chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzoyl-chloride.
   Our observations indicate H2O2 accumulation in roots of AMF plants and concomitant increases of catalase activities. Enzyme activities were lower in AMF plants even after exposure to both drought stress and paracetamol. AMF symbiosis seems a strategy to influence plant water tolerance and stress enzymes. Catalase activity seemed to be exhausted at the end of 56 days of drought treatment and pharmaceutics incubation, as indicated by high H2O2 levels at the end of the experiment. GST reactions differed between drought or paracetamol-stressed plants. A combination of both stressors resulted in lowered GST activities. Both catalase and GST activities decreased in the presence of paracetamol in the AMF roots after drought treatment. When soil water contents declined, AMF symbiosis supported leaf water content and production of biomass. During dry cycles, AMF roots achieved lower activities of cytosolic GST than that as compared to non-mycorrhizal roots. However, under drought and pharmaceutics supplements, water relations of mycorrhizal plants were more balanced than in non-mycorrhizal plants. In addition, roots showed an enhanced mycorrhization rate in those circumstances.
   We propose that the adjustment of CAT and GST activities in mycorrhizal roots under drought and xenobiotics might be caused by a decreased oxidative damage to rhizosphere because AMF plants had consistently better plant water relations and biomass production. Additional drought avoidance mechanisms indicated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis might also contribute to the lower oxidative stress in mycorrhizal plants. Since the role of mycorrhiza in the fate of organic pollutants has not yet been understood, further ecotoxicological studies in mycorrhizosphere needs to be achieved as cooperation between plant-microbe specialists and ecotoxicologists.

AB Application of photo-Fenton for wastewater reuse is a hot-topic research activity for defining alternative water sources. In sunny water-stressed countries, solar irradiation is under study as a sustainable pollution-free energy source for powering photo-Fenton water treatment. In solar photo-Fenton, water containing iron and H2O2 is irradiated to promote generation of hydroxyl radicals, which can degrade pharmaceuticals and other pollutants of emerging concern. As homogeneous photoFenton has several disadvantages, such as its narrow pH operating range compared with other well-studied AOPs, photo-Fenton-like processes working at circumneutral pH have been widely investigated. Heterogeneous photo-Fenton is considered effective because of its wide working pH range and cyclability. Nevertheless, design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts remains the major challenge. This article discusses key photo-Fenton parameters as well as its limitations and future perspectives for real implementation.

This study investigates the combined effects of tetracycline antibiotics on the performance of an algal photo-bioreactor operated under different antibiotic concentrations in the ranges of 0.25 to 30 mg/L and considers the inhibition of algal growth, carbon and nutrient removal rates, and eukaryotic and cyanobacterial algal community changes. The results indicated that increases in the concentration of tetracycline mixtures have adverse effects on the algal community and the performance of a photo-bioreactor, and the eukaryotic algae species were more sensitive to tetracycline antibiotics than were the cyanobacterial species. Cultivation tests showed that approximately 94 % growth inhibition of mixed algae occurred at 30 mg/L.

AB Antiviral drugs have been recently recognized as one of the emerging contaminants in the environment. These are discharged after therapeutic use through human excretion. Effluent containing high concentration of antiviral drugs discharged from production facilities is also a cause of concern to nearby aquatic bodies. There is an increased interest in their removal because they are highly bioactive. Some antiviral drugs are resistant to conventional methods of degradation, and there is a risk of development of antiviral resistance in humans and animals if exposed repeatedly for long periods. To date, the potential human, animal, and ecological risks associated with the discharge of these antiviral compounds to the environment are not well documented. This study presents a brief summary on occurrence, ecotoxicological risks, and physicochemical properties of antiviral drugs in the environment. The needs regarding removal, disposal, and treatment of antiviral drugs are also addressed.

AB The pharmaceutical industrial effluents, which include several organic solvents and other toxic chemicals, are generally treated by aerobic process, which is cost intensive in nature. The alternative anaerobic route to degrade the toxic effluents is attractive due to the lower cost of treatment and the generation of gas, which can supplement the energy requirements. There are few reports on the anaerobic treatment of the pharmaceutical effluents. In the present investigation, the effluents from a bulk drug industry, which utilizes several organic chemicals, have been taken to assess their applicability for anaerobic treatment. The organic loading rates were varied from 0.25 kg/m(3)/day to 2.5 kg/m(3)/day and the COD reduction was found to be in the range of 60 to 80%. Long term operation of an anaerobic suspended film contact reactor carried out with 1.25 kg/m(3)/day was found to be optimum. The biogas generated during the degradation process was monitored and the methane content was found to be 60-70%.

AB Two types of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (pharmaceutical POCIS and pesticide POCIS) were examined for their sampling efficiency of selected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCS). Laboratory-based calibration of POCISs was conducted by exposing them at high and low concentrations of 14 EDCs (4-alkyl-phenols, their ethoxylate oligomers, bisphenol A, selected estrogens and synthetic steroids) for different time periods. The kinetic studies showed an integrative uptake up to 28 days. The sampling rates for the individual compounds were obtained. The use of POCISs could result in an integrative approach to the quality status of the aquatic systems especially in the case of high variation of water concentrations of EDCs. The sampling efficiency of POCISs under various field conditions was assessed after their deployment in different aquatic environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This chapter evaluates the economic and environmental implications of MBR using Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A brief introduction to these methodologies and the main developments and achievements when applied to MBR is given before the presentation of two case studies. In the first case study, CBA and LCA were applied for the assessment of seven wastewater treatment plants using MBR and other membrane technologies. The results highlighted the benefits of removal of substances responsible for eutrophication and the relevance of the scale factor regarding electricity use, one of the main environmental and economic costs. In the second case study, LCA alone was applied for the environmental assessment of four novel MBR configurations at pilot-plant scale focusing on the removal of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), of which only hormones were found to be relevant in terms of toxicity due to their higher concentrations in the influent.

AB This research investigated removal, mineralization, and bioincorporation of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in membrane bioreactors and conventional bioreactors. When the influent EE2 concentration was >50 mu g/L, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) biomass removed more EE2 than conventional bioreactor (CBR) biomass in continuous tests, likely because the sorption partitioning coefficients are higher for MBR biomass. Microautoradiography was carried out to investigate the distribution of EE2 within the aggregates retrieved from the bioreactors, and the results revealed concentration gradients present within the floc. Experiments using radiolabeled C-14-EE2 experiments (done with 24.5 mu g/L EE2) showed that EE2 removal rates and the amount of EE2 mineralized were similar in MBRs and CBRs. Direct measurements and bioenergetic estimates suggest that EE2-related carbon is probably incorporated into active biomass, despite the fact that EE2 was added at a concentration that was much lower than that of the primary growth substrates.

AB This study demonstrates continuous enantiomeric inversion and further biotransformation of chiral profens including ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen by an enzymatic membrane bioreactor (EMBR) dosed with laccase. The EMBR showed non-enantioselective transformations, with high and consistent transformation of both (R)-and (S)-ibuprofen (93 +/- 6%, n = 10), but lower removals of both enantiomers of naproxen (46 +/- 16%, n = 10) and ketoprofen (48 +/- 17%, n = 10). Enantiomeric analysis revealed a bidirectional but uneven inversion of the profens, for example 14% inversion of (R)- to (S)- compared to 4% from (S)-to (R)-naproxen. With redox-mediator addition, the enzymatic chiral inversion of both (R)-and (S)-profens remained unchanged, although the overall conversion became enantioselective; except for (S)-naproxen, the addition of redox mediator promoted the degradation of (R)-profens only.

AB Emerging micropollutants have been recently the target of interest for their potential harmful effects in the environment and their resistance to conventional water treatments. Catalytic ozonation is an advanced oxidation process consisting of the formation of highly reactive radicals from the decomposition of ozone promoted by a catalyst. Nanocarbon materials have been shown to be effective catalysts for this process, either in powder form or grown on the surface of a monolithic structure. In this work, carbon nanofibers grown on the surface of a cordierite honeycomb monolith are tested as catalyst for the ozonation of five selected micropollutants: atrazine (ATZ), bezafibrate, erythromycin, metolachlor, and nonylphenol. The process is tested both in laboratorial and real conditions. Later on, ATZ was selected as a target pollutant to further investigate the role of the catalytic material. It is shown that the inclusion of a catalyst improves the mineralization degree compared to single ozonation.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining acceptance for modern control systems in various applications in daily life including the Chemical process industry. Above all, application of AI is increasing in the field of membrane-based treatment where it shows great potential until now. Membrane separations are generally recognized as energy-efficient processes. In particular, membrane desalination, forward osmosis, energy generation, and biomass treatment have shown substantial potential in modern industries, such as wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and natural products. All these industries consume more than 20% of total energy consumption in the world. Moreover, the laboratory research outcomes illuminate the way to better membrane design and development, including advanced process control and optimization. The membrane processes with existing technologies for a sustainable environment could be integrated with the AI model. This review summarizes several membrane-based water treatment designs and plant performances where artificial intelligence is being used to minimize waste generation and lead to cleaner production.

AB Today, it is considered state-of-the-art to engineer living organisms for various biotechnology applications. Even though this has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs, the enclosed interior of bacterial cells still restricts interactions with enzymes, pathways and products due to the mass-transfer barrier formed by the cell envelope. To promote accessibility, we propose engineering of biocatalytic reactions and subsequent product deposition directly on the bacterial surface. As a proof-of-concept, we used the AIDA autotransporter vehicle for Escherichia coli surface expression of tyrosinase and fully oxidized externally added tyrosine to the biopolymer melanin. This resulted in a color change and creation of a black cell exterior. The capture of ninety percent of a pharmaceutical wastewater pollutant followed by regeneration of the cell bound melanin matrix through a simple pH change, shows the superior function and facilitated processing provided by the surface methodology. The broad adsorption spectrum of melanin could also allow removal of other micropollutants.

AB The electrochemical oxidation (EO) treatment in water of Fantetra, a veterinary drug widely used in Chile, and its components: oxytetracycline hydrochloride, phtalylsulfathiazole and diphenhydramine, has been carried out at constant current using a BDD/Stainless steel system. First, solutions of each drug were electrolyzed following the decay of the absorbance of each compound and total organic carbon abatement. The mineralization of the Fantetra commercial formulation was also studied. An analysis of the degradation by-products was made by high performance liquid chromatography. Thus, during the degradation of each pharmaceutical by the electrochemical oxidation process, aliphatic carboxylic acids were detected prior to their complete mineralization to CO2 and nitrogen ions, while NO3- and NH4+ remain in the treated solution.
   This is an essential preliminary step towards the applicability of the EO processes for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Toxic organic compounds, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, explosives, chlorine disinfection byproducts, petroleum hydrocarbons, and chlorinated solvents have found their way to wetlands from diverse sources, including agricultural and urban runoff, domestic wastewater effluent, and industrial discharges. Evaluations of the fate and ecological effects of these compounds in wetlands depends on accurate and precise methods to determine the concentrations in each of the wetland compartments, including surface water, pore water, soils, and sediments. This can be particularly challenging due to water saturation, low redox conditions, accumulation of organic matter, and reduced S compounds in wetlands, which can complicate and interfere with many of the analytical steps. The goal of this chapter is to summarize and briefly describe the methods that have been used to collect, preserve, extract, analyze, and calculate the concentrations of a multitude of volatile organic compounds and semivolatile organic compounds in the surface water, pore water, and soils and sediments of wetlands.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is the most prescribed antibiotic worldwide and is considered an emerging contaminant. The adsorption of ciprofloxacin onto calcined Verde-lodo (CVL) bentonite clay in a static system was evaluated in this study. CVL clay was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Zeta analyzer before and after application to examine the adsorption mechanism. Statistical techniques of experimental design were used to determine the best conditions to maximize the adsorption capacity of CIP. Static system tests were performed to evaluate the kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamics of adsorption. The system reached a maximum Langmuir removal capacity (25 degrees C) of 114.4 mg g(-1) and CVL clay displayed considerable reuse capacity with heat treatment at 500 degrees C. The ability for regeneration and high removal capacity of CVL provides a promising strategy to mitigate emerging contaminants present in wastewater.

AB Despite the amount of treated wastewater discharged into the Southern California Bight, few studies have examined pharmaceutical compounds in local biota. The Round Stingray (Urobatis hailer was selected as a representative elasmobranch species to perform an exploratory study on environmental pharmaceutical exposure. Archived liver samples of males and females from juvenile to adult size classes from several locations (n = 53) were examined for 18 pharmaceutical and illicit drug compounds using isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS. Very few compounds were detected in stingray livers, with diphenhydramine as the only pharmaceutical above quantitation limits. Only stingrays collected from the urban site (mainland California) had detectable levels of diphenhydramine compared to no detections in reference stingrays (offshore island). Sex and sampling location substantially influenced both detection rate and concentrations. Our results suggest that aspects of species' ecology and physiology should be considered for future studies investigating pharmaceutical exposure in elasmobranchs.

AB This study aims to investigate degradation mechanisms and kinetics of phenoxyacetic acid by ozonation in aqueous solution. The optimized operating condition was achieved by phenoxyacetic acid and total organic carbon (TOC) removal based on the studies of the effects of various parameters, such as pH value (4-12), the initial concentration of phenoxyacetic acid (100-2000 mg L-1) and the ozone dosage (16-48 mg min(-1)). A series of intermediates were formed in the ozonation process and detected by GC/MS and HPLC analysis, such as phenyl formate, salicylic acid, phenol, oxalic acid and small molecule acids. A possible degradation pathway of phenoxyacetic acid was proposed. The kinetic analysis showed that phenoxyacetic acid degradation was in slow kinetic regime based on the results of Ha. This paper can provide basic data and theoretical reference for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by ozonation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diosgenin (CAS No.: 512-04-9) hydrolyzed from Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright is a very important steroid in the pharmaceutical industry. However, serious environmental pollution and poor efficiency in the utilization of this natural resource have yet to be conquered. The aim of this study was to establish a more ecological and efficient approach for producing diosgenin from fresh D. zingiberensis tubers via pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch. The reaction was carried out in a high pressure kettle, and seven parameters, including the sample to acidic solution ratio, concentration of H2SO4 aqueous solution, volume of extraction solvent, reaction temperature, duration of hydrolysis, agitation speed and boiling point of petroleum ether, were sequentially optimized through single factor experimental design. It was shown that the yield of diosgenin has been increased to 4.17% under the optimal conditions, namely, a 1:100 ratio of saponini/acidic solution (g/mL), 50 mL of 2 mu L/mL H2SO4 aqueous solution, 30 mL of petroleum ether (90-120 degrees C), 130 degrees C, 2.0 h and 100 r/min. Then, the newly proposed approach was compared with our previous strategy as well as a conventional method in terms of the yield of diosgenin, the consumption of sulfuric acid and chemical oxygen demand as well as total organic carbon of wastewater. Consequently, it was found that the yield was 22.29% higher than the conventional process, and H2SO4 consumption was reduced by 88.53%. Furthermore, the level of pollution in wastewater of the novel strategy has fallen greatly as the chemical oxygen demand and the total organic carbon were decreased by 50.15% and 64.39%. Comprehensively, it has been well demonstrated that the novel strategy based on pressurized biphase acid hydrolysis after recycling the cellulose and starch is a more ecological and effective approach for producing diosgenin from the tubers of fresh D. zingiberensis, and it is a promising strategy for application in industrial practice.

AB The stability of a variety of microporous coordination polymers (MCPs) to water-containing solutions was studied using powder X-ray diffraction. It was determined that the stability of the MCP is related to the metal cluster present in the structure with trinuclear chromium clusters more stable than copper paddlewheel clusters which are more stable than basic zinc acetate clusters. Zn(2-methylimidizolate)(2) was found to be more water stable than zinc MCPs with carboxylate linkers; however, extended exposure to water led to decomposition of all zinc-based MCPs. Materiaux de I'Instiut Lavoisier (MIL)-100 was also found to be completely water stable and was used to adsorb the pharmaceuticals furosemide and sulfasalazine from water with large uptakes achievable at low concentrations. indicating that the adsorption of wastewater contaminants may be a feasible application for these materials.

AB Aquatic systems, particularly in rural areas, may be contaminated by antimicrobials from wastewater treatment effluent or diffuse pollution. Recent investigations of pharmaceutical contaminants in surface waters in the United States and Europe revealed the presence of antimicrobials such as synthetic and naturally derived antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. The fate of these antimicrobials in the aquatic environment, along with the rising trend of antibacterial resistance in aquatic and soil microorganisms, is poorly understood. This research was designed to investigate the removal of antimicrobials in multistage filtration, provide information for rural communities affected by antimicrobial surface water pollution, identify topics for future research, and aid environmental and human health risk assessments. The study examined schmutzdecke sorption behavior and removal efficiencies in a pilot roughing and slow sand filter fed 0.2 mg/L of five compounds from four classes of antimicrobials. Aqueous antimicrobial concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
