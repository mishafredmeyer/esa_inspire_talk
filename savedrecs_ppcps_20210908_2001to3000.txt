AB A rapid quantitative method for 135 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in untreated wastewater enabled with direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is presented. All compounds were analysed within 5 min on a short biphenyl cartridge using only 10 mu L of filtered sample per injection. Up to 76 compounds were monitored simultaneously during the gradient (including mostly two transitions per compound and stable isotope-labelled analogues) while yielding > 10 data points per peak. Evaluation of seven solid phase extraction sorbents showed no advantage for wastewater matrix removal. Excellent linearity, range, accuracy and precision was achieved for most compounds. Matrix effects were < 11 % and detection limits were < 30 ng L-1 on average. Application to untreated wastewater samples from three wastewater treatment works in the UK, USA and Mexico, enabled quantification of 56 compounds. Banned and EU 'watch-list' substances are critically discussed, including pesticides, macrolide antibiotics, diclofenac, illicit drugs as well as multiple pharmaceuticals and biocides. This high-throughput method sets a new standard for the speedy and confident determination of over a hundred CECs in wastewater at the part-per-trillion level, as demonstrated by performing over 260 injections per day.

AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was treated using a microwave-assisted Fenton-like (MW-Fenton-like) process with satisfactory efficiency. Firstly, based on the MW power chosen, three factors, namely ferric sulfate dose, hydrogen peroxide dose, and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration were used to investigate the improvement in the efficiency of the MW-Fenton-like process for pharmaceutical wastewater pretreatment. Ferric sulfate and hydrogen peroxide doses (ferric sulfate 1.5mg/L and hydrogen peroxide 10mL/L) were low, after mixing well, oxidation decomposition was explored without acidification, this time was short (6min). Under optimal conditions, the removal rate of TOC was with satisfactory effects (57.5%). Furthermore, the initial pH value was selected without adjustment when the MW radiation started. It was unnecessary to extend the radiation time because no hydrogen peroxide existed in system with the radiation time of 8min. The influent was unnecessary to be diluted. Biodegradation of the wastewater could be elevated well (BOD5/COD arose from 0.23 to 0.40). Moreover, all of coloration from Riboflavin sodium phosphate dissolved (<15mg/1L wastewater) was completely removed in the sample. Finally, according to the TOC removal, the second step (flocculation precipitation) was as equally important as the first step (oxidation decomposition), though ferric sulfate dose was low. The effect of biological treatment was unsatisfactory compared with MW-Fenton-like process.

AB Very little information on the occurrence and fate of multiple classes of antimicrobials in the aquatic environment is reported for the Southeast Asian region. This study provides the first and comprehensive data on the occurrence of ten different classes of antimicrobials in wastewater samples for Singapore. Among the investigated antimicrobials, 19 out of 21 target compounds were detected in 100% of the collected raw influent samples. Concentrations of the detected antimicrobials in raw influent varied from 23.8 to 43,740 ng/L. Removal of antimicrobials by conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems at a local wastewater treatment plant was evaluated. MBR exhibited better performance over CAS for most target antimicrobials. Beta-lactam, glycopeptide, and fluoroquinolone classes were largely eliminated by biological wastewater treatment processes, whereas trimethoprim and lincosamides appeared to be persistent. Effects of physicochemical properties and chemical structures of target antimicrobials on their removal efficiencies/mechanisms during wastewater treatment process were also discussed.

AB The occurrence of various micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products, endocrine disrupting chemicals (PPCPs/EDCs) and metals in municipal wastewater, and their poor removal efficiencies can lead to toxicity impact on humans, and freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Life cycle assessment is an efficient and effective tool to evaluate the environmental impact of wastewater treatment plants, but guidelines for toxicity assessment are lacking due to the complexity. This study aims to evaluate both life cycle inventory by including metals and PEC, and life cycle toxicity assessment (LCIA) methods namely CML-IA, Recipe, USEtox, EDIP 2003 and IMPACT 2002+ in midpoint category with a large centralised wastewater treatment plant in Malaysia as a case study. The removal efficiencies of metals and PPCPs/EDCs in the wastewater ranged from 9% to 99% and no dear patterns were found about occurrence and removal efficiencies of metals and PPCPs/EDCs in developing and developed countries. The inclusion of metals and PPCPs/EDCs in effluent resulted in 76% increase in freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEP) and 88% increase in terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TEP) while only 4% increase in human toxicity potential (HTP). The results indicate the importance of including direct emissions such as metals and PPCPs/EDCs even in low-strength municipal wastewater for environmental toxidty assessment. The comparison of five LCIA methods suggests that HTP assessment is more challenging due to inconsistency between five LCIA methods while CML-IA. Recipe, and IMPACT2002+ achieved consistent human toxicity and ecotoxidty assessment results in the WWTP. The results highlight the importance of sampling and inclusion of metals and PPCPs/EDCs data especially prioritised micropollutants for life cycle toxidty assessment and recommends LCIA methods for ecotoxidty assessment of WWTPs in the current scientific development situation on toxicity studies, which can provide guidance to researchers for life cycle toxicity assessment of wastewater treatment.

AB The implementation of the new Water Reuse regulation in the European Union brings to the forefront the need to evaluate the risks of using wastewater for crop irrigation. Here, a two-tier ecotoxicological risk assessment was performed to evaluate the fate of wastewater-borne micropollutants in soil and their ecotoxicological impact on plants and soil microorganisms. To this end, two successive cultivation campaigns of lettuces were irrigated with wastewater (at agronomical dose (not spiked) and spiked with a mixture of 14 pharmaceuticals at 10 and 100 mu g/ L each) in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Over the two cultivation campaigns, an accumulation of PPCPs was observed in soil microcosms irrigated with wastewater spiked with 100 mu g/L of PPCPs with the highest concentrations detected for clarithromycin, hydrochlorothiazide, citalopram, climbazole and carbamazepine. The abundance of bacterial and fungal communities remained stable over the two cultivation campaigns and was not affected by any of the irrigation regimes applied. Similarly, no changes were observed in the abundance of ammonium oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), nor in clade A of commamox no matter the cultivation campaign or the irrigation regime considered. Only a slight increase was detected in clade B of commamox bacteria after the second cultivation campaign. Sulfamethoxazole-resistant and -degrading bacteria were not impacted either. The irrigation regimes had only a limited effect on the bacterial evenness. However, in response to wastewater irrigation the structure of soil bacterial community significantly changed the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaprotebacteria. Twenty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified as responsible for the changes observed within the bacterial communities of soils irrigated with wastewater or with water. Interestingly, the relative abundance of these OTUs was similar in soils irrigated with either spiked or non-spiked irrigation solutions. This indicates that under both agronomical and worst-case scenario the mixture of fourteen PPCPs had no effect on soil bacterial community.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of operational conditions and wastewater properties on the removal of pharmaceuticals, contrast media and antibiotics through ozonation, in order to facilitate the optimization of treatment and its implementation on a full scale. Pilot-scale ozone oxidation trials were performed on treated wastewater, before and after post-precipitation, over a seven-month period, including summer and winter months. Hydraulic retention times as short as 7 min were found to be sufficient for organic micropollutant removal. A short hydraulic retention time reduces both investment costs and land use. Neither the choice of ozone dispersion method, a static mixer or a Venturi injector, nor the wastewater temperature had any significant effect on the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants, however, higher removal was achieved after on-site post-precipitation with aluminum chloride.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of coupling a catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO), with CuO/Al2O3 as catalyst, and an anaerobic/aerobic biological process to treat wastewater from Vitamin B-6 production. Results showed that the CWAO enhanced the biodegradability (BOD5/COD) from 0.10 to 0.80. The oxidized effluents with COD of 10,000 mg l(-1) was subjected to subsequent continuous anaerobic/aerobic oxidation, and 99.3% of total COD removal was achieved. The quality of the effluent obtained met the discharge standards of water pollutants for pharmaceutical industry Chemical Synthesis Products Category (GB21904-2008), and thereby it implies that the integrated CWAO and anaerobic/aerobic biological treatment may offer a promising process to treat wastewater from Vitamin B6 production.

AB Amoxicillin degradation with and without high frequency ultrasound waves of 2.4 MHz has been investigated. The concentration of amoxicillin was selected to be similar to that of outlet wastewater effluent concentration in pharmaceutical industry namely 50 and 100 ppm. The application of ultrasound waves together with the addition of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 increased the rate of degradation of antibiotic amoxicillin. The doses of H2O2 used were 5, 2, 1, and 0.1 ml in a solution of 50 ml of amoxicillin. The study showed that ultrasound waves and H2O2 had improved amoxicillin degradation. The ultrasound has improved the degradation rate more than two times in comparison to amoxicillin solution without ultrasound waves. This degradation rate has been achieved within 90 minutes.

AB Antidepressants are widely used in current times; therefore, they pose a potential risk to ecosystems through the disposal of domestic sewage, even after processing in treatment plants. This study proposes a fast method for the simultaneous determination of commonly used antidepressants (citalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and amitriptyline) and caffeine as an anthropic marker, based on microwave-assisted solvent extraction followed by quantification using HPLC-DAD. The analytical method was validated and considered satisfactory for the simultaneous determination of the analytes in sewage sludge and sediments. No interferences were observed in the retention times of the analytes under study, indicating selectivity. Nevertheless, the study of the matrix effect revealed interference of the sludge and sediment matrices in the sensitivity and accuracy of the analytical method; therefore, calibration by standard addition was employed. The linearity was adequate for the concentration range of 50-800 ng mL(-1), with detection and quantification limits of 15-100 ng g(-1) and 100-250 ng g(-1), respectively. Precision was estimated to be less than 8% in terms of the coefficient of variation. Accuracy was assessed by fortification of sediment and sludge samples at three concentration levels and the recovery range varied from 60 to 99%. The developed and validated method was applied to samples of sewage sludge and sediments obtained from the Itaipu Reservoir region. The results confirm the presence of the analytes in the sewage sludge and indicate that treatment plant residue is a route of insertion of micropollutants into the local environment, because the antidepressants were also found in river sediments.

AB As high quality drinking water becomes scarcer, unintentional indirect potable water reuse, where wastewater effluent is used as a part of a downstream drinking water source, has become a great concern throughout the world. In this case, a variety of organic micro-pollutants contained in wastewater effluent Could create problems. High pressure-driven membranes such as nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) might be a powerful option to deal with such micro-pollutants, however, a lack of information on their performance is apparent. This study examined the ability of RO membranes to retain neutral (uncharged) endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). A total of 11 compounds were chosen so that a certain range of molecular weights and octanol-water distribution coefficients (K-ow) could be studied. With respect to membranes, two different materials (polyamide and cellulose acetate) were examined. Generally, the polyamide membrane exhibited a better performance in terms of the rejection of the selected compounds but the retention was not complete (57-91%). It was found that salt rejection or molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) that are often used to characterize membrane rejection properties did not provide quantitative information in terms of EDCs/PhACs rejection by NF/RO membranes. Molecular weight of the tested compounds could generally indicate the tendency of rejection for the polyamide membranes (size exclusion dominated the retention by the polyamide membrane) while polarity was better able to describe the retention trend of the tested compounds by the cellulose acetate membrane. The results obtained in this study imply that each membrane polymer material for NF/RO membranes, including ones that will be newly developed in the future, Would exhibit different trends in terms of rejection of organic micro-pollutants, which is determined by physico-chemical properties of the compounds.

AB Batch experiments were carried out for 7 days to investigate the simultaneous removal of various organic and inorganic contaminants including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), metals, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and estrogenic activity in wastewater by four freshwater green microalgae species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella vulgaris. After treatment for 7 days, 76.7-92.3% of TN, and 67.5-82.2% of TP were removed by these four algae species. The removal of metals from wastewater by the four algae species varied among the metal species. These four algae species could remove most of the metals efficiently (>40% removal), but showed low efficiencies in removing Pb, Ni and Co. The four algae species were also found to be efficient in removing most of the selected organic compounds with >50% removal, and the estrogenic activity with removal efficiencies ranging from 46.2 to 81.1% from the wastewater. Therefore, algae could be harnessed to simultaneously remove various contaminants in wastewater.

AB For the purpose of the simulation of the kinetics of the reaction of ozone with wastewater in a bubble column, the kinetics can be adequately described by two components and their respective rate constants. Ozone uptake and ozone steady states along a bubble column have been determined. A modeling procedure has been developed that allows us to describe this behavior and to simulate the degradation of micropollutants. For fast (diclofenac) and moderately fast (bezafibrate) reacting micropollutants this model describes their measured elimination well.

ID PESTICIDES; BEHAVIOR; RUNOFF
AB The mode of action of azole compounds implies a potential to affect endocrine systems of different organisms and is reason for environmental concern. The occurrence and fate of nine agricultural azole fungicides, some of them also used as biocides, and four azole pharmaceuticals were studied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and lakes in Switzerland. Two pharmaceuticals (fluconazole, clotrimazole, 10-110 ng L-1) and two biocides (propiconazole, tebuconazole, 1-30 ng L-1) were consistently observed in WWTP influents. Loads determined in untreated and treated wastewater indicated that fluconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole were largely unaffected by wastewater treatment, but clotrimazole was effectively eliminated (> 80%). Incubation studies with activated sludge showed no degradation for fluconazole and clotrimazole within 24 h, but strong sorption of clotrimazole to activated sludge. Slow degradation and some sorption were observed for tebuconazole and propiconazole (degradation half-lives, 2-3 d). In lakes, fluconazole, propiconazole, and tebuconazole were detected at low nanogram-per-liter levels. Concentrations of the pharmaceutical fluconazole correlated with the expected contamination by domestic wastewater, but not those of the biocides. Per capita loads of propiconazole and tebuconazole in lakes suggested additional inputs; for example, from agricultural use or urban runoff rainwater.

Indonesia, using CTAB surfactant by microwave heating. The temperature dependent form of the Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Toth equations was employed to correlate equilibrium data. Based on the evaluation of the physical meaning of fitted isotherm parameters of each model, it is clear that Toth equation can represent the equilibrium data better than other models. The adsorption performance of natural and organo-bentonite for the removal of ampicillin from pharmaceutical company wastewater was also studied. In real wastewater, both adsorbents could not completely remove the ampicillin due to the sorption competition with other substances which also present in the wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the demand for potable water increases, direct potable reuse of wastewater is an attractive alternative method to produce potable water. However, implementation of such a process will require the removal of emerging contaminants which could accumulate in the drinking water supply. Here, the removal of atrazine, a commonly used herbicide, has been investigated. Using real and synthetic wastewater, as well as sludge from two wastewater treatment facilities in the United States in Norman, Oklahoma and Fayetteville, Arkansas, atrazine removal has been investigated. Our results indicate that about 20% of the atrazine is removed by adsorption onto the particulate matter present. Significant biodegradation of atrazine was only observed under aerobic conditions for sludge from Norman, Oklahoma. Next-generation sequencing of the activated sludge revealed the abundance of Noncardiac with known atrazine degradation pathways in the Norman aerobic sludge, which is believed to be responsible for atrazine biodegradation in our study. The detection of these bacteria could also be used to determine the likelihood of biodegradation of atrazine for a given wastewater treatment facility.

AB In this study, the COD removal of Azithromycin from synthetic wastewater (produced to have a composition similar to industrial wastewater) using a Fenton-like (Fe-center dot/H2O2) system in combination with coagulation has been investigated. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was selected as the main parameter to assess treatment efficacy in the current study (COD center dot = 390mg/Lequivalent to 200mg/LAzithromycin). First, the coagulation process was carried out on the synthetic wastewater and the optimum conditions were determined and calculated. According to the results of this experiment, Poly Aluminum Chloride (PAX-18) was selected as the most appropriate coagulant. The results of the coagulation process indicated that COD removal efficacy under the optimum conditions of PAX-18 100mg/Land pH 7.0 was 82.14%. Then, a Fenton-like oxidation process was performed on the effluent of the coagulation process. The optimum conditions were determined and calculated for the Fenton-like process: [Fe-center dot] = 0.36 mM/l, [H2O2]= 0.38 mM/l, and [pH]= 7.0. Finally, in combined treatment (coagulation and the Fenton-like process together), the COD removal rose to 96.89% under optimum conditions. The findings of this study demonstrate that the combined processes of coagulation and Fenton-like oxidation under optimum conditions can play an important role in the COD removal of Azithromycin from industrial wastewater.

AB Pesticides and pharmaceuticals are widely used in modern life and are discharged into wastewater after usage. However, a large number of transformation products (TPs) are formed through abiotic (hydrolysis/photolysis, etc.) and biotic (aerobic/anaerobic degradation by micro-organisms) wastewater treatment processes, and the structure and potential risk of TPs are still unclear. In this study, a suspect and non-target screening was performed to monitor these chemicals with HPLC-QTOF-MS. We identified 60 parent compounds by suspect screening in three Chinese wastewater treatment plants with the commercial database of pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and they were confirmed by authentic standards. Then, suspect and non-target screening strategies based on the predicted diagnostic fragment ions were used to screen TPs of the 60 parent compounds. We tentatively identified 50 TPs and confirmed thirteen of them with authentic standards. Among 13 quantified TPs, about 40% of them showed higher concentration than their parent compounds in effluent. Especially, cloquintocet, as a TP of cloquintocet-mexyl, had a concentration ratio TP/parent = 14,809 in effluent. Twenty-five TPs had higher predicted toxicity than the corresponding parent compounds by calculating their LC50 values towards aquatic organisms using toxicity prediction software. Twenty identified TPs were firstly reported in this study. These results indicate the importance of TP analysis in environmental monitoring in wastewater.

AB In the following study, we came up with and validated a prompt, sensitive and precise method for the simultaneous determination of 56 antimicrobial drugs (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, macrolides and quinolones) using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). This method was implemented with success to determine antibiotics in samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants and five coasts in Tunisia. Results showed the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics that ranged from 0.1 to 646 ng mL(-1), which can induce many negative impacts on health and the environment. For this reason, we have opted to evaluate toxicity of wastewater samples using a battery of biotests. In fact, genotoxicity was assessed using three tests: Vitotox, comet and micronucleus assays. The input and output of wastewater treatment plants induced a strongly genotoxic effect on the Salmonella typhimurium TA104 prokaryotic Vitotox assay. This result was confirmed using the comet and the micronucleus assays performed on the human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The genotoxic power of the tested wastewater treatment plants' samples could be attributed to the presence of the higher quantities of antibiotics that are detected in these samples and to the antibiotic and organic compound cocktails.

AB Samples from several wastewater treatment facilities in Wisconsin were screened for the presence of 21 antibiotic compounds. These facilities spanned a range of community size served (average daily flow from 0.0212 to 23.6 million gallons/day), secondary treatment processes, geographic locations across the state, and they discharged the treated effluents to both surface and ground waters (for ground water after a soil passage). A total of six antibiotic compounds were detected (1-5 compounds per site), including two sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole), one tetracycline (tetracycline), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin), macrolide (erythromycin-H2O) and trimethoprim. The frequency of detection of antibiotics was in the following order: tetracycline and trimethoprim (80%)> sulfamethoxazole (70%)> erythromycin-H2O (45%)> ciprofloxacin (40%) > sulfamethazine (10%). However, the soluble concentrations were in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range (<= 1.3 mu g/L), and importantly were unaffected by the size of the wastewater treatment facility. The concentrations detected were within an order of magnitude of those reported for similar systems in Europe and Canada: they were within a factor of two in comparison to those reported for Canada but generally lower relative to those measured in wastewater systems in Europe. Only sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were detected in groundwater monitoring wells adjacent to the treatment systems. Future intensive wastewater monitoring programs in Wisconsin may be limited to the six antibiotic compounds detected in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in bodies of water worldwide, yet their effects on the environment are not fully understood. Recent toxicity studies suggest that mixtures of PPCPs at low concentrations may be detrimental to exposed organisms, highlighting the need to remove PPCPs from wastewater treatment plant effluent before it is discharged to the environment. In this study, the utility of biofilm-based PPCP removal as a means to prevent environmental PPCP contamination was investigated. The removal of 14 PPCPs, each at an initial concentration of 10 mu g/L, was studied in laboratory sand columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. The examined PPCPs included biosol, biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, p-chloro-m-xylenol, chlorophene, sodium diclofenac, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, triclosan, and valproic acid. Ten of the PPCPs were removed by greater than 95% during column passage, while the four other compounds proved more recalcitrant. The effect of the concentration (either 50 or 1000 mu g/L) of an easily degradable primary substrate (acetate) supplied along with the mixture of PPCPs was examined. Most of the tested PPCPs were removed consistently by the biofilms regardless of the concentration of acetate, although the extent of removal for three compounds showed dependence on acetate concentration, and two behaved with no reproducible pattern over time. Biofilm protein measurements indicated that the mixture of PPCPs supplied to columns suppressed biofilm growth, suggesting toxicity of the PPCPs to the biofilm communities. This laboratory-scale experiment suggests that biofilm-based water treatment strategies, such as soil aquifer treatment and slow sand filtration, may be well-suited for the removal of many PPCPs from impacted water.

AB Several studies have assessed the presence of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in reclaimed wastewater and their uptake into crops but there are limited data from field-scale studies. In this research, we studied the fate of 12 TrOCs in wastewater samples, 11 in plants and in soil pore water, and 10 in soil at an agricultural research farm, which was irrigated with reclaimed wastewater for more than 10 years. First, we examined the presence of the compounds in the primary, secondary, and treated effluent of a regional water reclamation facility which provides the irrigation water. The agricultural field produced alfalfa, and we measured the contaminants in the alfalfa, soil, and pore water. Reclaimed wastewater contained 11 of 12 TrOCs, with concentrations ranging from 26 +/- 9 ng/L (DEET) to 1539 +/- 1899 ng/L (trimethoprim). Atrazine was not detected. Pore water collected during non-irrigating periods contained all analyzed TrOCs, from 3 +/- 0.1 ng/L (diphenhydramine) to 343 +/- 360 ng/L ( primidone). TrOCs measured in pore water samples indicated that they may leach to shallow groundwater even when fields are not being irrigated. Soils from 0 to 60 cm contained nine TrOCs from below the reporting limit (fluoxetine) to 329 ng/g (carbamazepine). Atrazine was not detected. TrOC concentrations decreased with increasing soil depth, except carbamazepine, which was more recalcitrant. Nine TrOCs were present in the shoots and leaves of alfalfa grown in the reclaimed wastewater irrigated plots, at concentrations ranging from <1 ng/g (diphenhydramine and fluoxetine) to 49 ng/g dry weight (carbamazepine). Atrazine and caffeine were not detected. We estimated that a maximum of 14% of DEET from the reclaimed wastewater was accumulated in alfalfa. Overall, despite some accumulation ofTrOCs in the soil, alfalfa uptake was limited, which results in low exposure to foraging animals. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely detected recalcitrant pharmaceutical in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent, has been studied in the present work using combination of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Due to its recalcitrant nature, it cannot be removed effectively by the conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which make CBZ a pharmaceutical of very high environmental relevance and impact as well as stressing the need for developing new treatment schemes. In the present study, the effect of inlet pressure (3-5 bar) and operating pH (3-11) on the extent of degradation have been initially studied with an objective of maximizing the degradation using HC alone. The established optimum conditions as pressure of 4 bar and pH of 4 resulted in maximum degradation of CBZ as 38.7%. The combined approaches of HC with ultraviolet irradiation (HC + UV), hydrogen peroxide (HC + H2O2), ozone (HC + O-3) as well as combination of HC, H2O2 and O-3 (HC + H2O2 + O-3) have been investigated under optimized pressure and operating pH. It was observed that a significant increase in the extent of degradation is obtained for the combined operations of HC + H2O2 + O-3, HC + O-3, HC + H2O2, and HC + UV with the actual extent of degradation being 100%, 91.4%, 58.3% and 52.9% respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed that degradation of CBZ fitted into first order kinetics model for all the approaches. The processes were also compared on the basis of cavitational yield and also in terms of total treatment cost. Overall, it has been demonstrated that combined process of HC, H2O2 and O-3 can be effectively used for treatment of wastewater containing CBZ.

AB The short half-life of aminopenicillin antibiotics in the aquatic environment put to the challenge the detection of their degradation products among environmental hydro-chemists. In a quest to study the occurrence of a new emerging micro-pollutant in the aquatic environmentwe attempted this by analyzing samples from a wastewater treatment plant for a major degradation product of amoxicillin (i.e., amoxicillin-diketopiperazine-2', 5') using a high-performance liquid chromatography technique coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method. ADP was repeatedly detected in all wastewater and effluent samples (18) from which it was extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evidently proves the occurrence of the chemically stable form of AMX, its Diketopiperazine-2', 5', in wastewater and effluent samples. Furthermore, penicillins are known to cause most allergic drug reactions. There is a risk that residues of hypersensitivity-inducing drugs, such as penicillins and their degradation products, may elicit allergic reactions in human consumers of water and food of animal origin.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are generally poorly removed during conventional wastewater treatment. There is a need for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive methods to monitor the quality of treated wastewater effluent. The purpose of this study was to assess the applicability of the LuminoTox as a tool to monitor municipal secondary effluent (SE) and to determine its sensitivity to the presence of CECs.The effect of exposure method on a 14 CECs mix was explored; 20 min in the dark or 30 min under light were both recommended as they were sensitive to the detection of CECs in wastewater while providing a short run time. Stabilized aqueous photosynthetic systems (SAPS) detected the 14 CECs mix in the wastewater matrices when they were present at a concentration in the 6 mu g/L to 50 mu g/L range. Interference on the biosensors were examined in a range of wastewater characteristics commonly observed in SE and, for most cases, biosensors were not inhibited which suggests that, in most cases, wastewater characteristics would not cause toxic interferences. SAPS detected CECs in SE with different modes of action with the degree of sensitivity of individual CECs developed from experimental and literature values as follows: inhibitors of the plastoquinone binding site within photosystem II > direct or indirect inhibitors of photosynthesis acting on binding sites other than that of the QB. SAPS were assessed for their ability to detect residual CECs in SE without sample preparation, however, the effluent examined exhibited minimal inhibition for SAPS II (7 +/- 1%) and no inhibition for SAPS I. These results highlight the need for the development of a sample pre-concentration method to increase the biosensor sensitivity towards native CECs. This would allow the LuminoTox to be an effective tool for monitoring wastewater quality with the intent of residual CECs detection. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, performance of a lab-scale hybrid up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, was evaluated under different operating conditions. This study consisted of two experimental stages: first, acclimation to the pharmaceutical wastewater and second, determination of maximum loading capacity of the hybrid UASB reactor. Initially, the carbon source in the reactor feed came entirely from glucose, applied at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1 kg COD/m(3) d. The OLR was gradually step increased to 3 kg COD/m(3) d at which point the feed to the hybrid UASB reactor was progressively modified by introducing the pharmaceutical wastewater in blends with glucose, so that the wastewater contributed approximately 10%, 30%, 70%, and ultimately, 100% of the carbon (COD) to be treated. At the acclimation OLR of 3 kg COD/m(3) d the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 2 days. During this period of feed modification, the COD removal efficiencies of the anaerobic reactor were 99%, 96%, 91% and 85%, and specific methanogenic activities (SMA) were measured as 240, 230, 205 and 231 ml CH4/g TVS d, respectively. Following the acclimation period, the hybrid UASB reactor was fed with 100% (w/v) pharmaceutical wastewater up to an OLR of 9 kg COD/m(3) d in order to determine the maximum loading capacity achievable before reactor failure. At this OLR, the COD removal efficiency was 28%, and the SMA was measured as 170 ml CH4/g TVS d. The hybrid UASB reactor was found to be far more effective at an OLR of 8 kg COD/m(3) d with a COD removal efficiency of 72%. At this point, SMA value was 200 ml CH4/g TVS d. It was concluded that the hybrid UASB reactor could be a suitable alternative for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many novel treatment technologies, usually representing a pre-treatment prior to the biological degradation process, have been developed in order to improve the recycling and reuse of sewage sludge. Among all the methods available, a chemical (alkaline) and a thermal treatment have been considered in this study. The behaviour of 13 substances belonging to different therapeutic classes (musks, tranquillisers, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, X-ray contrast media and estrogens) has been studied during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge combined with these pre-treatments (advanced operation) in comparison with the conventional process. Two parameters have been analysed; the temperature (mesophilic and thermophilic conditions) and the sludge retention time. While organic matter solubilization was higher with the alkaline process (55-80%), no difference between both pre-treatments was observed concerning volatile solids solubilization (up to 20%). The removal efficiencies of solids and organic matter during anaerobic digestion ranged from 40-70% and 45-75%, respectively. The higher removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and personal. care products were achieved for the antibiotics, Naproxen and the natural estrogens (> 80%). For the other compounds, the values were in the range 20-70%, except for Carbamazepine, which was not removed at any condition tested.

AB A laboratory-scale sulfate-reducing fluidized bed reactor at a controlled mesophilic condition of +/- 28 degrees C examined the biotreatment process of real acid mine drainage and hospital wastewater. In an attempt to substitute the carbon source, the study used the hospital wastewater in this regard. In this study, there was no supplement of carbon source during the treatment, but only the hospital wastewater provided the dissolved organic carbon. The process evaluated a biological treatment efficiency in stepwise phases, monitoring the effect of retention time, influent pH, and sulfates. The overall removal for the effluent COD concentrations and sulfate were between 39.5 mg/l and 42 mg/l at COD/SO42- ratio of 0.68 and hydraulic retention time of 8 h. The overall COD oxidation and sulfate reduction performance of the reactor was recorded as an average of 96 % and 97 %, correspondingly. The sulfide concentration averaged 235 mg/l, and the alkalinity generated in sulfidogenic organic from hospital wastewater neutralized the acid in mine water. The metal removal efficiencies documented at HRT of 8 h, were all above 98 %. The biological treatment further recorded the removal efficiencies of 44 % for naproxen and 55 % for ibuprofen pharmaceutical compounds as an additional advantage to the system.

AB High concentrations of antibiotics in wastewater can promote antibiotic resistance during -biological wastewater treatment. In this work, ozonation was evaluated regarding its removal efficiency of -antibiotic, antimicrobial activity, and antibiotic resistance selection potency from oxytetracycline (OTC) production wastewater. Doses of 0.4 and 1.2 mg O-3 per mg of initial OTC permitted 100% and 92% OTC removal from OTC solution (OTC, 10 mg/L) and OTC production waste mother liquor (OTC, 702 mg/L), respectively. With the removal of OTC, the OTC solution lost its antibacterial -activity against Streptococcus aureus. The antibiotic resistance selection potency of OTC before and after ozonation was also evaluated. When activated sludge was exposed to OTC (10 mg/L) solution for 18 d, the OTC-resistant bacteria ratio increased from 2.0% to 28.2%, and the relative abundances of tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(X)) and class 1 integron increased from 1.01% to 5.36% (p < 0.05). However, no significant change of OTC resistance was observed in activated sludge exposed to ozonated OTC solution, implying that the antibiotic resistance selection potency of OTC was alleviated by ozonation. This study demonstrated that ozonation can reduce antibiotic resistance selection potency from OTC production wastewater with a reasonable ozone dose.

AB This work aimed at decontaminating biologically treated domestic wastewater effluent from pharmaceutical residues by using sulphate radical based homogeneous photo-Fenton involving persulphate (PS) as an oxidant, ferrous iron (Fe(II)) as a catalyst and simulated solar irradiation as a light source. This is the first time that the beneficiary use of solar energy in PS/Fe(II)/UV-Vis system was evaluated by using carbamazepine (CBZ) as a probe compound. In wastewater, CBZ was fully degraded in 30 min for an initial CBZ concentration of 50 mu M and an optimal PS:Fe(II) molar ratio of 2:1 thanks to the high selectivity in reactivity of the sulphate radical limiting scavenging effects of organic matter and inorganic ions. Seventeen by-products were identified using liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry allowing for the establishment of degradation pathways. CBZ first underwent degradation through one electron transfer oxidation processes due to sulphate radical reactivity followed by hydroxylation processes through hydroxyl radical formed by Fe(III) photoreduction. The sequential generation of sulphate radical and hydroxyl radical has made PS/Fe(II)/UV Vis a kinetically effective process in removing CBZ from wastewater without the accumulation of toxic intermediates and opens new remediation strategies for tertiary treatment in domestic wastewater treatment plants.

AB Hospital wastewater is an important source of emerging contaminants. Recent studies emphasize the importance of assessing the effects of mixtures of contaminants rather than environmental risk of their individual components, as well as the determination of intrinsic toxicity of wastewater. Mixtures of pollutants has possible interactions that have notable environmental side effects. The aim of this study is an attempt to characterize biomarkers in Cyprinus carpio related to the exposure to a complex mixture of contaminants found in hospital wastewater. Results of a particular hospital effluent show the presence of traces of heavy metals, high chlorine concentration and emerging contaminants such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The LC50 was of 5.49 % at 96 h. The cytotoxic, genotoxic and apoptotic biomarkers increase when fishes were exposed to wastewater (1/10 CL50) from hospital wastewater. This study emphasizes the importance of identifying and quantifying the effects of contaminants as pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and surfactants in order to design and implement an ecotoxicologycal plan.

AB Wastewater impoundments at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) represent a potential source of veterinary pharmaceuticals and steroid hormone contamination to shallow groundwater. This study investigates the occurrence of seventeen veterinary pharmaceuticals and thirteen steroid hormones and hormone metabolites in lagoons and adjacent groundwater at operating swine and beef cattle facilities. These sites were chosen because subsurface geology and previous monitoring of nitrate, ammonia and chloride levels in shallow ground water strongly indicated direct infiltration, and as such represent worst cases for ground water contamination by waste water. Pharmaceutical compounds detected in samples obtained from cattle facilities include sulfamerazine; sulfamethazine; erythromycin; monensin; tiamulin; and sulfathiazole. Lincomycin; ractopamine; sulfamethazine; sulfathiazole; erythromycin; tiamulin and sulfadimethoxine were detected in wastewater samples obtained from swine facilities. Steroid hormones were detected less frequently than veterinary pharmaceuticals in this study. Estrone, testosterone, 4-androstenedione, and androsterone were detected in wastewater impoundments at concentrations ranging from 30 to 3600 ng/L, while only estrone and testosterone were detected in groundwater samples at concentrations up to 390 ng/L The co-occurrence of veterinary pharmaceutical and steroid hormone contamination in groundwater at these locations and the correlation between pharmaceutical occurrence in lagoon wastewater and hydraulically downgradient groundwater indicates that groundwater underlying some livestock wastewater impoundments is susceptible to contamination by veterinary pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones originating in wastewater lagoons.

AB An analysis of wastewater from Krakow (Poland) for the presence of controlled and uncontrolled stimulant drugs of abuse was performed. Samples were collected from the Plaszow wastewater treatment plant, Krakow, Poland, and prepared by solid phase extraction. The LC-QTOFMS method was applied for identification and quantification of popular stimulants: MDMA, mephedrone, 4-MEC, MDPV and mCPP. Environmental loads of illicit drugs were calculated; the WWTP discharged loads ranging from 3.6 to 6.7 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of MDMA, 3.6 to 7.1 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of mephedrone and 4.8 to 5.8 mg day(-1) 1000 inhabitants(-1) of 4-MEC. The results confirmed the growing popularity of new psychoactive substances in Poland.

AB In this study, laboratory-scale experiments were conducted applying a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) activated sludge process to a wastewater stream from a pharmaceutical factory. Nitrogen removal can be achieved via partial nitrification and denitrification and the efficiency was above 99% at 23degreesC +/- 1. The experimental results indicated that the nitrite oxidizers were more sensitive than ammonia oxidizers to the free ammonia in the wastewater. The average accumulation rate of nitrite was much higher than that of nitrate. During nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway, the end of nitrification and denitrification can be exactly decided by monitoring the variation of pH. Consequently, on-line control for nitrogen removal from the pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater can be achieved and the cost of operation can be reduced.

AB Occurrence of emerging contaminants in the environment reveals a growing problem, attributed to uncontrolled disposal or insufficient elimination of those pollutants during wastewater treatment. The possession of efficient and competent analytical tools is important in order to examine the root of this problem. In the present study, an analytical method was developed for the determination of selected endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical compounds in activated sludge (biosolids). The following ten compounds, triclosan, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, bisphenol A, estrone, 17-beta-estradiol, 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, androsterone, 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one and 19-norethindrone were examined and finally included in the analytical method described. Target compounds were isolated from sludge by ultrasound extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The desorption of the analytes from the SPME fiber was carried out by gas chromatography, while identification and quantitation was achieved with mass spectroscopy. For the development and validation of the method, sludge standards were created by spiking target compounds in dewatered sludge. The metabolic activity of activated sludge was interrupted without changing the structure of the biomass, in order to imitate real sorption conditions that exist in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Concerning the optimization of the extraction process, several parameters were investigated, including the type of organic solvent used, duration of the ultrasound extraction, purification of the extract. The limits of detection for examined compounds ranged between 4 and 50 ng g (1) (biomass, dry weight). The method was applied for the determination of the selected compounds in sludge samples collected from large scale municipal on the island of Crete (Greece). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence of 31 selected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in Korean surface waters was investigated. The area was selected since there is a lack of information in the Seoul area on the suspected contamination of rivers by micropollutants, although over 99% of drinking water is produced from surface waters in this area that has a population of approximately 15 million inhabitants. Samples were collected from upstream/downstream and effluent-dominated creeks along the Han River, Seoul (South Korea) and analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). Most target compounds were detected in both the Han River samples (63%) and the effluent-dominated creek samples (79%). lopromide, atenolol, TCPP, TECP, musk ketone, naproxen, DEET, carbamazepine, caffeine, and benzophenone were frequently detected in both river and creek samples, although the mean concentrations in effluent-dominated creek samples (102 ng/L-3745 ng/L) were significantly higher than those in river samples (56 ng/L-1013 ng/L). However, the steroid hormones 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. were not detected (<1 ng/L) in both the river and creek samples. Numerous target compounds (15) were found to be positively correlated (over 0.8) to the conventional water quality parameters (chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, and ultraviolet absorbance). Results of this study provide increasing evidence that certain EDCs and PPCPs commonly occur in the Han River as the result of wastewater outfalls. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Globally, herbal pharmaceutical industries are among the leading pharmaceutical industries. They generate large volume of wastewater during processing and production, which is highly biodegradable in nature and cannot be discharged into environment as such. Hence efforts are being made to evaluate the toxicity of herbal pharmaceutical effluents using green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda. Physico-chemically treated effluents (PCTEs.) as well as biologically treated effluents (BTEs) were observed after the application of S. quadricauda. Also, S. quadricauda showed higher growth rate after the addition of PCTE and BTE. The highest yield of algae was observed in BTE up to 15 days of incubation by synthesis of chlorophyll and cell metabolites, even with 10-100% dilution of effluents. The present study also discusses the evaluation of biotoxicity and recycling on herbal pharmaceutical wastewater along with heavy metal removal.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are the main sources of a broad spectrum of pharmaceuticals found in freshwater ecosystems. These pollutants raise environmental health concerns because of their highly bioactive nature and their chronic releases. Despite this, pharmaceuticals' effects on aquatic environments are poorly defined. Biofilms represent a major part of the microbial life in rivers and streams. They can drive key metabolic cycles and their organizations reflect exposures to changing chemical, physical, and biological constraints. This study estimated the concentrations, over a 3-year period, of ten pharmaceuticals and five nutrients in a river contaminated by a conventional WWTP fed by urban and hospital wastewaters. Variations in these concentrations were related to biofilm bacterial community dynamics. Rock biofilms had developed over defined periods and were harvested at four locations in the river from the up- and downstream WWTP discharge point. Pharmaceuticals were found in all locations in concentrations ranging from not being detected to 192 ng L-1. Despite the high dilution factor of the WWTP effluents by the receiving river, pharmaceuticals were found more concentrated downstream than upstream the WWTP. Shifts in bacterial community structures linked to the environmental emission of pharmaceuticals were superior to seasonal community changes. A community structure from a site located downstream but close to the WWTP was more strongly associated with high pharmaceutical loads and different from those of biofilm samples from the WWTP upstream or far downstream sites. These latter sites were more strongly associated with high nutrient contents. Low environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals can thus be transferred from WWTP effluents to a connected stream and induce bacterial aquatic community changes over time.

AB Dynamic influent models, which have been proposed to test control strategies using virtual wastewater treatment plants, should be as realistic as possible. The number of inhabitants in the catchment at any given time and their ways of life are among the parameters affecting the quality of these models. Census data related to work and school commutes were used to evaluate the number of people present in a given urban area. Based on the example of a large urban catchment (Grand Nancy, France), the results show that a population increase of 30% could occur during working hours resulting from the imbalance between workers leaving and coming into the catchment. Combined with information related to the local way of life, variation in the population helps to explain changes in wastewater flow rate and pollution (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals), which present several maxima reflecting daily activities, such as bladder voiding, meals, the use of washrooms, etc. However, no well-defined variation patterns for pH and conductivity, which are linked to the concentrations of anions and cations in the wastewater, were observed. Slight reductions (up to 10% on Sundays) in the flow and pollution load were observed on weekends as the commuter flow decreased. Census data proved to be efficient in helping to understand the daily pattern of urban wastewater characteristics. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the degradation of nonbiodegradable organic pollutants in biologically cephalosporin pharmaceutical wastewater using different electrodes such as non-nano-scale electrode (traditional coated), nano-scale (nano-coated) electrode, and perforated electrode after biotreatment. The traditional coated electrode plate, nano-coated electrode plate, and two different perforated titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrode plates with an average pore size of 10 mm and 20 mm were chosen as the anode. The results demonstrated that traditional coated electrode, nano-scale electrode, and perforated electrode could effectively remove nonbiodegradable organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater. The perforated electrode with an average pore size of 10 mm exhibited the best degradation effect with a 90 % decrease in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) (COD content reduced from 320 mg L-1 to 32 mg L-1). During catalytic degradation, the electrical conductivity of pharmaceutical wastewater increased and the pH increased and finally reached equilibrium. It was also found that the perforated TiO2 electrode produced relatively large amounts of dissolved oxygen during the catalytic oxidation process, reaching above 4 mg L-1, whereas the nano-coated electrode produced little dissolved oxygen. The biotoxicities of all wastewater samples increased firstly then decreased slightly during the electrical catalytic oxidation, but the final biotoxicities were all higher than initial ones.

AB Wastewaters are increasingly being reused in public spaces to supplant the use of potable water. In this study we investigated possible trace organic contaminants in wastewater from a dairy factory applied to a recreation reserve. Samples were taken of recycled dairy factory wastewater used to irrigate the reserve and from the subsurface drainage system after irrigation and after rainfall. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, it was found that irrigation drainage mostly contained different compounds to those in rainfall drainage. This drainage water was found to contain residues of three agrochemicals (dicamba, 0.4 +/- 0.07 mu g/l; (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-acetic acid, 0.4 +/- 0.05 mu g/l; and tetrachloronitroanisole, 0.4 +/- 0.09 mu g/l). Pharmaceuticals were also detected in the wastewater applied to the reserve as was an isomer of dicamba. However these compounds appear to have come from urban or agricultural runoff rather than the factory wastewater. Compounds detected of a possible natural origin included syringicaldehyde (0.06-0.2 mu g/l), and the metabolites 3-methoxy-4-acetoxycinnamic acid (0.1-1.0 mu g/l) and tau-oxo-benzene butanoic acid (0.09-0.1 mu g/l). The reuse of appropriately treated wastewater from the dairy factory can be benign to the reserve and downstream environment but understanding the source of any contaminants is important.

AB Polycyclic and nitro musk (PNM) fragrances in personal care products persist and bioaccumulate in the environment following wastewater discharges and land application of biosolids. Influent and effluent concentrations, seasonal variations, and process removal efficiencies of 11 PNMs were investigated at six wastewater treatment plants representing four typical Canadian treatment processes: lagoon, oxidation ditch, extended aeration, and conventional activated sludge. Influent concentrations were as high as 40 000 ng/L for polycyclic musks and 400 ng/L for nitro musks, and showed some seasonal fluctuation. Effluent concentrations were as high as 4000 ng/L and 150 ng/L for polycyclic and nitro musks, respectively. Lagoon treatment produced the highest percent removal (> 95%) and the lowest effluent concentrations of PNMs, with process temperature exerting some influence on removal. Results indicate that simple hydraulic or solids retention time are not strong predictors of PNM removals from wastewater. Effluent PNM concentrations were extrapolated to all treatment plants in the watershed to estimate concentrations along the Grand River and its tributaries.

AB Wastewater reclamation processes, including membrane bio reactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane, have been built, and those processes were independently operated, under recycling conditions, to compare the performances, with respect to contaminants removal and fouling minimization. The hydrophilic fractions of organic matter were more effectively removed than the hydrophobic fraction through the system due to microbial activities in the MBR, as measured using three dimensional fluorescence excitation and emission spectra. Furthermore, levels of nitrogen compounds, micropollutants, metals, and metalloid were substantially reduced by the applied MBR and NF system. These observations were in good agreements with patterns in molecular weight distributions and fluorescence spectra. The major components of membrane fouling in the system for wastewater reclamation were the hydrophilic fractions; high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, fluorescence and infrared spectra, and XAD 8/4 resins revealed that the hydrophilic fractions (non-humic substances), comprising of protein-like substances and saccharide groups, are responsible for serious membrane fouling in the tested system for wastewater reclamation.

AB 3,4-dimethyl-aniline is a stubborn organic matter and widely appears in many industrial wastewaters. A novel method Hybrid Photo-electrocatalytic Oxidation (HPECO) combining Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) with Electrocatalytic Oxidation (ECO) was established to treat it. The removal efficiencies were compared among HPECO, PCO and ECO systems and the result suggested HPECO was 2.45 and 1.14 times higher than the sum of other two systems for 3,4-DMA and TOC removals, separately. Furthermore, a three-stage mechanism was proposed in HPECO process by cyclic voltammetry, ESR and quantitative determination of HClO and a whole degradation pathway was deduced by GC-MS. In the first stages, HClO attacked the side chains of 3,4-DMA and oxidized it into 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2-amino-6-methylbenzoic acid and 1,2,4-benzoic acid. In the last two stages, these intermediates were further degraded until mineralization, under the co-oxidation of chlorine radical species (CRS) and (OH)-O-center dot. In addition, synergistic effect was studied with generating reason and controlling factors. UV irradiation and applied voltage could increase the yields of (OH)-O-center dot and CRS. Electrochemical process could also accelerate the production of (OH)-O-center dot through O-2 evolution reaction. The existence of (OH)-O-center dot could facilitate the transform of 3,4-DMA into the intermediates containing -COOH groups, which provided the bridge substances for CRS and HClO to achieve the rapid selective oxidation. The further investigation found that synergistic effect was positively correlated with current density and negative correlated with pH and UV power. Finally, pharmaceutical wastewater was treated with this novel method and it can be successfully removed to meet the Chinese national sewage discharge standard after 30 h degradation.

AB The occurrence and spatial distribution of 158 pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse were studied in seawater of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Saronikos Gulf and Elefsis Bay in central Aegean Sea). This area is affected by various anthropogenic pressures as it receives the treated wastewater of the greatest Athens area and off-shore input fluxes. This study constitutes the largest one in terms of number of analytes in this environmental compartment. It provides the first evidence on the occurrence of several pharmaceuticals in marine environment including amoxicillin, lidocaine, citalopram or tramadol, among others.
   22 samples were collected at three different depths in 9 sampling stations in order to assess the presence and the spatial distribution of the target compounds. A multi-residue method based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of the 158 target substances and validated for seawater sample analysis. 38 out of the 158 target compounds were detected, 15 of them with frequencies of detection equal to or higher than 50%. The highest detected values corresponded to amoxicillin, caffeine and salicylic acid, with concentrations in the range of <5.0-127.8 ng L-1; 5.2-78.2 ng L-1 and <0.4-53.3 ng L-1, respectively. Inputs from the wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) of Athens revealed to be the main source of pollution in the Inner Saronikos Gulf, whereas, other anthropogenic pressures such as contamination from shipping activity, industrial effluents, dredging and/or inputs from land proved to be also relevant. The concentrations of some compounds varied significantly with depth suggesting that currents play an important role in the dilution of the target compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence and elimination of 19 micro-organic pollutants including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in a full-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic-membrane bioreactor process was investigated. The investigated process achieved over 70% removal of the target EDCs and 50%-100% removal of most of the PPCPs, with influent concentration ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. Three PPCPs, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulpiride were not well removed, with the removal efficiency below 20%. A rough mass balance suggests that the targets were eliminated through sludge-adsorption and/or biodegradation, the former of which was particularly significant for the removal of hydrophobic compounds. The two-phase fate model was employed to describe the kinetics of sludge-adsorption and biodegradation. It was found that the fast sludge adsorption (indicated by mass-transfer rates greater than 10 for most compounds) is responsible for the rapid decline of the aqueous concentration of the targets in the first compartment of the treatment process (i.e. in the anaerobic tank). In contrast, the slow biodegradation proved to be the rate-determining step for the entire degradation process, and the rates are generally positively related to the dissolved oxygen level. On the other hand, this study showed that the removal rates of most targets can reach a quasi-plateau in 5 h under aerobic conditions, indicating that hydraulic retention time of ca. 5 h in aerobic tanks should be sufficient for the elimination of most targets.

AB We developed a rapid method for the monitoring of five selected pharmaceuticals in the influent and effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as well as in the effluent-receiving waters. To that end, we optimized and validated an analytical method based on on-line solid-phase extraction (on-line SPE) coupled with reversed-phase liquid chromatography-switching polarity electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+/-)-MS/MS). The target analytes have a variable hydrophobic character and belong to various therapeutic classes including the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the chemotherapy drugs methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril. The method combines positive and negative voltage switching modes, therefore all analytes can be determined using a single injection and without any reduction in sensitivity. In order to detect traces of these compounds, a preconcentration step before detection is performed by loading 1.00 mL of sample in an on-line SPE cartridge and eluting from the cartridge using a reversed-phase liquid chromatography gradient. Analysis of wastewater and surface water samples was greatly affected by co-eluting matrix compounds, to compensate for matrix effects quantitation was therefore performed using standard additions. Method intra-day precision was less than 6.5% and limits of detection in fortified matrix effluent samples ranged from 9 to 20 ng L-1. Four of the target pharmaceuticals were detected in the WWTP effluents, enalapril and bezafibrate being the most abundant compounds with concentrations of 35 and 239 ng L-1, respectively. Concentrations of these same compounds in surface water samples from sites downstream in the St. Lawrence River were 8 and 63 ng L-1, respectively, which was mainly due to dilution.

AB A comprehensive study, which contains the seasonal occurrence, removal, mass loading and environmental risk assessment of 55 multi-class pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), took place in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Volos, Greece. A one year monitoring study was performed and the samples were collected from the influent and the effluent of the WWTP. Solid phase extraction was used for the pre-concentration of the samples followed by an LC-DAD-ESI/MS analysis. Positive samples were further confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The maximum concentrations of the PPCPs varied between 21 ng/L and 15,320 ng/L in the influents and between 18 ng/L and 9965 ng/L in the effluents. The most commonly detected PPCPs were the diuretic furosemide, the beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol, the analgesics paracetamol, nimesulide, salicylic add and diclofenac and the psychomotor stimulant caffeine. The removal efficiencies ranged between negative and high removal rates, demonstrating that the WWTP is not able to efficiently remove the complex mixture of PPCPs. The estimated mass loads ranged between 5.1 and 3513 mg/day/1000 inhabitants for WWTP influent and between 4.1 to 2141 mg/day/1000 inhabitants for WWTP effluent. Finally, environmental risk assessment has been regarded a necessary part of the general research. According to the results produced from the calculation of the risk quotient on three trophic levels, the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the antibiotics, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin, identified to be of high potential environmental risk for acute toxicity, while didofenac also for chronic toxicity.

AB The discharge of emerging contaminants (ECs) from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment is a matter of great importance due to the potential adverse effects that they can exert on aquatic biota. This study assesses the capacity of 12 full-scale horizontal-flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) (18,000 m(2) in total) used as tertiary treatment to remove 16 ECs from secondary treated wastewater( 423,500 PE). Benzotriazole, 5-methylbenzotriazole, ketoprofen, and diclofenac were the most abundant(>2000 ng L-1 on average) in the secondary treated wastewater effluent. EC removal levels ranged from no removal to 92%, with an average removal of 43%. A significant relationship was observed between the removal of ECs in the HFCWs and their log Kow and molecular weight. The HFCWs were able to attenuate the predicted ecotoxicological effects of ECs on aquatic biota (Daphnia magna) by 66%. This study indicates that HFCWs are suitable for removing ECs from WWTP effluents and, therefore, reduce the ecotoxicological effects associated with pollutant discharges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Benchtop bioreactors were run aerobically with activated sludge samples collected from a large municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to understand how increased hydraulic retention time (HRT), sludge retention time (SRT), and varying treatment temperatures (21 degrees C and 30 degrees C) impact concentrations of the endocrine disrupting antimicrobials triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), and their transformation products. Samples from the reactors were collected periodically over a 122-196 h period and the solid and liquid fraction were separately quantitated for TCS, TCC, and methyltriclosan (MeTCS) and scanned qualitatively for six other transformation products. Results indicated that TCS, TCC and MeTCS were predominately associated with the solids fraction of the activated sludge with only nominal concentrations in the liquids fraction. TCS was degraded in the solids fraction, with increased rates at 30 degrees C (- 0.0224 +/- 0.007 h(-1)) when compared to reactors run at 21 degrees C (- 0.0170 +/- 0.003 h(-1)). Conversely, TCC concentrations did not significantly change in solids samples from reactors run at 21 degrees C, while an increase in reactor temperature to 30 degrees C resulted in TCC degradation at an average rate of - 0.0158 +/- 0.012 h(-1). Additionally, MeTCS formation in the solids fraction was observed in three out of four reactors run - indicating a notable transformation of TCS. Qualitative appearance of 2,4-dichlorophenol and 4-chloroanaline was observed in the liquids fraction of all reactor samples. The remaining four qualitatively scanned compounds were not detected. These experiments demonstrate that increased HRT, SRT, and temperature result in enhanced removal of TCS and TCC from wastewater during the activated sludge process. Furthermore, a substantial formation of TCS into MeTCS was observed.

AB This study aimed to investigate the removal mechanisms of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) and musks in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Biological removal and adsorption in the activated sludge tank as well as the effect of UV radiation used for disinfection purposes were considered when performing a mass balance on the WWTP throughout a 2-week sampling campaign.
   Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was carried out to analyse the PhACs in the influent and effluent samples. Ultrasonic solvent extraction was used before SPE for PhACs analysis in sludge samples. PhAC extracts were analysed by LC-MS. Solid-phase microextraction of liquid and sludge samples was used for the analysis of musks, which were detected by GC-MS. The fluxes of the most abundant compounds (13 PhACs and 5 musks) out of 79 compounds studied were used to perform the mass balance on the WWTP.
   Results show that incomplete removal of diclofenac, the compound that was found in the highest abundance, was observed via biodegradation and adsorption, and that UV photolysis was the main removal mechanism for this compound. The effect of adsorption to the secondary sludge was often negligible for the PhACs, with the exceptions of diclofenac, etofenamate, hydroxyzine and indapamide. However, the musks showed a high level of adsorption to the sludge. UV radiation had an important role in reducing the concentration of some of the target compounds (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen, clorazepate, indapamide, enalapril and atenolol) not removed in the activated sludge tank.
   The main removal mechanism of PhACs and musks studied in the WWTP was most often biological (45%), followed by adsorption (33%) and by UV radiation (22%). In the majority of the cases, the WWTP achieved > 75% removal of the most detected PhACs and musks, with the exception of diclofenac.

AB Over 1.5 years continuous piloting of a municipal wastewater plant upgraded with a double membrane system (ca. 0.6 m(3) d(-1) of product water produced) have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving high water quality with a water yield of 90% by combining a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a submerged ultrafiltration membrane followed by a reverse osmosis membrane (RO). The novelty of the proposed treatment scheme consists of the appropriate conditioning of MBR effluent prior to the RO and in recycling the RO concentrates back to the biological unit.
   All the 15 pharmaceuticals measured in the influent municipal sewage were retained below 100 ng L-1, a proposed quality parameter, and mostly below detection limits of 10 ng L-1. The mass balance of the micropollutants shows that these are either degraded or discharged with the excess concentrate, while only minor quantities were found in the excess sludge. The micropollutant load in the concentrate can be significantly reduced by ozonation. A low treated water salinity (< 10 mM inorganic salts; 280 +/- 70 mu S cm(-1)) also confirms that the resulting product has a high water quality.
   Solids precipitation and inorganic scaling are effectively mitigated by lowering the pH in the RO feed water with CO2 conditioning, while the concentrate from the RO is recycled to the biological unit where CO2 is stripped by aeration. This causes precipitation to occur in the bioreactor bulk, where it is much less of a process issue. SiO2 is the sole exception. Equilibrium modeling of precipitation reactions confirms the effectiveness of this scaling-mitigation approach for CaCO3 precipitation, calcium phosphate and sulfate minerals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, there has been an increase in studies regarding nanofiltration-based processes for removing antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds from water and wastewater. In this work, a 2(k)factorial design with five control factors (antibiotic molecular weight and concentration, nanofiltration (NF) membrane, feed flow rate, and transmembrane pressure) was employed to optimize the NF performance on the treatment of antibiotic-containing wastewater. The resulting multiple linear regression model was used to predict the antibiotic rejections and permeate fluxes. Additional experiments, using the same membranes and the same antibiotics, but under different conditions of transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and antibiotic concentration regarding the 2(k)factorial design were carried out to validate the model developed. The model was also evaluated as a tertiary treatment of urban wastewater for removing sulfamethoxazole and norfloxacin. Considering all the conditions investigated, the tightest membrane (NF97) showed higher antibiotics rejection (>97%) and lower permeate fluxes. On the contrary, the loose NF270 membrane presented lower rejections to sulfamethoxazole, the smallest antibiotic, varying from 65% to 97%, and permeate fluxes that were about three-fold higher than the NF97 membrane. The good agreement between predicted and experimental values (R-2> 0.97) makes the model developed in the present work a tool to predict the NF performance when treating antibiotic-containing wastewater.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the aquatic environment has been recognized as one of the emerging issues in environmental chemistry. In some investigations carried out in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, England, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the U.S., more than 80 compounds, pharmaceuticals and several drug metabolites, have been detected in the aquatic environment, Several PhACs From various prescription classes have been found at concentrations up to the mug/l-level in sewage influent and effluent samples and also in several surface waters located downstream from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). The studies show that some PhACs originating from human therapy are not eliminated completely in the municipal STPs and are, thus, discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. Under recharge conditions, polar PhACs Such as clofibric acid, carbamazepine, primidone or iodinated contrast agents can leach through the subsoil and have also been detected in several groundwater samples in Germany. Positive findings of PhACs have, however, also been reported in groundwater contaminated by landfill leachates or manufacturing residues. To date, only in a few cases PhACs have also been detected at trace-levels in drinking water samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alternative approaches to wastewater management including urine source separation have the potential to simultaneously improve multiple aspects of wastewater treatment, including reduced use of potable water for waste conveyance and improved contaminant removal, especially nutrients. In order to pursue such radical changes, system-level evaluations of urine source separation in community contexts are required. The focus of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is managing nutrients from urine produced in a residential setting with urine source separation and struvite precipitation, as compared with a centralized wastewater treatment approach. The life cycle impacts evaluated in this study pertain to construction of the urine source separation system and operation of drinking water treatment, decentralized urine treatment, and centralized wastewater treatment. System boundaries include fertilizer offsets resulting from the production of urine based struvite fertilizer. As calculated by the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), urine source separation with MgO addition for subsequent struvite precipitation with high P recovery (Scenario B) has the smallest environmental cost relative to existing centralized wastewater treatment (Scenario A) and urine source separation with MgO and Na3PO4 addition for subsequent struvite precipitation with concurrent high P and N recovery (Scenario C). Preliminary economic evaluations show that the three urine management scenarios are relatively equal on a monetary basis (<13% difference). The impacts of each urine management scenario are most sensitive to the assumed urine composition, the selected urine storage time, and the assumed electricity required to treat influent urine and toilet water used to convey urine at the centralized wastewater treatment plant. The importance of full nutrient recovery from urine in combination with the substantial chemical inputs required for N recovery via struvite precipitation indicate the need for alternative methods of N recovery.

AB Highly hydrophobic Di 2-ethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most prevalent plasticizers in wastewaters. Since its half-life in biological treatment is around 25 days, it can be used as an efficiency indicator of wastewater treatment plant for the removal of hydrophobic emerging contaminants. In this study, the performance of submerged membrane bioreactor was monitored to understand the effect of DEHP on the growth of aerobic microorganisms. The data showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia concentration were detected below 10 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively for operating conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 4 and 6 hr, sludge retention time (SRT) = 140 day and sludge concentration between 11.5 and 15.8 g volatile solid (VS)/L. The removal efficiency of DEHP under these conditions was higher and ranged between 91% and 98%. Results also showed that the removal efficiency of DEHP in biological treatment depended on the concentration of sludge, as adsorption is the main mechanism of its removal. For the submerged membrane bioreactor, the pore size is the pivotal factor for DEHP removal, since it determines the amount of soluble microbial products coming out of the process. Highly assimilated microorganisms increase the biodegradation rate, as 74% of inlet DEHP was biodegraded; however, the concentration of DEHP inside sludge was beyond the discharge limit. Understanding the fate of DEHP in membrane bioreactor, which is one of the most promising and futuristic treatment process could provide replacement for conventional processes to satisfy the future stricter regulations on emerging contaminants.

AB There is a lack of data on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in estuaries worldwide, with little understanding of their temporal and spatial variations globally. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, diclofenac, trimethoprim and citalopram were measured in twelve estuaries in the UK. Initially, these compounds were monitored in the Humber Estuary, where samples were taken every two months over a twelve month period in order to assess their spatial and temporal variations. Ibuprofen was found at some of the highest concentrations ever measured in an estuary globally (18-6297 ng l(-1)), with paracetamol also measured at relatively high concentrations (4-917 ng l(-1)) in comparison to the other compounds. In terms of spatial distribution, a pattern was observed where the highest concentrations were found at a site at which wastewater is discharged, whilst compound concentrations were often lower upstream and downstream of this site. The downstream profile of pharmaceuticals differed temporally with concentrations highest downstream when input from wastewater effluent was highest. Eleven further estuaries were sampled around the UK in order to put the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the Humber Estuary into a wider context. Pharmaceutical concentrations in the other estuaries sampled were <210 ng l(-1) but, again, ibuprofen and paracetamol were found at concentrations higher than other compounds, whereas diclofenac and citalopram were absent in many estuaries. The Humber, which is the receiving environment for the sewage effluent of approximately 20% (13.6 million people) of the population of England, was observed to have the highest overall concentration of pharmaceuticals in contrast to the other estuaries sampled, thereby representing a worst case scenario for pharmaceutical pollution.

AB The increased use of synthetic textiles in the last decades, coupled with recent emphasis on the accumulation of (micro)plastic across multiple environmental compartments, has garnered interest into how microplastic fibers are released into the environment. In particular, polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis, including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement, has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies. In this study, we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic (In) fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension, as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total In content in the fibers was measured to be 0.2 % by weight, which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies (e.g. density, etc.) but provided sensitive detection limits by ICP-MS. Fiber length was 510 mu m +/- 410 mu m and 30 mu m in diameter. The incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge, with < 0.1 % In leaching over two months. In batch experiments, the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge ( > 99.9 %), with a mass balance of > 95 % recovery achieved on average across batches. Fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min, suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport.

AB The potential for integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) processes to achieve enhanced transformation of pharmaceuticals relative to conventional activated sludge (CAS) processes was assessed. Previous studies have focused on direct comparisons of parallel reactors with and without fixed film carriers and little information is available on the impacts of how varying operating parameters impact the differences in observed pharmaceutical compound (PC) transformation capabilities between CAS reactors and those equipped with both an activated sludge (AS) and fixed film carriers. The testing was carried out using bench scale sequencing batch reactors fed with authentic municipal wastewater and operated at selected combinations of temperature and solids retention time (SRT). PC transformation efficiencies were assessed in a 22 factorial design that employed the IFAS and CAS processes, operated in parallel under identical process conditions. Nitrification rate testing that was conducted to obtain insight into the biomass activity demonstrated that IFAS consistently had improved nitrification kinetics despite lower mixed liquor volatile suspended solids levels thereby demonstrating the contribution of the biofilm to nitrification. Increased transformation of atenolol (ATEN; ranging from 10-60%) and trimethoprim (TRIM; ranging from 30-50%) in the IFAS equipped reactors relative to their respective activated sludge (AS) controls was observed under all experimental conditions. Negligible transformation of carbamazepine was observed in both reactors under all conditions investigated. More than 99% of acetaminophen was transformed in both configurations under all conditions. There was no correspondence between nitrification activity and TRIM removal in the control AS while conditions that stimulated nitrification in the control AS also resulted in enhanced removal of ATEN. The results of this study indicate that the integration of biofilms in AS processes enhances transformation of some PCs.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is nowadays a well-established issue that has become a matter of both scientific and public concern. Tons of different classes of pharmaceuticals find their way to the environment at variable degrees, after their use and excretion through wastewater and sewage treatment systems. The main goal of this study was to correlate the dynamics and the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals with different temporal and hydrological patterns, at the Guadiana Basin (South of Portugal). Water samples were collected bimonthly during 2017 (classified as a drought year) and 2018 (post-drought year) in: Zebro, Alamos and Amieira (intermittent hydrological streams), and Lucefecit (perennial hydrological stream). The pharmaceuticals quantified in higher concentrations, out of 27 investigated, were diclofenac (up to 4806 ng L-1), ibuprofen (3161 ng L-1), hydrochlorothiazide (2726 ng L-1) and carbamazepine (3223 ng L-1). Zebro and Alamos presented the highest contamination by this group of environmental hazardous substances, which may be correlated with the presence of wastewater treatment plants upstream the sampling point of each stream. Furthermore, the highest concentrations occurred mainly during the dry period (2017), when the flow was nearly inexistent in Zebro, and in Alamos after the first heavy rainfalls. In specific periods, the high concentrations of pharmaceuticals detectedmay induce risk for the organisms of lowest trophic levels, damaging the balance of the ecosystems at these streams. The risk quotient optimised approach (RQf) integrating exposure, toxicity and persistence factors, ranks the pharmaceuticals investigated in terms of risk for the aquatic ecosystems as follows: diclofenac, ibuprofen and carbamazepine (high risk), clarithromycin (moderate risk), acetaminophen, ofloxacin and bezafibrate (endurable risk), and hydrochlorothiazide (negligible risk).

AB Antioxidants (melanoidins and polyphenols) present in sugarcane molasses distillery wastewater are not readily biodegradable. However, these compounds exhibit potential physiological properties which may be tapped for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Recovery of these compounds from distillery wastewater could thus lead to products of commercial interest while improving the conventional biological (anaerobic) treatment step. Three processes viz. ultrafiltration (UF), adsorption-desorption and solvent extraction were investigated for antioxidants recovery from distillery wastewater and selected fractions were subjected to biomethanation (anaerobic digestion). The effect of different adsorbents and solvents as well as operational parameters on antioxidants recovery was studied and the separated fractions were analyzed for melanoidins content, polyphenols content and antioxidant activity. UF through 100 kDa membrane resulted in an antioxidant rich retentate (245 mM TEAC) but the permeability was low. Solvent extraction with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) led to 113 mM TEAC recovery in organic phase. Adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by desorption with acidified ethanol enabled antioxidants recovery of 192 mM TEAC. Antioxidant removal from the wastewater improves biomethanation. Overall, adsorption on XAD16 resin followed by biomethanation (74% COD reduction and 71% methane in biogas within 25 days) appears to be promising for improving the existing biomethanation facility while recovering antioxidants with potential commercial value. Further analysis of the antioxidants fraction is required to ascertain the content of specific commercially viable polyphenols.

AB The assessment of potential impacts of wastewater effluent discharges in freshwater systems requires an understanding of the likely degrees of dilution and potential zones of influence. In this study, four tracers commonly present in wastewater effluents were monitored to compare their relative effectiveness in determining areas in freshwater systems that are likely to be impacted by effluent discharges. The four tracers selected were the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine, anthropogenic gadolinium, fluorescent-dissolved organic matter (fDOM), and electrical conductivity (EC). The four tracers were monitored longitudinally in two distinct freshwater systems receiving wastewater effluents, where one site had a high level of effluent dilution (effluent < 1 % of total flow) and the other site had a low level of effluent dilution (effluent similar to 50 % of total flow). At both sites, the selected tracers exhibited a similar pattern of response intensity downstream of discharge points relative to undiluted wastewater effluent, although a number of anomalies were noted between the tracers. Both EC and fDOM are non-specific to human influences, and both had a high background response, relative to the highly sensitive carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium responses, although the ease of measuring EC and fDOM would make them more adaptable in highly variable systems. However, the greater sensitivity and selectivity of carbamazepine and gadolinium would make their combination with EC and fDOM as tracers of wastewater effluent discharges highly desirable to overcome potential limitations of individual tracers.

AB Cement is the most widely used construction material in the world. However, its manufacture is high energy consumption and high carbon emission owing to the high temperature calcination process. Geopolymer is an ideal alternative material for cement because it has a similar structure and performance to cement. In addition, it can be synthesized at room temperature and thus has the advantages of energy saving and carbon emission reduction. Sewage sludge (SS) can be used as raw material for geopolymer synthesis. However, the high organic matter content in SS lowers the mechanical strength of geopolymer. Although the organic matter in SS can be removed by incineration at high temperature, this consumes energy and emits carbon dioxide, which diminishes the advantages of geopolymer. In this study, the Fenton method was applied for the removal of organic matter in SS at room temperature. The parameters of the Fenton method, including the dosages of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Fe2+ reagent (FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), reaction time, and initial pH value, were investigated. The results indicated that 83.7% of the organic matter in SS could be removed at room temperature by using 5.15 M H2O2 and 5.15 mM FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O at pH 7, which suggested the possibility of sewage sludge reclamation through geopolymer synthesis as an alternative material for cement toward sustainability.

AB Assessment of the fate of pharmaceutical residues in the environment involves the measurement or prediction of their sewage sludge partition coefficient (K-d). Sewage sludge can be classified into four types: primary, activated, secondary and digested, each one with different physical and chemical properties. Published studies have measured K-d for pharmaceuticals in a variety of sludge types. This paper discusses the variability of reported K-d values of pharmaceuticals in different types of sewage sludge, using a dataset generated from the literature. Using a meta-analysis approach, it was shown that the measured K-d values depend on the type of sludge used in the test. Recommendations are given for the type of sludge to be used when studying the partitioning behaviour of pharmaceuticals in waste water treatment plants. Activated sludge is preferred due to its more homogenous nature and the ease of collection of consistent samples at a plant. Weak statistical relationships were found between K-d values for activated and secondary sludge, and for activated and digested sludge. Pooling of K-d values for these sludge types is not recommended for preliminary fate and risk assessments. In contrast, statistical analyses found stronger similarities between K-d values reported for the same pharmaceutical in primary and activated sludges. This allows the pooling of experimental values for these two sludge types to obtain a larger dataset for modelling purposes.

AB The inadequate removal of pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plants, as evidenced by their detection of these substances in the aquatic environment has led to the need for sustainable remediation strategies. Laccases possess a number of advantages including a broad substrate spectrum. To identify promoting or inhibitory effects of reaction partners in the remediation processes we tested not only single compounds-as has been described in most studies-but also mixtures of pollutants. The reaction of diclofenac (DCF) and flufenamic acid (FA), mediated by Trametes versicolor laccase resulted in the formation of products, which were more hydrophilic than the respective reactant (reactant concentration of 0.1 mM; laccase activity 0.5 U/ml). Analyses (HPLC, LC/MS) showed that the product 1a and 1b for DCF and FA, respectively, to be a para-benzoquinone imine derivative. The formation of 1a was enhanced by the addition of bisphenol A (BPA). After 6 days 97% more product was formed in the mixture of DCF and BPA compared with DCF tested alone. Product 1a was also detected in experiments with micropollutant-supplemented secondary effluent. Within 24 h 67% and 100% of DCF and BPA were transformed, respectively (25 U/ml). Experiments with a membrane reactor (volume 10 l; phosphate buffer, pH 7) were in good agreement with the results of the laboratory scale experiments (50 ml). EC50-values were also determined. The data support the use of laccases for the removal or detoxification of recalcitrant pollutants. Thus, the enzyme laccase may be a component of an additional environmentally friendly process for the treatment stage of wastewater remediation.

AB Illicit drugs constitute a class of emergmg contaminants that has been drawing significant concern due to its potent pharmacological and biological activities. In this study, an in situ passive sampling approach that uses diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) was successfully tested for measuring ketamine (KET), methamphetamine (METH), and amphetamine (AMP) in water. The diffusion coefficients of KET, METH, and AMP in diffusive gel were (8.13 +/- 0.12) X 10(-6), (8.55 +/- 0.14) X 10(-6), and (7.72 +/- 0.18) X 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) at 22 degrees C, respectively. The capacities of an XAD binding gel for KET, METH, and AMP were 92, 57, and 45 mu g per binding gel disc, which were suitable for long-term environmental monitoring. The DGT measurement of these drugs was not influenced by the pH (4 to 9) and the ionic strength (0.001 M - 0.1 M) and unaffected by the water flow, demonstrating the effectiveness of the XAD-based DGT for the in situ Monitoring of illicit drugs. DGT samplers were deployed in a WWTP influent and natural rivers in Beijing, China. The ng L-1 levels of the drugs were high in the wastewater influent and low in river waters, with an insignificant fluctuation during the seven-day monitoring. The DGT measured concentrations were comparable to the average concentrations determined by SPE method, which suggested that the average data measured by DGT could be substituted for high-frequency grab sampling. This study has demonstrated systematically for the first time that DGT is effective and accurate for monitoring illicit drugs in wastewater and surface waters, and provides a powerful tool to investigating the presence, transport, and environmental behaviors of these drugs in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB The frequent detection of artificial sweeteners (ASs) in wastewater and surface water gives rise to concerns about their removal, Acesulfame (ACE) and sucralose (SUC) are two ASs that are difficult to remove. The ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) advanced oxidation technology (AOT) is being considered as an effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater. However, the study of the degradation of ASs in real wastewater by the UV/PS is minimal. This study investigated the kinetics and modeling of ACE and SUC degradation in wastewater by the UV/PS process. Both ACE and SUC could be degraded effectively using this process. The degradation of ACE was mainly attributed to UV photolysis (51%), HO center dot (26%) and SO4 center dot- (16%), while that of SUC was mainly attributed to HO center dot (68%) and SO4 center dot- (27%). The second-order rate constants of ASs with SO4 center dot- were significantly lower than that with HO center dot. Three major transformation products (TPs) of ACE and four major TPs of SUC were identified. Additionally, the effects and mechanisms of the water matrices, such as HCO3-, Cl-, NO3- and natural organic matter (NOM), on ASs degradation were investigated through response surface methodology (RSM). NOM and Cl- significantly inhibited the degradation of ACE in the UV/PS system, whereas NOM and HCO3- played a main inhibition role on the degradation of SUC. A water matrices parameter model for predicting ASs degradation in real wastewater was established by RSM for the first time, and the removal of ACE and SUC was well predicted by the model.

AB On 3 October 2007, 40 participants with diverse expertise attended the workshop Tamiflu and the Environment: Implications of Use under Pandemic Conditions to assess the potential human health impact and environmental hazards associated with use of Tamiflu during an influenza pandemic. Based on the identification and risk-ranking of knowledge gaps, the consensus was that oseltamivir ethylester-phosphate (OE-P) and oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) were unlikely to pose an ecotoxicologic hazard to freshwater organisms. OC in river water might hasten the generation of OC-resistance in wildfowl, but this possibility seems less likely than the potential disruption that could be posed by OC and other pharmaceuticals to the operation of sewage treatment plants. The work-group members agreed on the following research priorities: a) available data on the ecotoxicology of OE-P and OC should be published; b) risk should be assessed for OC-contaminated river water generating OC-resistant viruses in wildfowl; c) sewage treatment plant functioning due to microbial inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors and other antimicrobials used during a pandemic should be investigated: and e realistic worst-case exposure scenarios should be developed. Additional modeling would be useful to identify localized areas within river catchments that might be prone to high pharmaceutical concentrations in sewage treatment plant effluent. Ongoing seasonal use of Tamiflu in Japan offers opportunities for researchers to assess how much OC enters and persists in the aquatic environment.

TI Removal of Berberine from Wastewater by MIL-101(Fe): Performance and
   Mechanism
SO ACS OMEGA
LA English
DT Article
AB The water contamination from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has attracted worldwide attention in recent years because of its threat to public health. Berberine is a typical anti-inflammatory medicine and berberine wastewater is difficult to be treated due to its high toxicity, poor biodegradability, and high acidity. Metal-organic frameworks would be a good choice to remove berberine from wastewater due to its advantages of high specific surface area, ultrahigh porosity, and structural and functional tunability. In this study, MIL-101(Fe) was synthesized and used for the removal of berberine from water. Experimental results indicated that MIL-101(Fe) showed promising characteristics when berberine was adsorbed in acidic wastewater. The high concentration of chloride in berberine wastewater could promote the adsorption of berberine by MIL-101(Fe). Fitting of batch equilibrium data showed that MIL-101(Fe) had a maximum adsorption capacity of 163.93 mg/g for berberine removal at pH 7, and the berberine sorption on MIL-101(Fe) followed the pseudo-second-order model. Furthermore, the associate mechanism for berberine removal was proposed by characterizing the material and theoretical calculation. The X-ray power diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that no chemical reaction occurred during the adsorption of berberine by MIL-101(Fe). Also, the theoretical calculation results indicated that pi-pi interactions may play the main role in the adsorption of berberine onto MIL-101(Fe). The findings of this study suggest that MIL-101(Fe) is a promising sorbent for berberine removal from wastewater.

AB Anthropogenic substances are a major concern due to their potential harmful effects towards aquatic ecosystems. Because wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to remove these substances from wastewater, a part of the anthropogenic substances enter nature via WWTP discharges. During the spring 2019, the occurrence of anthropogenic substances in the municipal wastewater effluent in Kuopio, Finland, was analysed. Furthermore, the capacity of selected disinfection methods to reduce these substances from wastewater was tested. The disinfection methods were ozonation (760 mL min(-1)) with an OxTube hermetic dissolution method (1), the combined usage of peracetic acid (PAA) (<5 mg L-1) and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection (12 mJ/cm(2)) (2), and the combined usage of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (<10 mg L-1) and UV disinfection (12 mJ/cm(2)) (3). The substances found at the concentrations over 1 mu g L-1 in effluent (N = 3) were cetirizine (5.2 +/- 1.3 mu g L-1), benzotriazole (BZT) (2.1 +/- 0.98 mu g L-1), hydrochlorothiazide (1.7 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1), furosemide (1.6 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1), lamotrigine (1.5 +/- 0.06 mu g L-1), diclofenac (DCF) (1.4 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1), venlafaxine (1.0 +/- 0.13 mu g L-1) and losartan (0.9 +/- 0.2 mu g L-1). The reduction (%) with different methods (1, 2, 3) were: cetirizine (99.9, 5.0, NR = no removal), benzotriazole (67.9, NR, NR), hydrochlorothiazide (91.1, 5.9, NR), furosemide (99.7, 5.9, NR), lamotrigine (46.4, NR, 6.7), diclofenac (99.7, 7.1, 16.7), venlafaxine (91.3, NR, 1.1), losartan (99.6, 13.8, NR). Further research concerning the tested disinfection methods is needed in order to fully elucidate their potential for removing anthropogenic substances from purified wastewater.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a multifunctional environmental technology capable of supporting plant and wildlife communities and removing excess nutrients and other pollutants. Tertiary treatment wetlands have also been proposed as one solution to remove persistent pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that remain after conventional wastewater treatment. Though aquatic wildlife is generally sensitive to environmental contaminants, it is unknown whether CWs can serve dual purposes supporting wildlife habitat and polishing wastewater. Our objective was to assess the capacity of a newly established CW for tertiary wastewater treatment to support amphibians. Specifically, we assessed adult anuran occupancy and tadpole and adult body size and condition relative to nearby unimpacted ponds. We found that a diverse community of adult anurans rapidly colonized the wetlands where successful reproduction was documented. Adult frogs and tadpoles were observed to have variable sizes among ponds with some life stages in better body condition at the tertiary treatment wetlands. Preliminary investigations suggest that tertiary treatment wetlands provide habitat for successful colonization and reproduction of anurans, but carryover effects need to be evaluated to determine if tertiary treatment wetlands serve as sinks or suitable habitat that supports stable populations.

AB A pharmaceutical wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (GOD) concentration of 40,000 mg/l and a sulfate concentration of 5,000 mg/l was treated in a anaerobic baffled reactor. Treatment of the wastewater at 10% dilution was effective but at higher influent concentrations sulfide inhibition reduced efficacy of both COD conversion and sulfate conversion. A racycle line with an attached-film biological reactor was inserted into the anaerobic baffled reactor to facilitate biological sulfide oxidation. Recycling anaerobic effluent through a sulfide oxidizing biological system reduced inhibition in the anaerobic reactor by both reducing inhibitory sulfide concentrations within the reactor and by diluting the influent. The major product of the biological oxidation of sulfide by a Thiobacillus species appeared to be elemental sulfur. At an influent wastewater concentration of 40% and a HRT of 1 day, COD removal efficiencies were greater than 50% and the conversion of influent sulfate was greater than 95% with affluent sulfide concentrations of lass than 20 mg/l. The major product observed from degradation of isopropyl acetate was acetic acid. Coupled anaerobic/aerobic provided removal of sulfur from the wastewater stream and helped to stabilize the pH in the reactor system. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB The relevance of endocrine-disrupting compounds as potential contaminants of drinking water is reviewed, particularly in the reuse of wastewater. Growing populations and increasing intensification of land and water use for industry and agriculture have increased the need to reclaim wastewater for reuse, including to supplement the drinking water supply. The variety of anthropogenic chemicals that have been identified as potential endocrine disruptors in the environment and the problems arising from their use as human and livestock pharmaceuticals, as agricultural chemicals and in industry are discussed. The potentially adverse impact of these chemicals on human health and the ecology of the natural environment are reviewed. Data for the removal of estrogenic compounds from wastewater treatment are presented, together with the comparative potencies of estrogenic compounds. The relative exposure to estrogens of women on oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and through food consumption is estimated. A brief overview of some methods available or under development for the assessment of estrogenic activity in environmental samples is provided. The review concludes with a discussion of the directions for further investigation, which include human epidemiology, methodology development, and wastewater monitoring.

AB Due to their pervasive applications, phthalic acid esters or phthalates have ample presence in all environmental compartments. A principal source of their existence in freshwater is phthalate-laden wastewater treatment plant effluents. For its sustainable operation and biogas production, wastewater treatment scheme of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and polishing pond is more prevalent in developing countries. This yearlong study focused on evaluating the occurrence, fate and risk of four priority phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in a UASB+ polishing pond-based wastewater treatment plant. Concentration of the phthalates in raw wastewater ranged from nd to 17.36 mu g/L (DEP), 0.92 to 18.26 mu g/L (DBP), nd to 6.54 mu g/L (BBP), and nd to 53.21 mu g/L (DEHP). DEHP concentrations in UASB sludge were below 100 mg/kg, the recommended limit by the European Union for safe disposal of dewatered sludge. All four compounds were removed approximately 80% in the wastewater treatment plant, with larger removal in polishing pond than UASB. Sorption contributes a significant portion of BBP and DEHP removal (15-24%) in UASB than DEP and DBP (0-3%). Seasonally, larger removals of phthalates were observed during the summer season. Risk assessment showed that the treated effluents had low risk of DEP, DBP, and BBP. However, the hazard quotient (HQ) of DEHP was greater than 1. To comply with regulations, dilution requirement of effluents was investigated which showed that a dilution factor of 4.4 in summer and 2.1 in winter is required for effluents of UASB + Pond-based treatment plant.

AB The marine-estuarine polychaete Capitella is an indicator of organic pollution and plays important roles in sewage waste cycling. The antidepressant fluoxetine can be accumulated in streams and sewage effluents and it could pose a hazard to infauna. Effects of fluoxetine on feeding and growth of Capitella teleta were investigated through the exposure to 0, 0.001, 0.03, 0.3 and 33 mu g/g dry weight sediment-spiked fluoxetine during 18 days. No effects of fluoxetine concentrations were observed on egestion rates, body weight and size-specific egestion rates. Fluoxetine favoured the occurrence of males with abnormal genital spines. This suggests that fluoxetine can have important reproductive implications. Further studies are recommended to assess potential detrimental effects on benthic infauna inhabiting close to sewage treatment plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, two conventional (with and without sand filter) and four additional (moving bed biofilm reactor, ozone, moving bed biofilm reactor combined with ozone and a membrane bio reactor) treatment technologies were operated in small-scale at Hammarby Sjostad sewage treatment plant, Stockholm, Sweden. The effluents were tested with five short-term ( <= 7 days exposure) ecotoxicological tests, and analyzed for a number of target analytes, comprising pharmaceuticals, natural hormones and industrial chemicals. Overall, the tested effluents generated few adverse effects at lower concentrations ( < 50% sewage effluent), and no major differences were observed between any of the treatments. The effluent treated with the moving bed biofilm reactor resulted in the lowest effects in the ecotoxicological tests. The most efficient treatment technology with regard to the pharmaceutical residues was the ozone treatment, which however caused negative effects in some of the ecotoxicological tests.

AB It is known that many kinds of fermentative antibiotics can be removed by temperature enhanced hydrolysis from production wastewater based on their easy -to -hydrolyze characteristics. However, a few aminoglycosides are hard to hydrolyze below 100 degrees C because of their stability expressed by high molecular energy gap (triangle E). Herein, removal of hard -to -hydrolyze kanamycin residue from production wastewater by hydrothermal treatment at subcritical temperatures was investigated. The results showed the reaction temperature had a significant impact on kanamycin degradation. The degradation half-life (tv2) was shortened by 87.17 -fold when the hydrothermal treatment temperature was increased from 100 degrees C to 180 degrees C. The t(1/2) of kanamycin in the N2 process was extended by 1.08 -1.34-fold compared to that of the corresponding air process at reaction temperatures of 140-180 degrees C, indicating that the reactions during hydrothermal treatment process mainly include oxidation and hydrolysis. However, the contribution of hydrolysis was calculated as 75%-98%, which showed hydrolysis played a major role during the process, providing possibilities for the removal of kanamycin from production wastewaters with high -concentration organic matrices. Five transformation products with lower antibacterial activity than kanamycin were identified using UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. More importantly, hydrothermal treatment could remove 97.9% of antibacterial activity (kanamycin EQ 1,109 mg/L) from actual production wastewater with CODcr around 100,000 mg/L. Furthermore, the methane production yield in anaerobic inhibition tests could be increased about 2.3 times by adopting the hydrothermal pretreatment. Therefore, it is concluded that hydrothermal treatment as a pretreatment technology is an efficient method for removing high -concentration hard -to -hydrolyze antibiotic residues from wastewater with high -concentration organic matrices.

AB The synthesis of steroid hormones produces wastewater that is difficult to manage and characterize due to its complex components and high levels of toxicity and bio-refractory compounds. In this work, interior micro-electrolysis (IME) and Fenton oxidation coagulation (FOC) were investigated as wastewater pretreatment processes in combination with biological treatments using a hydrolysis acidification unit (HA) and two-stage biological contact oxidation (BCO) in laboratory and field experiments. In laboratory experiments with an average initial COD load of about 15,000 mg/L, pH of 4, Fe-C/water (V/V) ratio of 1:1, air/water ratio of 10, and reaction time of 180 min, IME achieved a COD removal efficiency of 31.8% and a 1.7-fold increase in the BOD5/COD (B/C) ratio of wastewater. The Fe2+ concentration of 458.5 mg/L in the IME effluent meets the requirements of the Fenton oxidation (FO) process. FOC further reduced the COD with an efficiency of 30.1%, and the B/C ratio of the wastewater reached 0.59. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis showed that complex higher molecular weight organic compounds in the wastewater were degraded after the pretreatment process. In addition, a field experiment with a continuous flow of 96 m(3)/d was conducted for over 90 d. The combined process system operated steadily, though the Fe-C fillings should be soaked in a sulfuric acid solution (5 parts per thousand) for 12 h to recover activity every two weeks. The COD and BOD5 concentrations in the final effluent were less than 90 mg/L and 15 mg/L, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of four recalcitrant and toxic VOCs (volatile organic compounds) present in pharmaceutical wastewater was studied using a continuous flow plasma reactor, along with evaluating its potential for real effluent treatment. The wastewater was sprayed into the plasma zone of the reactor, and it was re-circulated for better performance. The effect of different HRTs (hydraulic retention time) and initial concentrations of VOCs on the degradation efficiency were evaluated. In continuous reactor, complete removal of 200 mg/L of chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene was achieved at a HRT of 33.3 min, with an energy consumption of 22.4 kWh/m3. The study on the effect of different inlet loading rates of VOCs on elimination capacity showed that, the removal was limited initially by diffusion of reactive species and at higher loads, it was limited by insufficient amount of reactive species produced. During degradation of VOC mixture, more than 90% removal of chloroform, chlorobenzene and toluene was achieved at HRT of 33.3 min, and the TOC removal was 78.3%. The degradation efficiency of VOC mixture reduced slightly compared to that of individual compounds, due to insufficient amount of reactive species produced. The COD and BOD removal achieved after 140 min of direct plasma treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater in batch reactor was 92.7% and 95.2%, respectively. Coagulation pre-treatment did not have a significant effect on the plasma treatment of real wastewater. When pharmaceutical effluent treatment was carried out in continuous flow reactor, 91.8% COD removal, 90.9% BOD removal and more than 90% degradation of all VOCs were achieved at a HRT of 150 min. Plasma treatment alone was capable of effectively treating the real pharmaceutical wastewater without any pre-treatment.

AB With increasing antibiotic use, more antibiotics are being discharged into wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to effectively remove emerging pollutants. A fate model based on a Monte Carlo simulation was established by combining secondary and tertiary treatment processes to investigate the fate of six types of antibiotics during various treatment processes. The results showed that the distribution of the antibiotic concentrations in wastewater influent was strongly dependent on antibiotic type. During the secondary and tertiary wastewater processes, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed higher average removals (71.5 +/- 3.8% and 78.4 +/- 6.9%) during secondary treatment than the other four types of antibiotics. The total antibiotic removal efficiencies depended mainly on the tertiary process, with average removals of 97.9% by reverse osmosis, 93.0% by ozone oxidation, and 84.2% by powder activated carbon adsorption when combined with conventional sludge-based wastewater treatment. Reverse osmosis showed high removal efficiencies for all six antibiotics, with no particular selectivity. Ozone treatment showed significant negative correlations between antibiotics removal and molecular weight (r: -0.965, p = 0.002), Log octanol-water partition coefficient (r: -0.921, p = 0.009), and acid dissociation constant (r: -0.847, p = 0.033). After the reverse osmosis-based combination treatment, all antibiotics had risk quotients <1, indicated that reverse osmosis could significantly reduce the toxicity of antibiotics to the environment. After ozone- and powder activated carbon-based combination treatments, the remaining erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in effluent still had risk quotients >1. These results can be used to support the optimization of combined treatment of wastewater and risk assessments of antibiotics in the environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment is not sufficient for the removal of hygienically relevant bacteria and achieves only limited reductions. This study focuses on the reduction efficiencies of two semi-industrial ultrafiltration units operating at a large scale municipal wastewater treatment plant. In total, 7 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, together with 3 taxonomic gene markers targeting specific facultative pathogenic bacteria were analysed via qPCR analyses before and after advanced treatment. In parallel with membrane technologies, an ozone treatment (1 g ozone/g DOC) was performed for comparison of the different reduction efficiencies. Both ultrafiltration units showed increased reduction efficiencies for facultative pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes of up to 6 log units, resulting mostly in a strong reduction of the bacterial targets. In comparison, the ozone treatment showed some reduction efficiency, but was less effective compared with ultrafiltration due to low ozone dosages frequently used for micro-pollutant removal at municipal wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, metagenome analyses demonstrated the accumulation of facultative pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factor genes, and metabolic gene targets in the back flush retentate of the membranes, which opens further questions about retentate fluid material handling at urban wastewater treatment plants.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the degradation of sulfonamides (SNs) in real wastewater samples using photocatalytic processes performed in the presence of a commercial TiO2 catalyst (Degussa Aeroxide P25), FeCl3 and a TiO2/FeCl3 mixture. The dynamics of the photodegradation of a mixture containing sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole in distilled water and in synthetic, municipal (raw and after treatment) wastewater, in wastewater from septic tank and in landfill leachate were compared during the study. The changes in the antimicrobial activity of the samples containing SNs and the photodegradation products were also assessed using the MARA (R) test.
   It was observed that the photocatalytic degradation rate of SNs was primarily dependent on the environmental pollution degree, the catalytic system composition and pH values. In a landfill leachate the SNs photodegradation practically did not proceed. The inhibitors of the process were primarily soluble wastewater components.
   The decomposition products of the SNs did not cause an increase in the antimicrobial activity of the reaction medium. The highest effectiveness for the photodegradation of SNs was obtained using the mixture containing TiO2 (similar to 0.5 g l(-1)) and FeCl3 (similar to 0.5 mmol l(-1)) at pH similar to 3.0. The activity of this catalyst system estimated based on the half-life values of the SNs in the investigated samples were approximately 4.5 times greater than that in the presence of TiO2 alone. Its high activity at pH similar to 3 primarily resulted from the decrease in the dissociation degree of other wastewater components in acidic medium, rather than the synergism of both photocatalyst components.

AB Activated sludge reactor is commonly employed for the secondary treatment of industrial wastewater, showing a high purification yield, operating simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, industrial wastewater generally contain numerous organic and inorganic compounds which are not biodegradable; heavy metals are often found in effluents from electroplating and metal-processing industries, manufacturing of paints, plastics, scientific instruments, salts are found in wastewater from production of pesticides, pharmaceutical and food industry, waste-dump percolating water. Primary treatments are often designed to reduce heavy metal and salt contents in wastewater, nevertheless trace concentrations persist and may reach the biological reactor, resulting in biomass inhibition and dramatic loss in purification efficiency. Respirometry through Oxygen Uptake Rate measurement is one of the most rapid and reliable methods to assess the inhibition of activated sludge. In previous studies toxicity tests for specific compounds have been performed following different procedures and attaining heterogeneous results. In this work a simple modification of the configuration is proposed, in order to assess in real time the toxicity and the inhibiting effect of the incoming wastewater before it reaches the reactor. A sample is drawn from the influent and a respirometric test is performed on mixed liquor collected from the reactor itself. If the inhibition exceeds the limit, the influent is sent to storage and to an alternative treatment. Preliminary experiments were carried out with bench-scale CSTR, supplied with synthetic wastewater. Copper sulphate and sodium chloride were chosen as inhibiting compounds, supplied separately to batch samples of activated sludge in shock load at different concentrations. Copper concentration in the mixed liquor was measured by atomic absorption and salt concentration was determined through conductance measures. Inhibition up to 90% was evaluated by OUR test with short response time, demonstrating the suitability of this tool to a real time toxicity bioassay for activated sludge reactor.

AB Effluents from on-site wastewater treatment systems can influence surface water quality, particularly when infrastructure is aging, malfunctioning, and improperly installed. Municipal wastewater often contains chemical compounds that can lead to adverse biological effects, such as reproductive impairment, in organisms that are chronically exposed. A significant number of these compounds are endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Water quality influences of on-site systems are poorly studied in semi-arid regions where instream flows are seasonally dependent on snowmelt, and when instream dilution of wastewater effluents is minimal during other times of the year. Here we examined surface water estrogenicity in low order tributaries of two unique semi-arid streams with on-site wastewater treatment systems, for which seasonal instream flow fluctuations occur in Park City, UT, USA. Water samples were collected from a total of five locations along two lotic systems downstream from active on-site treatment systems. Samples were extracted for targeted chemical analyses and to perform in vivo and in vitro bioassays with juvenile rainbow trout. Estrogenic activity was measured by quantifying the concentration and expression of vitellogenin (VTG) in plasma and liver, respectively. Plasma VTG presented elevated levels in fish exposed to water samples collected at the two sites in close proximity to on-site systems and during seasons with low stream discharge, though the levels observed did not suggest severe endocrine disruption. However, long-term exposure to these surface water could compromise the fish populations. While the sensitivity of in vitro bioassays was low and targeted chemical analyses did not identify causative compounds, the use of complementary lines of evidence (e.g., in vivo biological models) was advantageous in identifying estrogenic activity in waters influenced by effluents from on-site wastewater systems.

AB Averaged 7-day composite effluent wastewater samples from twelve wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in nine countries (Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Czechia, Austria, Germany) in the Danube River Basin were collected. WWTPs' selection was based on countries' dominant technology and a number of served population with the aim to get a representative holistic view of the pollution status. Samples were analyzed for 2248 chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) by wide-scope target screening employing LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. 280 compounds were detected at least in one sample and quantified. Spatial differences in the concentrations and distribution of the compounds classes were discussed. Additionally, samples were analyzed for the possible agonistic/antagonistic potencies using a panel of in vitro transactivation reporter gene CALUX (R) bioassays including ER alpha (estrogenics), anti-AR (anti-androgens), GR (glucocorticoids), anti-PR (anti-progestins), PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferators) and PAH assays. The potency of the wastewater samples to cause oxidative stress and induce xenobiotic metabolism was determined using the Nrf2 and PXR CALUX (R) bioassays, respectively. The signals from each of the bioassays were compared with the recently developed effect-based trigger values (EBTs) and thus allowed for allocating the wastewater effluents into four categories based on their measured toxicity, proposing a putative action plan for wastewater operators. Moreover, samples were analyzed for antibiotics and 13 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile genetic element (intl1) with the aim to assess the potential for antibiotic resistance. All data collected from these various types of analysis were stored in an on-line database and can be viewed via interactive map at https://norman-data.eu/EWW_DANUBE.

AB Pharmaceuticals raise concerns for aquatic species owing to their biological activities. It is estimated that nearly 40% of marketed pharmaceuticals target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using an in vitro transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) shedding assay, we previously detected antagonistic activities of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), acetylcholine (Ml), adrenergic family members (beta 1), and histamine (H1) receptors at up to mu g-antagonistequivalent quantities/L in wastewater in England and Japan. However, which pharmaceuticals were responsible for biological activities in wastewater remained unclear. Here, we used (1) the consumption of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals, particularly antagonists, as calculated from prescriptions, (2) their urinary excretion, and (3) their potency measured by the TGF alpha shedding assay to prioritize them for analysis in wastewater in England and Japan. We calculated predicted activities of 48 GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals in influents in England and Japan and identified which were mainly responsible for antagonistic activities in wastewater against each GPCR Mixtures of pharmaceuticals tested in this study were confirmed to behave additively. The combination of consumption and potency is useful in prioritizing pharmaceuticals for environmental monitoring and toxicity testing.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are thought to be potential incubators of antibiotic resistance. Persistence of commonly used antibiotics in wastewater may increase the potential for selection of resistance genes transferred between bacterial populations, some of which might pose a threat to human health. In this study, we measured the concentrations of ten antibiotics in wastewater plant influents and effluents, and in surface waters up- and downstream from two Charlotte area treatment facilities. We performed Illumina shotgun sequencing to assay the microbial community and resistome compositions at each site across four time points from late winter to mid-summer of 2016. Antibiotics are present throughout wastewater treatment, and elevated concentrations of multiple antibiotics are maintained in moving stream water downstream of effluent release. While some human gut and activated sludge associated taxa are detectable downstream, these seem to attenuate with distance while the core microbial community of the stream remains fairly consistent. We observe the slight suppression of functional pathways in the downstream microbial communities, including amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid metabolism, as well as nucleotide and amino acid scavenging. Nearly all antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potentially pathogenic taxa are removed in the treatment process, though a few ARG markers are elevated downstream of effluent release. Taken together, these results represent baseline measurements that future studies can utilize to help to determine which factors control the movement of antibiotics and resistance genes through aquatic urban ecosystems before, during, and after wastewater treatment.

AB Because of the vast use of organic chemicals in modem society, almost any wastewater stream from industrial processes or households contains such compounds and disposal without proper treatment will therefore result in exposure to humans and the environment. Some of them may exhibit endocrine disrupting effects (EDCs) and they widely exist in wastewater. The current effluent standards for Urban Wastewater Treatment Plants (UWWTPs) still include the conventional parameters of BOD, COD, pH, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, total number of E. coli etc. No limits for dangerous substances such as heavy metals or xenobiotic organic compounds exist in many countries. In the framework of the Water Frame Directive (WFD), environmental quality standards including 33 priority pollutants and some other xenobiotics have been proposed by the EU. As a consequence, member states have to establish monitoring programs for a number of priority and emerging pollutants. The integrated use of conventional biological treatment with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as ozone oxidation, photocatalysis, Fenton and Photo-Fenton oxidation have been applied in order to increase the biodegradability and also the detoxification of the effluent streams. The use of AOPs seems to be favorable for reuse applications that require high quality of treated water, like for example groundwater recharge and indirect potable reuse. However, total dissolved solids (TDS) which can be increased if AOPs are applied have to be removed before reuse. This paper aims at providing an updated review on EDCs and their removal by photocatalysis (PC) and ultrasound oxidation (US) from aqueous spiked solutions and wastewater. The recently established reuse limits in Italy are evaluated according to AOPs requirements discussed in this paper.

AB This study aimed to select a high-performance cation-exchange resin (CER) and estimate its uptake of positively ionized tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), i.e., amitriptyline (AMI), imipramine (IMI), clomipramine (CLO), and desipramine (DES), which are frequently used, and detected in wastewater treatment systems. For the selection of the resin, the one-point check test of AMI in distilled water was examined using several CERs. As a result, the strong-acid polystyrene CER, Dowex 50WX4-200, was selected on the basis of its outstanding uptake of AMI. The maximum adsorption capacities of Dowex 50WX4-200 for removal of the TCAs ranged from 2.53 +/- 0.20 mmol/g to 3.76 +/- 0.12 mmol/g, which are significantly higher when compared with those of previously reported adsorbents. This is likely because the combination of electrostatic and pi-pi interactions between the TCAs and Dowex 50WX4-200 may lead to high uptakes of the TCAs. Additionally, the removal efficiency of DES as a representative of the TCAs was tested in actual wastewater system containing activated sludge and miscellaneous cations. Consequently, the removal efficiencies of the DES in distilled water, aerobic wastewater, and filtered wastewater were 95.68%, 77.99%, and 56.66%, respectively. It is interesting to note that the activated sludge could also contribute to adsorption of the DES, leading to increased removability, while the cations present in the wastewater acted as competing ions, decreasing the removal efficiency.

AB Oxytetracycline (OTC) is a widely used antibiotic that has been frequently found in the aquatic environment. The potential reactions and kinetics of OTC degradation by chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were studied in laboratory scale. The feasibility of a combined process of ClO2 oxidation and biological activated carbon (BAC) treating real OTC wastewater from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant was also investigated. Experimental results show that OTC reacts stoichiometrically with ClO2 and the highest OTC removal rate was 98.3% at pH 2 and ClO2/OTC ratio 1.5:1. The reaction between OTC and ClO2 was of second-order overall and the apparent second-order rate constants was 0.84 M-1 s(-1) at pH 2 and room temperature (24 degrees C-26 degrees C).The combined process of ClO2 pre-oxidation and BAC bio-treatment was proved to be a sustainable technology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The ClO2 pre-oxidation process could improve the biodegradability of OTC wastewater as the BOD5/COD ratio increases from 0.04 to 0.23 at 0.2 mM ClO2 oxidation of 30 min. Under the optimal conditions of ClO2 0.2 mM, hydraulic retention time 8 h and organic loading rate below 0.8 kg COD/m(3).d, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 68.1% and the effluent COD concentration was between 79.6 and 110.3 mg/L.

AB Real hospital wastewater was effectively treated by a promising technology based on degradation reaction catalyzed by Fe-0 under microwave irradiation in this work. Fe-0 powders were synthesized and characterized by different techniques, resulting in a single-phase sample with spherical particles. Optimum experimental conditions were determined by a central composite rotatable design combined with a response surface methodology, resulting in 96.8% of chemical oxygen demand reduction and 100% organic carbon removal, after applying MW power of 780 W and Fe-0 dosage of 0.36 g L-1 for 60 min. Amongst the several organic compounds identified in the wastewater sample, diclofenac and ibuprofen were present in higher concentrations; therefore, they were set as target pollutants. Both compounds were completely degraded in 35 min of reaction time. Their plausible degradation pathways were investigated and proposed. Overall, the method developed in this work effectively removed high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Measuring community consumption of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is notoriously difficult to assess by traditional means such as surveys and seizure data. Previously, we used the approach to demonstrate the prevalence of NPS on a national scale. In the current study we explored the temporal resolution for the analysis of NPS in wastewater from Australia. Samples covering all States and Territories in Australia and both metropolitan and regional areas and were collected bimonthly from October 2017-June 2018 and October 2019-February 2020. A qualitative screening method was applied, screening for 201 NPS. In total, 15 substances were found from a variety of classes of NPS. The most prevalent class was synthetic cathinones, with pentylone, N-ethylpentylone and ethylone found in all periods in at least one site in the earlier sampling period, as well as the amphetamine-like paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA). In the latter period, synthetic cathinones were also the most prevalent, including eutylone, marking the first time that this compound has been detected in wastewater. This study shows the application of wastewater analysis to detect outbreaks of NPS use and temporal differences among sites. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The literature on the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater over the period 1990-2015 has been reviewed to develop a sustainable treatment strategy. Analysis of the existing methods for treatment and disposal practices of pharmaceutical waste has been undertaken on the classification of the treatment methods under well-identified broad specific groups. The review reveals the associated merits and demerits of the traditional and the emerging methods and the challenges involved in overcoming the shortcomings. Considering the very diverse nature of the contaminants and the poor success rates of the existing technologies, it transpires that no single classical technology is capable of fully taking care of the hazards emanating from pharmaceutical waste discharges. On the other hand, some recent technologies such as membrane-integrated hybrid technologies are emerging as more successful ones than the conventional technologies. But, scale up confidence with respect to such new technologies is still very limited and needs to be substantially improved through extensive investigation on the pilot scale using real pharmaceutical wastewater rather than synthetic wastewater. This review directs the research focus to the development of sustainable treatment technologies.

AB The current study aims to investigate the production of microalgae biomass as a function for different wet market wastewater ratios (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) and Scenedesmus sp. initial concentrations (10(4), 10(5), 10(6), 10(7) cells/mL) through the phycoremediation process. The biomass production, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total organic compounds (TOC) were determined daily. The pseudo-first order kinetic model was used to measure the potential of Scendesmus sp. in removing nutrients while the Verhulst logistic kinetic model was used to study the growth kinetic. The study revealed that the maximum productivity of Scenedesmus sp. biomass was recorded with 10(6) cells/mL of the initial concentration in 50% wet market wastewater (98.54 mg/L/day), and the highest removal of TP, TN, and TOC was obtained (85, 90 and 65% respectively). Total protein and lipid contents in the biomass yield produced in the wet market wastewater were more than that in the biomass produced in the BBM (41.7 vs. 37.4 and 23.2 vs. 19.2%, respectively). The results of GC-MS confirmed detection of 44 compounds in the biomass from the wet market wastewater compared to four compounds in the BBM. These compounds have several applications in pharmaceutical and personal care products, chemical industry and antimicrobial activity. These findings indicated the applicability of wet market wastewater as a production medium for microalgae biomass.

AB A pilot-scale test was conducted with a two-phase anaerobic digestion (TPAD) system and a subsequential membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The TPAD system comprised a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket-anaerobic filter (UASBAF), working as the acidogenic and methanogenic phases, respectively. The wastewater was high in COD, varying daily between 5789 and 58,792 mg L-1, with a wide range of pH from 4.3 to 7.2. The wastewater was pumped at a fixed flow rate of 1 m(3) h(-1) through the CSTR, the UASBAF and the MBR in series, resulting in respective HRTs of 12, 55 and 5 h. Almost all the COD was removed by the TPAD-MBR system, leaving a COD of around 40 mg L-1 in the MBR effluent. The pH of the MBR effluent was found in a narrow range of 6.8-7.6, indicating that the MBR effluent can be directly discharged into natural waters. A model, built on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory and linear regression techniques, was developed for the simulation of TPAD-MBR system performance in the biodegradation of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The model well fitted the laboratory data, and was able to simulate the removal of COD. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parabens are widely used as antimicrobial and preservative in pharmaceutical and personal products. Their presence has been detected in rivers and wastewater treatment plants. Photocatalytic ozonation process using a low amount of 0.1 wt% Ag-TiO2 proved to be efficient on the degradation of a mixture of five parabens using a low transferred ozone dose (TOD). The pH effect was analyzed under acidic and neutral conditions. Also, the effect of hydroxyl radical scavenger on parabens degradation and on by-products formation was discussed. Hydroxyl radical present a significant role over parabens degradation and also on by-products formation. The reaction mechanism was analyzed using municipal wastewater as a matrix to infer about the behavior of the process at actual conditions. Municipal wastewater as a matrix clearly enhanced the parabens degradation when compared with the case where ultrapure water was used. In fact, the TOD required for total parabens degradation is lowered 10-20 mg/L of TOD. Therefore, to understand the main responsible species for this improvement, the effects of several ions naturally present in wastewater (HCO3-, Cl- and SO42-) were tested. According to the results it seems that sulfate radical improves the process, while chloride and bicarbonate radicals decrease the process efficiency. In terms of toxicity the luminescence inhibition for Vibrio fischeri was analyzed. The inhibition significantly decreased for treated spiked municipal wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine have been investigated in 101 anaerobic lab-scale digesters with continuous stirring and mesophilic conditions at 37 degrees C to investigate whether they would be reduced or accumulated in sewage sludge depending on whether the bacteria present were able to use the SSRIs as a carbon source or not. The total SSRI concentration had a significant reduction in concentration during the anaerobic treatment process from theoretically 0.58 mg/l to 0.21 mg/l after 17 days. However, large differences in the reduction of the different compounds were found. Paroxetine and citalopram were found to be almost completely reduced at day 24 with reductions of 85% (citalopram) and 98% (paroxetine). Reductions of 32% (fluoxetine), 53% (fluvoxamine) and 38% (sertraline) indicate that these three compounds have a higher potential for accumulation. None metabolites of these compounds were found in the samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption with activated carbon is widely suggested as an option for the removal of organic micro pollutants including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. In this study adsorption with granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) was analyzed and compared in parallel operation at three Swedish wastewater treatment plants with the goal to achieve a 95% PhAC removal. Initially, mapping of the prevalence of over 100 substances was performed at each plant and due to low concentrations a final 22 were selected for further evaluation. These include carbamazepine, clarithromycin and diclofenac, which currently are discussed for regulation internationally. A number of commercially available activated carbon products were initially screened using effluent wastewater. Of these, a reduced set was selected based on adsorption characteristics and cost. Experiments designed with the selected carbons in pilot-scale showed that most products could indeed remove PhACs to the target level, both on total and individual basis. In a setup using internal recirculation the PAC system achieved a 95% removal applying a fresh dose of 15-20 mg/L, while carbon usage rates for the GAC application were much broader and ranged from <28 to 230 mg/L depending on the carbon product. The performance of the PAC products generally gave better results for individual PhACs in regards to carbon availability. All carbon products showed a specific adsorption for a specific PhAC meaning that knowledge of the target pollutants must be acquired before successful design of a treatment system. In spite of different configurations and operating conditions of the different wastewater treatment plants no considerable differences regarding pharmaceutical removal were observed.

AB In the midst of increasing global production of domestic wastewater over the years, the treatment capacities did not show promising increments to keep up with it. Traditionally, biological treatment systems such as wetlands, conventional activated sludge (CAS), trickling filter processes, and rotating biological reactors were used to treat these wastewaters. The capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the process play a critical role in the final system selection. During the past decade, membrane bioreactor (MBR) has progressively replaced these biological wastewater treatment systems. For example, the most advanced form of MBRs called membrane-aerated biofilm reactors (MABRs) could be operated with higher energy efficiency of 70% compared to CAS process. Moreover, even at a low footprint, MBRs could achieve a high volume of treatment in existing area with records of up to 50% extra capacity. Following these MBR systems, the next technological innovation was membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), which uses the bubbleless aeration through the lumen of fiber membrane. The bubbleless aeration, in fact, assists the smooth growth of microorganisms compared to the bubbled aeration in CAS process which often interferes with the microbial growth in the system. Apart from providing diffused aeration, the membrane also serves as attachment medium for microorganisms that consume organics and nitrogen, thereby purifying the wastewater. Thus, within a single reactor, simultaneous nitrification and denitrification are achieved. The MABRs have been successful in the treatment of variety of pollutants such as landfill leachate, pharmaceutical wastewater, ammonia-rich wastewater, domestic wastewater, and anaerobic digestion liquor. In addition, their applications have flourished for the treatment of high carbon and nitrogen wastewater, volatile organic compounds, and xenobiotic components. However, the major limitation of this process is maintaining optimal biofilm thickness on the membrane surface and scaling-up mechanisms to real scale plants.

AB Endoxifen is the main active metabolite of a common cytostatic drug, tamoxifen. Endoxifen has been recently detected in the final effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants. The antiestrogenic activity of endoxifen could bring negative effects to aquatic life if released to the water environment. This study elucidated the fate and susceptibility of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen (2 mu g mL-1, 1:1 wt ratio between the two easily interchangeable isomers) in wastewater and receiving surface water to sunlight. Phototransformation by-products (PBPs) and their toxicity were determined. Sunlight reduced at least 83% of endoxifen concentration in wastewater samples, whereas in surface water samples, 60% of endoxifen was photodegraded after 180 min of the irradiation. In ultrapure water samples spiked with endoxifen, PBPs were mainly generated via con-rotatory 6 pi-photocyclization, followed by oxidative aromatization. These PBPs underwent secondary reactions leading to a series of PBPs with different molecular weights. Eight PBPs were identified and the toxicity analysis via the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool revealed that seven of these PBPs are more toxic than endoxifen itself. This is likely due to the formation of poly-aromatic core in the PBPs due to exposure to sunlight. Therefore, highly toxic PBPs may be generated if endoxifen is present in water and wastewater exposed to sunlight. The presence, fates and activities of these PBPs in surface water especially at locations close to treated wastewater discharge points should be investigated.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are compounds frequently found in municipal wastewater and their degradation by conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is generally incomplete. This study compared the efficiency of two advanced oxidation processes (AOP), namely heterogeneous photocatalysis (HP) and electro-Fenton (EF), in the degradation of a mixture of common NSAID (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) dissolved in either deionized water or effluent from a WWTP. Both processes were effective in degrading the NSAID mixture and the trend of degradation was as follows, diclofenac > naproxen > ibuprofen. EF with a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) and 0.3 mmol Fe2+ L-1 was the most efficient process to mineralize the organic compounds, achieving up to 92% TOC removal in deionized water and 90% in the WWTP effluent after 3 h of reaction. HP with 1.4 g TiO2 L-1 at pH 7 under sunlight, produced 85% TOC removal in deionized water and 39% in WWTP effluent also after 3 h treatment. The lower TOC removal efficiency shown by HP with the WWTP effluent was attributed mainly to the scavenging of reactive species by background organic matter in the wastewater. On the contrary, inorganic ions in the wastewater may produce oxidazing species during the EF process, which contributes to a higher degradation efficiency. EF is a promising option for the treatment of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals in municipal WWTP at competitive electrical energy efficiencies.

AB To investigate the fate of penicillin G (PEN G) in the wastewater from a PEN G production facility and the receiving river, an analytical method was developed for the simultaneous detection of PEN G and five degradation products using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS). PEN G had already undergone transformation before entering into the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), with concentrations of 153+/-4 mu g/L in raw wastewater. Most of the PEN G could be eliminated following successive treatments of anaerobic, hydrolysis, and two aerobic units under a hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 30h, and the final concentrations were 1.68+/-0.48 mu g/L in treated water. In the receiving river, the concentration of PEN G decreased from 0.31+/-0.04 mu g/L at the discharging point to under the detection limit (0.03 mu g/L) at the last sampling site (about 30km from the discharging point). The main PEN G degradation products in surface water were found to be penilloic acid, penicilloic acid and isopenillic acid, which occupied 65.8%, 20.4% and 12.9%, respectively, of the total concentration at the last site. This is the first study on the behaviors of PEN G and its main degradation products in wastewater treatment processes and the aquatic environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Approximately 40% of U.S. residents rely on groundwater as a source of drinking water. Groundwater, especially unconfined sand and gravel aquifers, is vulnerable to contamination from septic systems and infiltration of wastewater treatment plant effluent. In this study, we characterized concentrations of pharmaceuticals, perfluorosurfactants, and other organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) in the unconfined sand and gravel aquifer of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, where septic systems are prevalent. Raw water samples from 20 public drinking water supply wells on Cape Cod were tested for 92 OWCs, as well as surrogates of wastewater impact. Fifteen of 20 wells contained at least one OWC; the two most frequently-detected chemicals were sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (perfluorosurfactant). Maximum concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (113 ng/L) and the anticonvulsant phenytoin (66 ng/L) matched or exceeded maximum reported concentrations in other U.S. public drinking water sources. The sum of pharmaceutical concentrations and the number of detected chemicals were both significantly correlated with nitrate, boron, and extent of unsewered residential and commercial development within 500 m, indicating that wastewater surrogates can be useful for identifying wells most likely to contain OWCs. Septic systems appear to be the primary source of OWCs in Cape Cod groundwater, although wastewater treatment plants and other sources were potential contributors to several wells. These results show that drinking water supplies in unconfined aquifers where septic systems are prevalent may be among the most vulnerable to OWCs. The presence of mixtures of OWCs in drinking water raises human health concerns, a full evaluation of potential risks is limited by a lack of health-based guidelines and toxicity assessments.

AB The emergence of antibiotics residues in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater has been a significant environment problem. However, current methods of treating antibiotic-polluted wastewater are inefficient, of high cost and time-consuming. In this study, highly effective enzymatic Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were developed, which is extremely simple and can degrade antibiotics in a fast manner at a low cost. -Lactamase, a representative enzyme for -lactam antibiotic degradation, was covalently immobilized on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles modified with amino groups by a simple cross-linking process. The immobilized -lactamase displayed a wider pH and temperature range for penicillin G degradation than the free enzyme. Meanwhile, the thermostability and storage stability of the immobilized -lactamase were improved. Fifty milligrams magnetic nanoparticles immobilized with -lactamase can thoroughly degrade 100mL penicillin G (5-50mgL(-1)) within 5min. Even if the -lactamase immobilized on the nanoparticles was reused 35 times in the 5mgL(-1) penicillin G solution, it still kept more than 95% degradation efficiency. These suggest that magnetic nanoparticles immobilized with -lactamase have a sufficient capacity for degrading antibiotics in wastewater and will serve as a practical and economical solution to antibiotic pollution in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds such as ketoprofen, diclofenac and atenolol are frequently detected at relatively high concentrations in secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, it is important to assess their transformation kinetics and intermediates in subsequent disinfection processes, such as direct ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The photodegradation kinetics of these compounds using a medium pressure (MP) lamp was assessed in pure water, as well as in filtered and unfiltered treated wastewater. Ketoprofen had the highest time- and fluence-based rate constants in all experiments, whereas atenolol had the lowest values, which is consistent with the corresponding decadic molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield. The fluence-based rate constants of all compounds were evaluated in filtered and unfiltered wastewater matrices as well as in pure water. Furthermore, transformation products of ketoprofen, diclofenac and atenolol were identified and monitored throughout the irradiation experiments, and photodegradation pathways were proposed for each compound. This enabled the identification of persistent transformation products, which are potentially discharged from WWTP disinfection works employing UV photolysis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study concentrates on the pretreatment of real wastewater using catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO). WO3- and PO43- contained in fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater (FPW) and Cu2+ contained in berberine pharmaceutical wastewater (BPW) were studied as CWAO influent. Mixture of this two streams were reused to form Cu2+ and [PxWmOy](q-). namely polyoxometalates (POMs) as co-catalyst system to treat themselves. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the initial oxygen pressure and temperature on the COD (chemical oxygen demand), TOC (total organic carbon) removal and biodegradable enhancement, it was discovered that over 40% of COD and TOC removal can be easily realized in an hour of WAO oxidation at 523 K, 1.4 MPa. The BOD5/COD (BOD5, biochemical oxygen demand in 5 days) of this two pharmaceutical mixture ascended from nonexistent to maximum 0.41 depends on the optimal FPW:BPW volume ratio 4:1, to compose POM co-catalyst system. Organic pollutants were incompletely oxidized to propionic acid and other intermediates. Some properties (e.g., TGA, IR, XRF) of POM catalyst separated from effluent, were obtained to provide additional information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pre-oxidation of an extremely polluted pharmaceutical wastewater (chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 362,000 mg/l) using the Fenton's reagent has been systematically studied using an experimental design technique. The parameters influencing the COD removal of the wastewater, namely temperature, ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide concentrations have been optimized to achieve a COD global reduction of 56.4%.
   The total range of the proposed experimental design, however, could not be tested because under some conditions (hydrogen peroxide concentration over 5 M) the Fenton's reaction became violent and could not be controlled, probably due to the high exothermic effect associated with COD oxidation. For the tested conditions, the optimal values of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion concentration were 3 and 0.3 M, respectively, whereas temperature only showed a mild positive effect on COD removal. In addition, during the first 10 min of Fenton's reaction, more than 90% of the total COD removal can be achieved.
   Fenton's reaction has proved to be a feasible technique for the pre-oxidation of the wastewater under study, and can be considered a suitable pre-treatment for this type of wastewaters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Some refractory organic matters or soluble microbial products remained in the effluents of refractory organic wastewater after biological secondary treatment and need an advanced treatment before final disposal. Graphene oxide (GO) was known to have potential to be the next generation membrane material. The functional organics/inorganic salts separation GO membrane preparation and application in wastewater advanced treatment could reduce energy or chemicals consumption and avoid organics/inorganic salts mixed concentrate waste problems after nanofiltration or reverse osmosis. In this study, we developed a novelty GO membrane aiming at advanced purification of organic matters in the secondary effluents of refractory organic wastewater and avoiding the organics/inorganic salts mixed concentrate waste problem. The influence of preparation conditions including pore size of support membrane, the number of GO layers and the applied pressure was investigated. It was found that for organics/inorganic salts mixture separation membrane preparation, the rejection and flux would achieve balance for the support membrane at a pore size of similar to 0.1 mu m and the number of GO layers of has an optimization value (similar to 10 layers). A higher assemble pressure (similar to 10 bar) contributed to the acquisition of a higher rejection efficiency and lower roughness membrane. This as prepared GO membrane was applied to practical secondary effluent of a chemical synthesis pharmaceuticals wastewater. A good organic matter rejection efficiency (76%) and limited salt separation ( <14%) was finally obtained. These results can promote the practical application of GO membrane and the resourcelized treatment of industrial wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term irrigation with untreated wastewater can lead to an accumulation of antibiotic substances and antibiotic resistance genes in soil. However, little is known so far about effects of wastewater, applied for decades, on the abundance of IncP-1 plasmids and class 1 integrons which may contribute to the accumulation and spread of resistance genes in the environment, and their correlation with heavy metal concentrations. Therefore, a chronosequence of soils that were irrigated with wastewater from 0 to 100 years was sampled in the Mezquital Valley in Mexico in the dry season. The total community DNA was extracted and the absolute and relative abundance (relative to 16S rRNA genes) of antibiotic resistance genes (tet(W), tet(Q), aadA), class 1 integrons (intl1), quaternary ammonium compound resistance genes (qacE+qacE Delta 1) and IncP-1 plasmids (korB) were quantified by real-time PCR. Except for intll and qacE+qacE Delta 1 the abundances of selected genes were below the detection limit in non-irrigated soil. Confirming the results of a previous study, the absolute abundance of 16S rRNA genes in the samples increased significantly over time (linear regression model, p < 0.05) suggesting an increase in bacterial biomass due to repeated irrigation with wastewater. Correspondingly, all tested antibiotic resistance genes as well as intll and korB significantly increased in abundance over the period of 100 years of irrigation. In parallel, concentrations of the heavy metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr significantly increased. However, no significant positive correlations were observed between the relative abundance of selected genes and years of irrigation, indicating no enrichment in the soil bacterial community due to repeated wastewater irrigation or due to a potential co-selection by increasing concentrations of heavy metals.

AB Distribution and occurrence of Archaea and methanogenic activity in a laboratory scale, completely mixed anaerobic reactor treating pharmaceutical wastewaters were investigated and associated with reactor performance. The reactor was initially seeded with anaerobic digester sludge from an alcohol distillery wastewater treatment plant and was subjected to a three step feeding strategy. The feeding procedure involved gradual transition from a glucose containing feed to a solvent stripped pharmaceutical wastewater and then raw pharmaceutical wastewater. During the start-up period, over 90 % COD removal efficiency at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 6 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) was achieved with glucose feeding, and acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 336 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). At the end of the primary loading, when the feed contained solvent stripped pharmaceutical wastewater at full composition, 71 % soluble COD removal efficiency was obtained and acetoclastic methanogenic activity decreased to half of the rate under glucose feed (166 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1)). At the end of secondary loading with 60 % (w/v) raw pharmaceutical wastewater, COD removal dropped to zero and acetoclastic methanogenic activity fell to less than 10 ml CH4 gTVS(-1) d(-1). Throughout the course of the experiment, microbial community structure was monitored by DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Five different archaeal taxa were identified and the predominant archaeal sequences belonged to methanogenic Archaea. Two of these showed greatest sequence identity with Methanobacterium formicicum and Methanosaeta concilii. The types of Archaea present changed little in response to changing feed composition but the relative contribution of different organisms identified in the archaeal DGGE profiles did change.

AB The focus of this study was on developing a method for the effective removal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, fenoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and carbamazepine from wastewater using nanofibres from Moringa seeds protein/PVA blend. Parameters that could affect the removal of selected pharmaceuticals such as adsorbent dosage, pH, initial concentration, temperature and contact time were optimised. The optimized method was applied to real wastewater samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant. Under optimum conditions, the percentage removal was found to range from 84.5 to 97.4% for standard mixture solution and from 70.5% to 92.5 and 77.8. to 96.1% for the real wastewater (i.e. influent and effluent respectively). The adsorption data was well fitted in the Freundlich isotherm than Langmuir isotherm for all the groups of pharmaceuticals studied. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained ranged from 31.25 to 333.33 mg g(-1). The interaction between the drugs and the nanofibres predominantly occurred by chemisorption rather than by physisorption. The results obtained demonstrated that nanofibres fabricated from biomaterials could perform better than previously published materials.

AB In this study, a multistage treatment system was proposed to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic amoxicillin. Ozonation (O-3), and ozonation combined with aerobic biodegradation, were performed. The real pharmaceutical wastewater presented a high concentration of organic matter (TOC: 803 mg C.L-1 and COD: 2775 mg O-2.L-1), significant amoxicillin content (50 mg L-1) and acute ecotoxicity (Aliivibrio fischeri aTU: 48.22). Ozonation proved to be effective for amoxicillin degradation (up to 99%) and the results also indicated the removal of the original colour of the wastewater, with average consumption of 1 g of ozone. However, the ozonation system alone could not achieve complete mineralization. Therefore, a combination of ozonation and biodegradation in a multistage system was proposed in order to improve cost and treatment efficiency. The multistage treatment system presented promising results, achieving degradation of more than 99% of the amoxicillin, more than 98% of the original chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 90% of initial toxicity, with the consumption of approximately 500 mg of ozone. This indicates that this system could prevent dangerous and biorecalcitrant antibiotics from entering water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB According to the high incidence of cancer worldwide, the amount of cytostatic drugs administered to patients has increased. These compounds are excreted to wastewaters, and therefore become potential water contaminants. At this stage, very little is known on the presence and elimination of cytostatic compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The aim of this study was to develop a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS) method for the determination of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters. These compounds represent two outmost used cytostatic agents.
   Extraction and analytical conditions were optimized for cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewater. Both solid-phase extraction using Oasis 200 mg hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) cartridges and direct injection analysis were evaluated. Mass spectral characterization and fragmentation conditions were optimized at 50,000 resolving power (full width at half maximum, m/z 200) to obtain maximum sensitivity and identification performance. Quality parameters (recoveries, limits of detection, and repetitivity) of the methods developed were determined, and best performance was obtained with direct water analysis of the centrifuged wastewater. Finally, this method was applied to determine the presence of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters from a hospital effluent, an urban effluent, and influents and effluents from three WWTP.
   Cyclophosphamide and epirubicin were recovered after 50 mL preconcentration on solid-phase extraction 200 mg Oasis HLB cartridges (87% and 37%, respectively), and no breakthrough was observed by extracting 500 mL of water. Limits of detection were of 0.35 and 2.77 ng/L for cyclophosphamide and epirubicin, respectively. On the other hand, direct injection of water spiked at 1 mu g/L provided recoveries of 107% for cyclophosphamide and 44% for epirubicin and limits of detection from 3.1 to 85 ng L-1, respectively. The analysis of wastewaters using direct injection analysis revealed the presence of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in WWTP influents and hospital and urban effluents at levels ranging from 5.73 to 24.8 mu g L-1.
   The results obtained in this study demonstrate the capability of LC-Orbitrap-MS for accurate trace analysis of these very polar contaminants. This method permitted to identify cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters and influents of WWTP, but no traces were detected in WWTP effluents. The methodology herein developed is sensitive and robust and applicable for screening of a large number of samples since no preconcentration is needed.

AB Antibiotics are considered among the major pollutants in water environments. The antibiotics along with the sewage, pharmaceutical industries water waste, veterinary clinics and hospital sewages noticeably enter into the water resources and the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate ciprofloxacin removal efficiency from aqueous solutions by using cupric oxide nanoparticles. The effects of pH (3- 11), CuO nanoparticles dosage (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.1 g/L), contact time (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min) and the initial antibiotic concentration (10, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/L) were assessed on ciprofloxacin removal efficiency in laboratory. Under optimal conditions of concentration 10 mg/L, pH = 7, CuO nanoparticles dosage 0.1 g/L and contact time 60 min, the removal efficiency was 77% and q m of the CuO nanoparticles was 105 mg/g. The process of ciprofloxacin adsorption on CuO nanoparticles was depended on Freundlich adsorption isotherm more than other isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin and Harkins-Jura). On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that CuO nanoparticles adsorption process can be used as a novel method for treating wastewater contaminated with drug sources.

AB Several polar contaminants were found in screening analyses of 30 representative surface water samples collected from rivers, lakes, and canals in Berlin. Residues of pharmaceuticals and N-(phenylsulfonyl)-sarcosine originating from various sewage treatment plants effluents were found at concentrations up to the mu g/L-level in the surface water. whereas the concentrations of polar pesticides such as dichlorprop and mecoprop were always below 0.1 mu g/L. The pharmaceuticals most frequently detected in the surface water samples include clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propihenazone, and two other drug metabolites. Additional investigations of groundwater wells of a drinking water plant have shown that polar contaminants such as drug residues or N-(phenylsulfonyl)-sarcosine easily leach through the subsoil into the groundwater aquifers when contaminated surface water is used for groundwater recharge in drinking water production.

AB Low-temperature or psychrophilic (<20 degrees C) anaerobic digestion (PAD) has recently been demonstrated as a cost-effective option for the treatment of a range of wastewater categories. The aim of this work was 2-fold: (1) to screen three anaerobic sludges, obtained from full-scale reactors, with respect to suitability for PAD of pharmaceutical-like, solvent-contaminated wastewater; (2) to assess the feasibility of PAD of this wastewater category. Toxicity thresholds of key trophic groups within three candidate biomass samples were assessed against solvents prevalent in pharmaceutical wastewaters (propanol, methanol and acetone). Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) assays indicated that the metabolic optimum of each candidate biomass was within the mesophilic range. One biomass sample exhibited higher SMA assays than the other candidate samples and was also the sample least methanogenically inhibited by the addition of solvents to batch cultures. This sludge was selected as the biomass of choice for laboratory-scale trials. Two identical expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-based anaerobic reactors were used for the treatment of solvent-contaminated wastewater at 15 degrees C, and at applied organic loading rates (OLRs) of 5-20 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3)d(-1). COD removal efficiencies of 60-70% were achieved during the 450 day trial. In addition, SMA assays carried out at the conclusion of the trial indicated the development of a putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals have been focusing international attention for a few decades. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a common drug that is widely found in hospital and wastewater treatment plants effluents, as well as in rivers. In this work, the feasibility of CIP degradation by ultrasound process at high frequency is discussed and sonolysis, sonolysis with hydrogen peroxide and sono-Fenton are evaluated. The amounts of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions (Fe2+) needed were optimized using response surface methodology. Best results were obtained with the sono-Fenton process resulting in a total pharmaceutical degradation within 15 min and a mineralization greater than 60% after 1 h. Optimal conditions were tested on a real matrix from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Even if the degradation of the pollutants by sono-Fenton was hampered, the removal efficiency of both CIP and total organic carbon (TOC) is interesting as an increase in the biodegradability of the wastewater is found. These results show that sono-Fenton oxidation can be a promising pretreatment process for pharmaceutical-containing wastewaters.

AB Population growth has led to increased global discharges of wastewater. Contaminants that are not fully removed during wastewater treatment, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), may negatively affect aquatic ecosystems. PPCPs can bioaccumulate causing adverse health effects and behavioural changes in exposed fish. To assess the impact of PPCPs on wild fish, and to assess whether caged fish could be used as a surrogate for resident wild fish in future monitoring, we caged goldfish in a marsh affected by discharges of wastewater effluents (Cootes Paradise, Lake Ontario, Canada). We collected plasma from resident wild goldfish, and from goldfish that we caged in the marsh for three weeks. We analyzed the plasma proteome and metabolome of both wild and caged fish. We also compared proteomic and metabolic responses in caged and wild fish from the marsh to fish caged at a reference site (Jordan Harbour Conservation Area). We identified significant changes in expression of over 250 molecules that were related to liver necrosis, accumulation and synthesis of lipids, synthesis of cyclic AMP, and the quantity of intracellular calcium in fish from the wastewater affected marsh. Our results suggest that PPCPs could be affecting the health of wild fish populations.

AB An assessment of the concentrations of thirteen different therapeutic pharmaceutical compounds was conducted on water samples obtained from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using solid phase extraction and high-and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS and UHPLC-MS/MS), was carried out.
   The target compounds included ketoprofen and naproxen (anti-inflammatories), bezafibrate (lipid-regulating), carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), metamizole (analgesic), atenolol (beta-blocker), paraxanthine (stimulant), fluoxetine (antidepressant), and levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin (fluoroquinolone antibiotics). The relative standard deviations obtained in method were below 11%, while the detection and quantification limits were in the range of 0.3 -97.4 ng.L-1 and 1.1 -324.7 ng.L-1, respectively. The water samples were collected from two different WWTPs located on the island of Gran Canaria in Spain over a period of one year. The first WWTP (denoted as WWTP1) used conventional activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater, while the other plant (WWTP2) employed a membrane bioreactor system for wastewater treatment.
   Most of the pharmaceutical compounds detected in this study during the sampling periods were found to have concentrations ranging between 0.02 and 34.81 mu.L-1.

AB This study evaluated the occurrence and distribution of 81 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the vulnerable area of the Ebro Delta region (Catalonia, Spain), to assess the environmental impact of wastewater treatment plants discharge to coastal environments. The occurrence of PhACs was followed along the wastewater-recipient water-sediment chain until they reach estuaries and the Mediterranean Sea. Water and sediment samples were collected in an integrated way at different sampling points covering three different seasons in reaches of the Ebro River located upstream and downstream from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surrounding channels, estuaries, and the associated receiving seawater. 28 out of the 57 compounds detected in effluent wastewater were positively identified in estuary and seawaters, revealing that WWTP discharges are an important source of contamination in coastal environments and that PhACs are suitable markers of urban contamination in these areas. The substances with the highest frequency of detection belonged to the groups of analgesics/anti-inflammatories (acetaminophen, salicylic acid), antihypertensives (valsartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine), and antibiotics (clarithromycin, trimethoprim). In general, a decrease in concentration was observed from inland sampling points towards the Mediterranean Sea, resulting from a dilution in the recipient marine water bodies. A reduced number of PhACs, at concentrations ranging from0.1 to 12.5 ng g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) was detected in sediment samples, indicating that sorption is a minor natural attenuation pathway for these compounds. Finally, a prioritization strategy, based on the compounds concentration and frequency of detection in seawater, removal efficiency in WWTP, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity to marine organisms and persistency, was used to highlight the PhACs of major ecological concern and that could be used as relevant indicators of wastewater contamination in coastal environments.

AB This study presents findings on an assessment of the effect of continuous and batch feeding strategies on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals from synthetic wastewater. Six mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands, including three horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands and three sand filters, were set up at the campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The findings showed that ibuprofen and diclofenac removal in the wetlands was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in the batch versus continuous mode. In contrast, naproxen and carbamazepine showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in elimination under either feeding strategy. Our results also clearly showed that the presence of plants exerts a stimulatory effect on pharmaceutical removal for ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen in batch and continuous mode. Estimation of the quantitative role of this stimulatory effect on pharmaceutical elimination of batch operation as compared with the effect of the presence of the higher plant alone showed that batch operation may account for 40 to 87% of the contribution conferred by the aquatic plant. The findings of this study imply that where maximal removal of pharmaceutical compounds is desired, periodic draining and filling might be the preferred operational strategy for full-scale, subsurface flow constructed wetlands.

AB The potential risks associated with antibiotics present in the Swedish environment were assessed using concentrations found in hospital effluent, and sewage treatment waters and sludge, in combination with data on their environmental effects obtained from the literature. For the aqueous environment, measured environmental concentrations and effect/no observed effect concentration ratios were much lower than one in most cases. The only exceptions, where concentrations of the investigated substances were high enough to pose potential risks, were the concentrations of the two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, in the hospital effluent. Treating digested dewatered sludge by heat did not fully eliminate norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin, thus pellets may still contain high amounts of these substances (sub to low mg kg(-1) dw). In leaching tests less than 1% of the amounts of these fluoroquinolones in the sludge or pellets reached the aqueous phase, indicating that their mobility is limited if sludge is used to fertilize soil.

AB Aim: Analysis of wastewater samples can be used to assess population drug use, but reporting and statistical issues have limited the utility of the approach for epidemiology due to analytical results that are below the limit of quantification or detection. Unobserved or non-quantifiable-censored-data are common and likely to persist as the methodology is applied to more municipalities and a broader array of substances. We demonstrate the use of censored data techniques and account for measurement errors to explore distributions and annual estimates of the daily mean level of drugs excreted per capita. Measurements: Daily 24-hour composite wastewater samples for 56 days in 2009 were obtained using a random sample stratified by day of week and season for 19 municipalities in the Northwest region of the U.S.
   Methods: Methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone were identified and quantified in wastewater samples. Four statistical approaches (reporting censoring, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Kaplan-Meier estimates, or complete data calculations) were used to estimate an annual average, including confidence bounds where appropriate, dependent upon the amount of censoring in the data.
   Findings: The proportion of days within a year with censored data varied greatly by drug across the 19 municipalities, with MDMA varying the most (4% to 94% of observations censored). The different statistical approaches each needed to be used given the levels of censoring of measured drug concentrations. Figures incorporating confidence bounds allow visualization of the data that facilitates appropriate comparisons across municipalities. Conclusions: Results from wastewater sampling that are below detection or quantification limits contain important information and can be incorporated to create a more complete and valid estimate of drug excretion.

AB The present study aims at uncovering valorisation opportunities in the Greek slaughtering industry related to wastewater and animal by-products exploitation. To this end, 12 Greek slaughterhouses were studied, while literature review of published work on wastewater and animal by-products treatment and valorisation was also conducted. Based on the recording of the existing situation in Greece, it was observed that all slaughterhouses operate biological wastewater treatment plants. The activated sludge process was mostly applied. Animal by-products derived from the operation of the slaughterhouses were mainly treated inside the units through incineration or rendering. In many of the slaughterhouses, animal by-products were treated as being category 1 and, thus, potential by-product valorisation remained unexploited. Moreover, ashes from the incineration of animal by-products and of rendering residues were mainly sent to landfills. Considering the above, in order to add value to the Greek slaughtering industry, anaerobic digestion could be applied instead of the activated sludge process or as a first step prior to aerobic treatment of wastewater resulting in both wastewater treatment and biogas generation. Anaerobic digestion is also an attractive valorisation opportunity for treating animal by-products (category 3 and category 2 after pressure sterilisation). Animal by-products category 3 can also be exploited for the extraction of substances and the subsequent manufacture of feedstuffs, cosmetics or medicinal products. Moreover, separately collected blood can be utilised for the recovery of bioactive peptides to be used in the pharmaceutical industry or as a protein source for pet food. Finally, future valorisation potentials for the Greek slaughtering sector can be found in the ash exploitation as a phosphorous source.

AB This study investigated for the first time the occurrence of selected synthetic hormones including 17-ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, norethindrone and cyproterone acetate in Malaysian tropical waters. Samples were collected from the effluents of five sewage treatment plants (STPs) and at seven stations along the Langat River in Selangor, Malaysia, and its main tributaries. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In Langat river samples, only levonorgestrel and cyproterone acetate were found at 50% and 3.3% frequency. The concentrations detected for levonorgestrel ranged from less than the method detection limit (<MDL) to 213ngL(-1) and from<MDL to 76ngL(-1) for cyproterone acetate. For the STP effluent samples, levonorgestrel was <MDL in all samples and the concentrations detected were in the range<MDL - 262ngL(-1) for cyproterone acetate,<MDL -11336ngL(-1) for norethindrone and<MDL - 1898ngL(-1) for 17-ethinylestradiol.

AB An analytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of trace amounts of nine corticosteroids in sewage-treatment-plant (STP) samples. The compounds studied were prednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, prednisolone acetate, hydrocortisone acetate, betamethasone valerate, and betamethasone dipropionate. The method involves concentration and purification of analytes by solid-phase extraction, subsequent separation by liquid chromatography, and detection by mass spectrometry. Quantitative analysis was performed by the standard addition method. Instrument detection limits were in the range 1.6-9.4 pg for the target compounds. Recoveries were 57.2-106.7% in the STP influent sample and 59.1-112.5% in the STP effluent sample with relative standard deviations of 8.7-19.2% and 7.3-17.1%, respectively. This method was used for the determination of these chemicals in STP samples from Takase (Funabashi, Japan); some corticosteroids were determined at levels as low as single nanograms per liter.

AB The present study analyzed the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) from synthetic and pharmaceutical wastewater streams using an adsorption technique by magnetite coated sand. In this context, batch experiments were performed using synthetic and pharmaceutical wastewater to analyze the influence of contact time and adsorbent dose on the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) in two different phases. Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) coated sand adsorbent was prepared by the coprecipitation method. The performances of the two batch reactors treating synthetic and pharmaceutical wastewater were compared to analyze the influence of contact time and adsorbent dose on Cr(VI) removal efficiency. In particular, different conditions of contact time and adsorbate concentration on the sorption process were studied. The adsorbent materials were further characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and the analysis of the Cr(VI) was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Results obtained from the first phase of the study showed that for initial concentrations of 1 mg/L for both synthetic and pharmaceutical wastes, the remaining concentrations were determined to be 0.022 and 0.029 mg/L, respectively. The kinetic adsorption isotherms models have shown that the adsorbent follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The isotherms were well fitted with Langmuir and Redlich-Peterson model, indicating monolayer adsorption of hexavalent Cr on the magnetite coated sand surface. However, the presence of other adsorbates in pharmaceutical wastewater influences the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) minutely. It can be inferred from the study that the adsorbent can be used for heavy metal treatment in a cost-effective manner since the magnetite is coated on the sand; it eliminates the problem of extraction of nanoparticles from treated wastewater and can be removed by a simple filtration process.

AB A user-friendly, menu-driven simulation software tool has been developed for the first time to optimize and analyze the system performance of an advanced continuous membrane-integrated pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. The software allows pre-analysis and manipulation of input data which helps in optimization and shows the software performance visually on a graphical platform. Moreover, the software helps the user to "visualize" the effects of the operating parameters through its model-predicted output profiles. The software is based on a dynamic mathematical model, developed for a systematically integrated forward osmosis-nanofiltration process for removal of toxic organic compounds from pharmaceutical wastewater. The model-predicted values have been observed to corroborate well with the extensive experimental investigations which were found to be consistent under varying operating conditions like operating pressure, operating flow rate, and draw solute concentration. Low values of the relative error (RE=0.09) and high values of Willmott-d-index (d(will)=0.981) reflected a high degree of accuracy and reliability of the software. This software is likely to be a very efficient tool for system design or simulation of an advanced membrane-integrated treatment plant for hazardous wastewater.

AB The objective of this work was to identify relevant wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) parameters and underlying microbial processes that influence the biotransformation of a diverse set of micropollutants. To do this, we determined biotransformation rate constants for ten organic micropollutants in batch reactors seeded with activated sludge from ten diverse WWTPs. The estimated biotransformation rate constants for each compound ranged between one and four orders of magnitude among the ten WWTPs. The biotransformation rate constants were tested for statistical associations with various WWTP process parameters, amoA transcript abundance, and acetylene-inhibited monooxygenase activity. We determined that (i) ammonia removal associates with oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; (ii) archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts associate with both ammonia removal and oxidative rnicropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; and (iii) the activity of acetylene-inhibited monooxygenases (including ammonia monooxygenase) associates with ammonia removal and the biotransformation rate of isoproturon, but does not associate with all oxidative micropollutant biotransformations. In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that ammonia removal and amoA transcript abundance can potentially be predictors of oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reactions, but that the biochemical mechanism is not necessarily linked to ammonia monooxygenase activity.

AB The distribution and occurrence of 15 antibiotics in surface water of the Pearl River System (Liuxi River, Shijing River and Zhujiang River) and effluents of four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated in two sampling events representing wet season and dry season by using rapid resolution liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) in positive ionization mode. Only eight antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, roxithromycin, erythromycin-H2O and norfloxacin) were detected in the water samples of the three rivers and the effluents. The detection frequencies and levels of antibiotics in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season. This could be attributed to the dilution effects in the wet season and relatively lower temperature in the dry season under which antibiotics could persist for a longer period. The levels of the detected antibiotics in different sites are generally in a decreasing order as follows: Shijing River >= WWTP effluent >= Zhujiang River >= Liuxi River. Risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotients showed that only erythromycin-H2O and roxithromycin detected in the Pearl Rivers might have adverse effects on aquatic organisms.

AB Water contamination by discharge of untreated or poorly treated wastewater into water bodies is a current issue that may cause harm to humans. Water quality assessment targets general parameters, which often misleads to underestimation of their implication in the environment. Acute and genotoxicity assays using Daphnia magna is a reliable tool for testing deleterious effects of wastewater exposure. This paper aimed at evaluating acute ecotoxicity as well as genotoxicity of a biological treatment system composed by an anaerobic bioreactor (AR), algal turf scrubber (ATS), followed by two downflow constructed wetlands (CW). The university's wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) composed by an equalization tank (ET), an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), followed by an aerobic bioreactor (AB) was also assessed for acute and genotoxicity. Our results showed the acute ecotoxicity ranged from moderately to extremely toxic, and from nontoxic to moderately toxic for ET and AB. For AR, most samples were moderately toxic. The outflow from ATS and CW's tanks completely eliminated acute toxicity and genotoxicity evidencing that the proposed system combining ATS and vertical CWs is suitable for treating sanitary wastewater.

AB The effectivity of different treatment stages at two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in Oslo, Norway, to remove antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli from municipal wastewater was investigated. The WWTPs were effective in reducing the total cultivable E. coli. The E. coli in WWTP samples were mainly resistant to ampicillin (6-27%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (5-24%), and, to a lesser extent, tetracycline (3-14%) and ciprofloxacin (0-7%). In the first WWTP, a clear decrease in the percentage of E. coli resistant to these antibiotics was found, with the main removal occurring during physical/chemical treatment. In the second WWTP, the percentage of cultivable resistant E. coli did not display a considerable change. During laboratory-scale membrane filtration of WWTP effluents using ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes, all E. coli, including those resistant to antibiotics, were removed completely. The results imply that UF and NF processes are potent measures to remove antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) during post-treatment of WWTP effluents, thus reducing the potential spread of antibiotic resistance in the receiving aquatic environment.

AB In this study, a fully automated analytical method, based on online solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-LC-MS/MS), has been developed and optimized for the quantification of 10 illicit drugs and metabolites in environmentally aqueous samples collected from China. The particular attention was devoted to minimize the matrix effects through a washing step, which washed out the interferences effectively and helped to reduce the matrix effect significantly. The key advantages of the method are high sensitivity, selectivity and reliability of results, smaller sample manipulation, full automation, and fairly high throughput. The whole procedure was then successfully applied in the analysis of various surface water and wastewater effluents samples. Pseudoephedrine have been detected at trace levels (several tens ng L-1 or less), while MDA, MDMA, benzoylecgonine and methadone were below the LOQ in all samples. Caffeine, cotinine and paraxanthine, which may be derived from medicines and foods, were detected with the highest frequencies and concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 166 emerging compounds and four heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Hg and Pb) in treated wastewater and groundwater has been monitored at the Llobregat delta (Barcelona, Spain) over a period of 3 years. Selected compounds were pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs), dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and priority substances included in the 2008/105/CE Directive. Analysis was performed in tertiary treated wastewater (TWW), after an additional treatment of ultrafiltration reverse osmosis and UV disinfection, and groundwater from a deep confined aquifer. This aquifer is artificially recharged with TWW through injection wells. After the advanced treatment, 38 pharmaceuticals, 9 PCPs, 9 pesticides and 7 PAHs still showed a frequency of detection higher than 25% in the TWW, although at low concentration levels (ng/l). Not all active compounds found in the TWW were present in groundwater, indicating possible degradation within the aquifer media after the injection. A number of chemicals. mainly 10 pesticides and 10 pharmaceuticals were only present in groundwater samples, confirming a different origin than the injected TWIN, probably agricultural activities and/or infiltration of poorly treated wastewater.

AB Reverse osmosis process has great potential in treatment of water and wastewater containing undesirable dissolved species. In the real world, the wastewater contains mixtures of ions. Generally, the presence of particular substances may affect the removal of specific ions and harmful substances in wastewater treatment. In this work, a Filmtec TW30HP-4641 RO element (polyamide, thin-film composite) with the capacity of 14.38 m(3)/d was employed for wastewater treatment in Exir Pharmaceutical Co. (Borojerd, Iran). The rejections of individual nitrite, nitrate, and sulfite ions were around 91, 93, and 95%, respectively. However, the addition of KH2PO4 to the solution containing nitrite and nitrate ions improved the rejection up to 99%. Polyamide has electronic lone-pair in amino group that can make a resonance structure with carbonyl segment. The feed solution containing potassium and di-hydrogen phosphate ions may establish binding with membrane. The binding of potassium ions to the electronic lone-pair of membrane hold H2PO4 (-) ions and provide a negative layer on the surface of membrane. Diffusion of anions through the membrane is minimized by establishment of the proposed negative layer. This improves the ion rejection capability of the membrane.

AB The presence of high concentration antibiotics in wastewater can disturb the stability of biological wastewater treatment systems and promote generation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the treatment. To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 degrees C for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 +/- 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial potency (from 874 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 mg L-1 and from 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, an average COD removal rate of 83.2%, 78.5% and 68.9% was achieved at an organic loading rate of 33, 4.8 and 5.9 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), respectively. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tetracycline (tet) genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron (intI1)) in anaerobic sludge on day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those in inoculated sludge on day 0 (P < 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3720 +/- 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 +/- 4% at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1.2 +/- 0.2 kg m(-3) d(-1), and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P < 0.01). The above result demonstrated that enhanced hydrolysis as a pretreatment method could enable efficient anaerobic treatment of oxytetracycline production wastewater containing high concentrations of oxytetracycline with significantly lower generation of ARGs.

AB The removal efficiencies and accumulated concentrations of oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin in three pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with different flow configurations (surface, horizontal subsurface, and vertical subsurface flow) were investigated. The results indicated that the average mass removal efficiencies of the CWs for the target antibiotics in one year of treatment ranged from 85 to 99%, and the vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands exhibited the highest and most stable removal efficiencies for oxytetracycline (99 +/- 0.27%) and ciprofloxacin (97 +/- 0.26%). The influence of seasonal changes on the removal efficiencies of oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin in CWs was insignificant. The higher accumulated antibiotic concentrations and antibiotic-degrading bacteria abundances indicated that substrate adsorption and biodegradation were the predominant pathways affecting the antibiotic removal efficiency of wetlands. The concentration of accumulated ciprofloxacin in soil and oyster shell (84-124 and 83-115 mu g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than that of oxytetracycline (37-81 and 3-17 mu g kg(-1)). In addition, analysis results based on pilot-scale CWs also indicated that the influence of the type of CW on the bacterial community was more significant than the wetland substrate and residual concentration of antibiotics.

AB Pharmaceutical substances have been detected in sewage effluents as well as receiving waters in many parts of the world. To assess the fate and removal of these compounds within sewage treatment plants, an understanding of their partitioning behavior between the solid and aqueous phases is critical. Therefore, a preliminary study was conducted to ascertain an understanding of the binding behavior of five drug substances sorbing to the solid phase in a laboratory scale-activated sludge plant (Husmann unit). For comparison, uncontaminated river sediment was also used as a substrate. All of the compounds tested partitioned more readily to the sludge than the sediment, likely because of the former's higher organic carbon content. Partitioning to the solid phase correlated roughly with predicted log K-ow values. A period of initial sorption was followed by a phase of desorption, and net absorption of the selected drugs (with the exception of mefenamic acid) after 5 hours of mixing was minimal.

AB Discharge of organic load from treated wastewater may cause environmental eutrophication. Recently, fungi have gained much attention due to their removal of pharmaceutical substances by enzymatic degradation and adsorption. However, the fungal effect in removing nutrients is less investigated. Therefore, two fungal species, the white-rot fungus T. versicolor as a laboratory strain and the mold A. luchuensis as an environmental isolate from the municipal wastewater treatment plant, were studied to determine the fungal potential for phosphorus, nitrogen, and the total organic carbon removal from municipal wastewater, carrying out a batch scale experiment to a fluidized bed pelleted bioreactor. During the batch scale experiment, the total removal (99.9 %) of phosphorus by T. versicolor was attained after a 6 h-long incubation period while the maximal removal efficiency (99.9 %) for phosphorus from A. luchuensis was gained after an incubation period of 24 h. Furthermore, both fungi showed that the pH adjustment to 5.5 kept the concentration of nitrogen constant and stabilized the total organic carbon reduction process for the entire incubation period. The results from the fluidized bed bioreactor demonstrated opposite tendencies on a nutrient removal comparing to a batch experiment where no significant effect on phosphorus, nitrogen, and total organics carbon reduction was observed. The obtained results from this study of batch and fluidized bed bioreactor experiments are a promising starting point for a successful fungal treatment optimization and application to wastewater treatment.

AB This study focuses on developing a method for the effective removal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketoprofen, fenoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and carbamazepine from wastewater using water-soluble proteins, which were extracted from Moringa stenopetala seeds. The functional groups and the surface charge of water-soluble protein powder were evaluated using FTIR and Zetasizer Nano ZS. Different parameters that affect the removal of selected pharmaceuticals such as initial concentration, the amount of the removing material and pH were optimized. The optimized method was applied to real wastewater samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant. A 100% removal was observed for all analytes under optimum conditions (4 mg dose of watersoluble protein powder, 1 ppm concentration of mixture a NSAIDs and at pH 3) for a synthetic standard solution prepared in ultra-high purity water. A slight decrease in the removal efficiency for the NSAIDs (82-86%) was observed when the water-soluble protein was applied to real wastewater samples. Despite the slight drop, such levels are still higher than those achieved with most advanced technologies and comparable with others. The attractiveness of this approach is its efficiency, environmental friendliness and that it is cost effective. The results thus demonstrate the capacity of water-soluble protein of Moringa stenopetala seed as an effective and efficient material for the removal of pharmaceutical drugs from environmental waters.

AB Many countries are utilizing reclaimed waste-water for agriculture as water demands due to drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations. Unfortunately, wastewater often contains biologically active, pseudopersistant pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Runoff from agriculture and effluent from wastewater treatment plants also contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on an agricultural pest, the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer, Hemiptera: Aphididae). Second instar nymphs were transferred to bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) that were grown hydroponically. Treatment plants were spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations found in reclaimed wastewater. M. persicae displayed no differences in population growth or microbial community differences due to chemical treatments. Plants, however, displayed significant growth reduction in antibiotic and mixture treatments, specifically in wet root masses. Antibiotic treatment masses were significantly reduced in the total and root wet masses. Mixture treatments displayed an overall reduction in plant root wet mass. Our results suggest that the use of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation would not affect aphid populations, but could hinder or delay crop production.

AB A methodology used to estimate the percentage of wastewater effluent in an otherwise pristine water site is proposed on the basis of the weighted mean of the level of a consortium of indicator pollutants. This method considers the levels of uncertainty in the evaluation of each of the indicators in the site, potential effluent sources, and uncontaminated surroundings. A detailed demonstrative study was conducted on a site that is potentially subject to wastewater leakage. The research concentrated on several perched springs that are influenced to an unknown extent by agricultural communities. A comparison was made to a heavily contaminated site receiving wastewater effluent and surface water runoff. We investigated six springs in two nearby ridges where fecal contamination was detected in the past; the major sources of pollution in the area have since been diverted to a wastewater treatment system. We used chloride, acesulfame, and carbamazepine as domestic pollution tracers. Good correlation (R-2 > 0.86) was observed between the mixing ratio predictions based on the two organic tracers (the slope of the linear regression was 1.05), whereas the chloride predictions differed considerably. This methodology is potentially useful, particularly for cases in which detailed hydrological modeling is unavailable but in which quantification of wastewater penetration is required. We demonstrate that the use of more than one tracer for estimation of the mixing ratio reduces the combined uncertainty level associated with the estimate and can also help to disqualify biased tracers.

AB Hospitals' effluents contain a considerable amount of chemicals. Considering the significant volume of wastewater discharged by hospitals, the presence of these chemicals represents a real threat to the environment and human health. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo and in vitro genotoxicities of three wastewater effluents collected from Tunisian hospitals. The liver of Swiss albino male mice, previously treated with different doses of the hospital wastewaters, was used as a model to detect DNA fragmentation. Our results showed all the hospital effluents caused significant qualitative and quantitative hazards in hepatic DNA. The wastewater collected from Sfax hospital exhibited the highest genotoxic effect, which may be explained by the presence in this effluent of some toxic micropolluants. There was a significant increase in genotoxicity, proportionally to the concentration of effluent. However, the vitotox assay did not show any significant genotoxicity on Salmonella typhimurium TA104 in the presence or absence of microsomal fraction S9. The ratio gentox/cytox was lower than the threshold 1.5. This study assessed the toxicological risk issued from Tunisian hospital wastewaters, which is potentially very harmful, and it has been pointed out that wastewater treatment requires special attention.

AB Excessive use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their release into the water environment have become a major challenge since most of the wastewater treatment options are not equipped to treat these micro-contaminants. Some advanced technologies are reported to be effective for PPCPs treatment in wastewater but cost of those technologies remains as major drawback. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a low-cost technology for wastewater treatment; however, their performance in term of PPCPs removal has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of selected aquatic plants and iron-rich media for removal of PPCPs from wastewater. Four aquatic plants were selected in the preliminary testing, where vetiver was recognized to be the most appropriate plant since it responded well to high dose of PPCPs. The experimental results revealed the increased efficiency of PPCPs removal at a low PPCPs dose. The removal of acetaminophen, amoxicillin and beta-estradiol were found to be 97.5%-98.4%, 73.7%-92.2% and 75.0%-89.2%, respectively.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of combined Fenton oxidation and membrane filtration for the treatment of a real process pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the chemical synthesis of etodolaca pharmaceutical active compound. In single Fenton oxidation experiments, the highest process efficiencies (84% chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 95% UV254) were obtained at the H2O2/Fe2+=40 ratio. However, regarding the costs of reagents, the optimum molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ was selected as 20 with COD removal efficiency of 82%. Although COD could not be reduced to discharge standards, etodolac removal is fixed close to 100%. Higher flux, higher rejection rates, and lower flux decline were obtained from the combined Fenton oxidation and nanofiltration (NF) of the raw wastewater from chemical synthesis process. Although effective removals of etodolac (>99.5%) were obtained for combined and single systems, single-stage NF treatment was also insufficient for the removal of organic matter. Combined Fenton oxidation and NF treatment was found to be a promising method for wastewater from chemical synthesis processes of pharmaceutical industry containing etodolac. FT-IR spectrums showed that the calcium salts could be the main foulants on the NF membrane surface.

AB Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been widely studied for adsorption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). However, effluent organic matter (EfOM) is found to compete with PPCP for sorption sites on MWCNT, thereby markedly reducing the adsorptive capacities of MWCNT for PPCP in wastewater effluent. Herein, we report that precoagulation of secondary wastewater effluent effectively mitigated the competitive adsorption of EfOM and increased the adsorption capacities of MWCNT for acetaminophen, caffeine, triclosan, and carbendazim by up to 34%. Analyses of the coagulated waters using size exclusion chromatography and three-dimensional fluorescence spectrophotometry revealed that precoagulation primarily removed biopolymers and humic substances; the latter is known to suppress PPCP adsorption onto MWCNT. Moreover, the removal of EfOM by precoagulation reduced membrane permeability decrement and relieved membrane fouling. These results suggest that coagulation, a conventional technique widely used by water treatment plants, is a viable pretreatment approach for filtration of PPCP in wastewater by MWCNT. This finding also demonstrates the potential of integrating conventional technology and novel nanotechnology for cost-effective, advanced wastewater treatment.

AB Many countries are utilizing reclaimed wastewater for agriculture because drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations are increasing water demands. Unfortunately, wastewater often contains biologically active, pseudopersistent pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Runoff from farms and output from wastewater treatment plants also contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on an agricultural pest, Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Larvae were reared on artificial diets spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Trichoplusia ni showed increased developmental time and mortality when reared on artificial diets containing antibiotics, hormones, or a mixture of contaminants. Mortality was also increased when T. ni were reared on tomatoes grown hydroponically with the same concentrations of antibiotics. The antibiotic-treated plants translocated ciprofloxacin through their tissues to roots, shoots, and leaves. Microbial communities of T. ni changed substantially between developmental stages and when exposed to CECs in their diets. Our results suggest that use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation of crops can affect the developmental biology and microbial communities of an insect of agricultural importance.

AB Powdered LaCu0.5Mn0.5O3 perovskite was successfully conformed in a reticulated macroporous structure to be tested in an up-flow catalytic packed bed reactor as on-site pre-treatment of pharmaceutical micropollutants in a hospital wastewater. Initially, the effect of the pH, the temperature and the hydrogen peroxide were studied using the hospital wastewater fortified with carbamazepine (CZP) in order to determine the best operation conditions. The reticulated porous perovskite catalyst evidenced a remarkable activity and stability for 70 h on continuous operation in a catalytic packed bed reactor operated at initial pH of ca. 5.5, 70 degrees C and moderate dosage of hydrogen peroxide (700 mg/L). Under these conditions, the heterogeneous Fenton-like catalytic system achieved an effective removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants of the hospital wastewater in the real range of mu g/L, such as antineoplastic drugs, antibiotics, X-ray contrast agent, etc. Most of them were eliminated with removal degrees above 90-95%, being their remaining concentration below the predicted non-effect concentration (PNEC) for aquatic organisms.

AB In biological wastewater treatments, microbial populations of the so-called activated sludge work together in the abatement of pollutants. In this work, the metabolic behavior of the biomass of a lab-scale plant treating industrial pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated through a metaproteomic approach. The complete treatment process included a membrane biological reactor (MBR) coupled with an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for partial breakdown of non-biodegradable molecules. Proteins from biomass samples collected pre- and post-AOP application were investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), mass spectrometry (MS), and finally identified by database search. Results showed that most proteins remained constant between pre- and post-AOP. Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) belonging to Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii appeared as the most constantly expressed protein in the studied consortium. Other identified proteins belonging to Hyphomicrobium spp. revealed a predominant methylotrophic metabolism, and H. zavarzinii appeared as a key actor in the studied microbial community.

AB Attempts were made in this study to examine the combined polyferric sulfate (PFS) coagulation, Fenton and sedimentation process for treatment of non-degradable antibiotic fermentation wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 66.6% of color and 72.4% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were removed under the optimum conditions of PFS dosage 200 mg/L and pH 4.0. In addition, optimal parameters of Fenton process were determined to be 150 mg/L of H2O2 dosage, 120 mg/L of FeSO4 and 1 h of reaction time. When Fenton treated effluent was controlled at pH 7.0, the pollutants could be further removed by sedimentation process. The overall color, COD and suspended solids (SS) removal reached 97.3%. 96.9% and 86.7% under selected conditions, respectively. Thus this study might offer an effective way for wastewater treatment of antibiotics manufacturer and pharmaceutical industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing concern worldwide regarding the presence of emerging contaminants in biosolids calls for a better understanding of how different treatment technologies at water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) can influence concentrations prior to biosolids land application. This study focuses on the influence of solids treatment via the Cambi Thermal Hydrolysis Process " in conjunction with anaerobic digestion (TH-AD) on concentrations of triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), and their transformation products in biosolids and sludges. Concentrations of the target analytes in biosolids from the TH-AD process (Class A), sludges from the individual TH-AD treatment steps, and limed biosolids (Class B) from the same WRRF were compared. TCC concentrations were significantly lower in Class A biosolids than those in the Class B product - a removal that occurred during thermal hydrolysis. Concentrations of TCS, methyl triclosan, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, conversely, increased during anaerobic digestion, leading to significantly higher concentrations of these compounds in Class A biosolids when compared to Class B biosolids. Implementation of the TH-AD process had mixed effect on contaminant concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We analyzed 13 psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites in wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent and the possibility of their degradation by biological and chemical processes. Tramadol (413-853 ng/L) and methamphetamine (460-682 ng/L) were the most concentrated compounds in the wastewater in winter and summer, respectively. A significant decrease in the concentration of tramadol in wastewater was measured during the summer. The lowest efficiency was observed for tramadol, venlafaxine, citalopram and oxazepam (similar to 10%) and the highest efficiency was observed for amphetamine and THC-COOH (similar to 80%). The efficiency of compound degradation via the Fenton reaction, a modified Fenton reaction and different degradation (by algae, wood-rotting fungi and enzymes at influent versus effluent) was determined. The Fenton reaction and its modification were efficient at eliminating these substances in comparison with the tested biological processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenols (NPs), with a high potential to cause endocrine disruption, have been identified at levels of nanograms per liter and even micrograms per liter in effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a cost-effective wastewater treatment alternative due to the low operational cost, reduced energy consumption, and lower sludge production, and have shown promising performance for treating these compounds. A CW pilot study was undertaken todetermine its potential to remove BPA and NP from municipal wastewater. Three CWs were used: the first CW was planted with Heliconia sp., a second CW was planted with Phragmites sp., and the third CW was an unplanted control. The removal efficiency of the Heliconia-CW was 73 +/- 19% for BPA and 63 +/- 20% for NP, which was more efficient than the Phragmites-CW (BPA 70 +/- 28% and NP 52 +/- 23%) and the unplanted-CW (BPA 62 +/- 33% and NP 25 +/- 37%). The higher capacity of the Heliconia-CW for BPA and NP removal suggests that a native plant from the tropics can contribute to a better performance of CW for removing these compounds.

AB Pharmaceuticals in wastewater have clearly raised concern and a broad range of analytical methods has been used to assess the risk as accurately as possible. The aim of our study was to measure and compare the concentrations of atorvastatin, bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fluoxetine, metoprolol, and sertraline in wastewater samples taken from one municipal and one hospital wastewater treatment plant in Slovenia and to predict the potential environmental burden using the risk quotient. In both effluents only clofibric acid and fluoxetine were not detected. The measured concentrations of the remaining seven pharmaceuticals varied between the ng L-1 and the mu g L-1 range. Hospital effluent showed higher concentrations, except for diclofenac and carbamazepine. However, high risk quotient was found only for ciprofloxacin and diclofenac in both municipal and hospital effluent. In conclusion, our method can provide a useful tool for systematic monitoring of pharmaceuticals commonly found in wastewater, which will enable a reliable assessment of the risks for the aquatic biota and humans. Knowing the risks will help to plan wastewater treatment and preserve our environment.

AB Reduction in the concentration of pharmaceuticals present in wastewater has been attributed to sorption and biodegradation. However, the contribution of these processes has not been fully characterized. Previous studies have reported varying effects of solution pH and concentration on sorption behavior of pharmaceuticals in different absorbents including activated carbon waste and zeolites. Here we report the pH and concentration effect on sorption of two common anti-inflammatory drugs, viz., ibuprofen and naproxen, on suspended solids in simulated domestic wastewater (SDWW). Batch experiments were conducted at various pH levels, viz., 3.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, and concentration, viz., 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mu g L-1. The results showed that both ibuprofen and naproxen have higher sorption at lower pH values and at higher concentration. It was found that the data were comparatively well fitted to the Redlich-Peterson isotherm. The study revealed that both ibuprofen and naproxen can be removed from wastewater by the sorption process achieved by lowering the pH to values lower than pK(a) and maintaining the concentration at an optimal value.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals or their active metabolites in surface and ground waters has been recently reported as mainly due to an incomplete removal of these pollutants in sewage treatment plants (STP). Advanced oxidation processes may represent a suitable tool to reduce environmental release of these species by enhancing the global efficiency of reduction of pharmaceuticals in the municipal sewage plant effluents. The present work aims at assessing the kinetics of abatement from aqueous solutions of clofibric acid (a metabolite of the blood lipid regulator clofibrate) which has been found in surface, ground and drinking waters. Ozonation and hydrogen peroxide photolysis are capable of fast removal of this species in aqueous solution, with an almost complete conversion of the organic chlorine content into chloride ions for the investigated reaction conditions. A validation of assessed kinetics at clofibric acid concentrations as low as those found in STP effluents is presented for both systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical method to determine a selection of 27 frequently prescribed and consumed pharmaceuticals in biosolid enriched soils and digested sludges is presented. Using a combination of pressurized liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, it was possible to detect all analytes in each sample type at the low-sub ng g(-1) level. Solid phase extraction efficiencies were compared for 6 different sorbent types and it was found that Waters Oasis HLB cartridges offered enhanced selectivities with 20 analytes showing final method recoveries >= 60% in both soils and digested sludges. The method was validated for linearity, range, precision and limits of detection in both sample matrices. All analytes were then determined in sludge enriched soils as well as the precursor thermally dried sludge fertilizer produced from a primary wastewater treatment plant. Levels of the antibacterial agent triclosan were found to exceed 20 mu g g(-1) in digested sludge and 5 mu g g(-1) in thermally dried sludge cake. Significant traces of carbamazepine and warfarin were also detected in the above samples.

AB Contamination of freshwater with micropollutants (MPs) is a growing concern worldwide. Even at very low concentrations, MPs can have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and possibly also on human health. Switzerland is one of the first countries to start implementing a national policy to reduce MPs in the effluents of municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). This paper estimates the benefits of upgrading STPs based on public's stated preferences. To assess public demand for the reduction of the environmental and health risks of MPs, we conducted a choice experiment in a national online survey. The results indicate that the average willingness to pay per household is CHF 100 (US$ 73) annually for reducing the potential environmental risk of MPs to a low level. These benefits, aggregated over households in the catchment of the STPs to be upgraded, generate a total annual economic value of CHF 155 million (US$ 113 million). This compares with estimated annual costs for upgrading 123 STPs of CHF 133 million (US$ 97 million) or CHF 86 (US$ 63) per household connected to these STPs. Hence, a cost benefit analysis justifies the investment decision from an economic point of view and supports the implementation of the national policy in the ongoing political discussion.

AB Membrane fouling is considered as a main drawback for MBR technology especially treating industrial wastewater. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of fouling in membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater with the addition of ferric hydroxide. Two identical lab-scale MBRs, namely, a control MBR (Co-MBR) and an enhanced MBR dosed with ferric hydroxide (Fe-MBR), were operated in parallel. The results demonstrate membrane fouling was retarded by 35% with the addition of iron. Further exploration of membrane fouling mechanisms showed iron addition resulted in increase in biomass floc size, enhancement of bacteria activity and reduction of dissolved organic concentration, especially carbohydrate, biopolymer and low molecular weight compounds concentrations in mixed liquor. There was also lower abundance of bacterial associated with biofilm formation in the Fe-MBR compared with the Co-MBR. These findings collectively contributed to the positive impacts on membrane fouling mitigation.

The combination of two technologiesbank infiltration and artificial rechargeare used for production of drinking water. The two-year monitoring of PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) at monthly intervals observed temporal changes in 81 substances in the source river and groundwater, and the efficacy of contamination removal depended on the treatment technology used. The results showed a very wide range of PPCPs discharged from the waste water treatment plant at Mlada Boleslav into the Jizera River at concentrations ranging from ng/L to g/L. Acesulfame and oxypurinol in concentrations exceeding 100 ng/L systematically occurred, and then a few tens of ng/L of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, primidone, and lamotrigine were regularly detected at the water outlet using the artificial recharge for production of drinking water. Bank infiltration was found more efficient in removing PPCP substances at the Karany locality where none of the monitored substances was systematically detected in the mixed sample.

AB The phototransformation of 18 organic micropollutants (OMPs) commonly detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents was examined attempting to explain their fate during UV disinfection in WWTPs. For this purpose, a lab-scale UV reactor (lamp emitting at 254 nm) was used to study the influence of the operational conditions (UV dose, temperature and water matrix) on OMPs abatement and disinfection efficiency. Chemical properties of OMPs and the quality of treated effluent were identified as key factors affecting the phototransformation rate of these compounds. Sampling campaigns were carried out at the inlet and outlet of UV systems of three WWTPs, and the results evidenced that only the most photosensitive compounds, such as sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac, are eliminated. Therefore, despite IN treatment is an effective technology to phototransform OMPs, the UV doses typically applied for disinfection (10-50 mJ/cm(2)) are not sufficient to remove them. Consequently, small modifications (increase of UV dose, use of catalysts) should be applied in WWTPs to enhance the abatement of OMPs in UV systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigates possible uptake and bioconcentration of different classes of pharmaceuticals residues (organic contaminants) in fish bile using a simplified analytical methodology based on solid phase microextration (SPME). The use of solid phase microextraction (SPME), as a simple analytical tool, to screen for target pharmaceuticals in fish bile samples was validated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) following short-term laboratory exposures to carbamazepine and fluoxetine. While fish bioconcentrated both fluoxetine and carbamazepine from exposure water, fluoxetine accumulated to a greater degree in bile than carbamazepine. Good agreement was obtained for both analytes in bile samples between SPME and traditional liquid (solvent) extraction approaches (R-2 > 0.99). The field application of SPME sampling was further demonstrated in fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), a small-bodied fish caged upstream and downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant where fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and sertraline were detected in fish bile at the downstream location. SPME is a promising analytical tool for investigating the bioconcentration of trace contaminants in fish bile, facilitating detection of trace environmental contaminants otherwise undetectable due to low concentrations in the environment and biological tissues as well as the complexity of the sample matrices.

AB The present work aimed to evaluate the capacity of constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove three emerging organic contaminants with different physicochemical properties: caffeine (CAF), oxybenzone (MBPh), and triclosan (TCS). The simulated CWs were set up with a matrix of light expanded clay aggregates (LECA) and planted with Spartina maritima, a salt marsh plant. Controlled experiments were carried out in microcosms using deionized water and wastewater collected at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), with different contaminant mass ranges, for 3, 7, and 14 days. The effects of variables were tested isolatedly and together (LECA and/or S. maritima). The presence of LECA and/or S. maritima has shown higher removal (around 61-97%) of lipophilic compounds (MBPh and TCS) than the hydrophilic compound (CAF; around 19-85%). This was attributed to the fact that hydrophilic compounds are dissolved in the water column, whereas the lipophilic ones suffer sorption processes promoting their removal by plant roots and/or LECA. In the control (only wastewater), a decrease in the three contaminant levels was observed. Adsorption and bio/rhizoremediation are the strongest hypothesis to explain the decrease in contaminants in the tested conditions.

AB This study presents the influence of the addition of additives such as activated carbon, carbon tetra chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium dichromate on ultrasonic reduction of pharmaceutical wastewater chemical oxygen demand (COD) under laboratory conditions. The addition of activated carbon increased the % COD reduction whereas the combined addition of activated carbon and H2O2/CCl4/K2Cr2O7 was found to show higher reduction. Among the various combinations investigated, the combined addition of activated carbon and CCl4 was found to be the best combination. However, the environmental and health problems associated with these chemicals limit the applicability of the process in an industrial level. Further investigation with this system showed that the initial pH and initial COD have significant influence on the removal rate. The data obtained were fitted with first order and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models. The values of the rate constants obtained indicated that the pharmaceutical wastewater can be treated efficiently by the proposed methods.

AB Production of sustainable clean energy can be achieved by co-pyrolysis of agricultural residues and wastewater sludge. Herein, non-additive thermal behaviour of co-pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge and ginkgo biloba leaf residues was investigated. Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis was not obvious at elevated temperatures. Further, kinetics of co-pyrolysis was studied by fitting Coats-Redfern integration method to thermogravimetric (TG) curve. The change of heat and mass transfer in the reactor caused the change of dynamic parameters. Moreover, hybrid particle swarm optimization and gradient boosting decision tree (PSO-GBDT) algorithm was designed to boost the energy production at full-scale pyrolysis plant by monitoring TG curves. PSO-GBDT model well predicts mass loss rate of the mixture at different heating rates confirming that co-pyrolysis of PS and GBLR can results in high energy production by increasing PS pyrolysis. Designing PSO-GBDT model help to reduced waste production by resourceful treatment of waste in to energy.

AB Hospital wastewater is a major source of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), which are not all removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. White rot fungi can degrade PhACs, but their application has been limited to non-sterile conditions due to the competition with other microorganisms for growth. In this study, immobilization of Trametes versicolor on different lignocellulosic supports was studied as strategy to ensure fungal survival under continuous treatment conditions. A fluidized bed reactor and a trickling packed-bed reactor with T. versicolor immobilized on pallet wood were employed for the removal of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen. Best results were obtained with the trickling packed-bed reactor, which operated for 49 days with high removal values in real hospital wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concern is growing over contamination of the environment with artificial sweeteners (ASWs) because of their widespread existence in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To evaluate ASWs removal and the effect on activated sludge, acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), cyclamate (CYC) and saccharin (SAC) were introduced individually or in mixture to sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) in environmentally relevant concentrations (100 ppb) for 100 days. Comparisons between ACE removal in a full-scale WWTP and in lab-scale SBRs were conducted. Results showed that CYC and SAC were completely removed, whereas SUC was persistent. However, ACE removal in lab-scale SBRs was significantly greater than in the full-scale WWTP. In SBRs, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal appeared unchanged after adding ASWs (p > 0.05). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) declined significantly (p < 0.05). The mixed ASWs had more evident effects than the individual ASWs. Microbial community analyses revealed that Proteobacteria decreased obviously, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria were enriched with the addition of ASWs. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated ACE had a greater impact on activated sludge than the other ASWs.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are commonly considered as the main source of pharmaceuticals in surface waters. Here, however, we show that an open-air festival, attracting approximately 10 000 visitors per year at the shores of River Fyris upstream of Uppsala WWTP, can temporarily result in a higher pharmaceutical input into the river water than the WWTP. Studying the influence of Uppsala Reggae festival on the occurrence of ten commonly used acidic and basic pharmaceuticals upstream, in the effluent, and downstream of the Uppsala WWTP, we found that occasional heavy rainfalls during the festival in 2008 severely increased the mass flows of all pharmaceuticals at the WWTP upstream site. Also, strong increases in ammonium (210-fold), nitrate (21-fold), and total nitrogen (21-fold) mass flows were observed. The pharmaceutical mass flows at the upstream site were up to 3.4 times higher than those observed in the WWTP effluent. In contrast, in 2009, the festival was not accompanied with rainfalls and no major additional input of pharmaceuticals and nitrogen was observed. The findings of this study give new insights into risk assessments and are relevant for monitoring programmes.

AB Acetophenone effluent is found in a variety of waste streams from manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and dyes. Acetophenone presents hazards to the health of human and aquatic animals. A process integrating catalytic intense pulsed light (cIPL) with microalgae Tribonema sp. cultivation was proposed and investigated for decontamination of acetophenone rich wastewater. The results showed that the acetophenone level was degraded from 100 to 20 mg/L after 40 min-cIPL treatment. A 20 to 40 min treatment lower the toxic acetophenone to levels permitting the growth of Tribonema sp. The highest biomass productivity (up to 0.094 g/L/d) was achieved after the 40 min-cIPL treatment. In addition, higher lipid content and premium fatty acid (C16:1) were found with the 40-min cIPL treatment. Overall, this combined process is efficient for toxic pollutant removal and nutrient recovery in wastewater.

AB The main recent advances in photo-Fenton oxidation treatment for recalcitrant wastewaters have been reviewed. Biodegradable intermediates and mineralized pollutants are obtained from recalcitrant compounds when this oxidation technology is employed in wastewater. However, the cost of the technology is one of the main limitations. Several strategies, such as new nanotechnologies, heterogeneous catalysts or chelating agents have been used to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process. Moreover, applying solar energy cost can be reduced integrating biological treatments in the oxidation process. Direct UV photolysis is able to degrade pollutants (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, endocrine-disrupting compounds, and herbicides) in water. In this scenery, photo-Fenton is presented as an attractive and very effective alternative for the removal of recalcitrant compounds and emerging contaminants present in wastewater.

AB TiO2/HNTs were modified by metal ions with the impregnation method. The as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results demonstrated that TiO2/HNTs were successfully synthesized, and anatase TiO2 was formed after calcination. Moreover, after modification, the as-prepared TiO2/HNTs still kept crystalline structure. Furthermore, a red-shift was obviously observed fromUV-vis DRS, and the band gap energy was narrowed. ICP-AES proved that compared with TiO2/HNTs, metal ions were existed in metal ion@TiO2/HNTs. The photocatalytic activity was studied by the degradation of antibiotics aqueous solution under the visible light irradiation. The results showed that Fe3+@TiO2/HNTs had the strong ability to degrade tetracycline, and the optimum adding concentration of Fe3+ was 0.2 g/L. In addition, the degradation effect of tetracycline was better. The photodegradation rate of 40 mg L-1 tetracycline simulated wastewater could reach 76.54%. The binary system was also investigated, which showed that the degradation rate of co-doped TiO2/HNTs was lower than Fe3+@TiO2/HNTs.

AB Twelve selected pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, analgesics, antiepileptics and lipid regulators were analysed and detected in water samples collected from 18 sampling sections along the three main urban rivers in Yangpu District of Shanghai, China during four sampling campaigns. Besides, algal growth inhibition test was conducted to preliminarily assess the eco-toxicology induced by the target pharmaceuticals in the rivers. Mean levels for most of target compounds were generally below 100 ng/L at sampling sections, with the exception of caffeine and paracetamol presenting considerably high concentration. The detected pharmaceuticals in the urban rivers ranged from <LOQ for propranolol to 8571 ng/L for caffeine. Qiujiang River could be regarded as the most polluted according to total detected pharmaceutical concentrations. The target pharmaceuticals varied and fluctuated irregularly from the upstreams to the downstreams of the three rivers, indicating the wastewater inputs from non-point sources and their individual different characteristics of transference and transportation. Preliminary eco-toxicological risk assessment showed that the presence of azithromycin, clarithromycin and caffeine may present an ecotoxicological risk in the urban rivers. For other tested pharmaceuticals the inhibition effects of single substances in the urban aquatic environment, based on the algae inhibition tests, were very imperceptible.

AB Pharmaceuticals or their metabolites are partially excreted with urine or faeces ending up in raw sewage. Many of these substances are not biodegradable and their presence in influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants may cause adverse effects to sensitive biological processes such as nitrification, while on the other hand, they may go through the activated sludge process unreacted. The second step of nitrification, i.e. oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is particularly sensitive. Inhibition of this step under uncontrolled conditions may lead to accumulation of nitrite nitrogen in the plant effluent, a form of nitrogen which is particularly toxic. The effects caused by the presence of seven different pharmaceuticals to a culture of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from activated sludge are presented. These pharmaceuticals were ofloxacin, propranolol, clofibrate, triclosan, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole. Different effects were observed for each of the pharmaceuticals tested in this study. In the cases of ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole significant inhibition was observed. Triclosan presented a substantial inhibitory effect on the substrate (nitrite) reduction rate. The long-term effect of triclosan on nitrite oxidizers was also examined in a CSTR reactor and conclusions were drawn regarding the reversibility of the inhibition caused by this compound.

AB Organic emerging micropollutants are persistent during the biological process used in treatment plants and have the tendency to accumulate in the sludge. Since a common method of final sludge disposal is the land application, there are potential risks associated with the presence of contaminants within the sludge. In this work, the removal efficiency of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, namely bisphenol A, nonylphenol and triclosan from sludge was investigated using ozonation and electrooxidation using boron-doped diamond electrodes. Both procedures were studied to determine the optimal conditions (pH, current density and ozone flow) for removing these chemicals in an hour. With the obtained conditions, a coupled system ozonation-electrooxidation was used with the goal to have better pollutant elimination. Results indicate that these compounds could be effectively removed by the coupled system; the diminutions were Bisphenol A 86%, nonylphenol 68% and triclosan 67%. Also improvements in the quality of aqueous phase were obtained, and for instance, the chemical oxygen demand, color and turbidity, were abated in 62, 61 and 66%, respectively. Moreover, an additional advantage of the coupled system is the absence of any secondary pollution.

AB Siloxane-based compounds are widely used in personal care, pharmaceutical and household products as well as in industrial applications. Among the wide variety of these chemicals, special attention has been given to volatile methylsiloxanes (VMSs). These compounds have been extensively detected in several environmental compartments, as they are not effectively removed from wastewater and may migrate through different matrices and being lipophilic, bioaccumulate and biomagnify in living organisms. In this work, a prioritisation methodology for several VMSs in different environmental matrices was applied, estimating a hazard quotient by combining exposure evaluation through measured or predicted environmental concentrations (MEC or PEC) and effects using ecotoxicity data to establish no effect concentrations (PNEC).VMSs show quite different hazard potentials in the environment: for linear VMSs it is not considerable, while for cyclic VMSs the hazard is disperse. D4 and D5 may have adverse effects in water, as well as D5 and D6 in sediments. This first multi-matrix approach for the prioritisation of VMSs sets the ground for more accurate studies in the future, provided that more field-based data are reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nine selected antibiotics in the Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong and the Pearl River at Guangzhou, South China, were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the concentrations of antibiotics were mainly below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in the marine water of Victoria Harbour. However, except for amoxicillin, all of the antibiotics were detected in the Pearl River during high and low water seasons with the median concentrations ranging from 11 to 67 ng/L, and from 66 to 460 ng/L, respectively; and the concentrations in early spring were about 2-15 times higher than that in summer with clearer diurnal variations. It was suggested that the concentrations of antibiotics in the high water season were more affected by wastewater production cycles due to quick refreshing rate, while those in the low water season may be more sensitive to the water column dynamics controlled by tidal processes in the river.

AB The biodegradability of different wastewater samples originated from the industrial production of three pharmaceuticals (naproxen, acyclovir, and nalidixic acid) was performed through the standard Zahn-Wellens test. Moreover, the wastewater composition before and during the test was evaluated in terms of parent compounds and main metabolites by LC/MS, and the biodegradability of the parent compounds was also assessed by performing extra Zahn-Wellens tests on synthetic solutions. The results, besides showing the relatively good biodegradability of acyclovir and naproxen, evidenced the masking role of the organic matrices, especially in the case of nalidixic acid. The latter compound showed to be recalcitrant and persistent, despite the apparently good performance of the Zahn-Wellens test. Deeper evaluation evidenced that the biodegradation of high concentrations of organic solvents and other biodegradable compound tended to "hide" the lack of removal of the target compound.

AB The pre-treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by Fenton oxidation with zero-valent iron (ZVI) and hydrogen peroxide was investigated to improve the degradation of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater. The influence of different crucial parameters such as the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration, the ZVI concentration and the capacity of the ZVI/H2O2 system to treat different organic loading have been evaluated. The optimal conditions for degradation led to TOC reductions of up to 80% in only 1 h of treatment. This degree of organic mineralization was reached by using moderate loadings of ZVI and hydrogen peroxide (ZVI/TOC weight and H2O2/TOC molar ratios of 12 and 3.2, respectively). Moreover, the use of waste-metallic iron shavings in terms of TOC removal compared to commercial ZVI powder may be a promising and cheaper development. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications, including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from wastewater. In this work, we measured the removal efficiency of two wastewater treatment processes: an activated-sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs). The latter was tested using two different configurations. In the first one, HRAPs were placed after an UASB reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients. In the second, the UASB reactor was disconnected so the HRAPs were directly fed with pretreated wastewater. Additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation (DAF). The performances of both configurations (UASB-HRAP and HRAP-DAF) were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sixty-four out of 81 target PhACs were detected in the influent of the WWTP, at an average concentration of 223 mu g L-1, whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional (14 mu g L-1) and non-conventional (17 mu g L-1) effluents. Average removal efficiencies were similar (94 vs. 92%) for both treatment lines when comparing total PhACs concentrations. The compositional patterns of the resulting effluents, however, were not, suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered. Highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non conventional effluent (>1 mu g L-1), denoting lower removal than in the conventional line. On the other hand, elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) was between 15 and 50% higher using HRAPs. Overall, the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing PhACs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional WWTP5. This, combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients, shows the potential of HRAP technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative (or addition as tertiary treatment) to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge.

AB Pharmaceuticals have become "persistent" pollutants in the aquatic environment, due to theft wide usage in daily life and their continuous release into the aquatic environment. Hence, prioritization and ranking lists are required to screen for target compounds as part of risk assessments. A ranking system based on three criteria, such as occurrence, exposure potential and ecological effects, was developed in this study for specific application to China. A total of 100 pharmaceuticals were selected as candidates based on the ranking system and available consumption data. These pharmaceuticals have been previously reported by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in China. 13 pharmaceuticals were classified as priority pharmaceuticals, among which diclofenac, erythromycin, and penicillin G were highly prioritized. Due to their abuse, antibiotics contributed a majority to the priority pharmaceuticals among all therapeutic classes, indicating that antibiotics should be considered based on their behaviors in WWTPs. The pharmaceuticals ranking list achieved good applicability and will help to establish a focus for future monitoring and management of pharmaceuticals. It will also provide an important basis for both ecological risk assessment and pollution control of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, especially in rivers and reservoirs, is receiving growing attention in South Korea because reservoirs are an important source of drinking water in this country. Seasonal changes in the abundance of 11 ARGs and a mobile genetic element (int1) in two reservoirs in South Korea, located near drinking water treatment plants in Cheonan and Cheongju cities, were monitored for 6 mo. In these drinking water sources, total ARG concentrations reached 2.5 x 10(7) copies mL(-1), which is one order of magnitude higher than in influents of some wastewater treatment plants in South Korea. During the sampling periods in August, October, and November 2016 and January 2017, sulfonamides (sul1), beta-lactam antibiotics (bla(TEM)), and tetracycline (tetA) resistance genes were the most abundant genes at the two sites. The ARG abundance consistently increased in January relative to 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) counts. General stress responses to oxidative stress and other environmental factors associated with the cold season could be significant drivers of ARG horizontal gene transfer in the environment. Accordingly, removal of ARGs as a key step in water treatment warrants more attention.

AB An innovative plant configuration based in an UASB reactor coupled to a hybrid aerobic membrane bioreactor designed for sustainable treatment of municipal wastewater at ambient temperatures and low hydraulic retention time was studied in terms of organic micropollutants (OMPs) removal. OMPs removal mechanisms, as well as the potential influence of biomass activity and physical conformation were assessed. Throughout all periods of operation (150 days) high organic matter removals were maintained (>95%) and, regarding OMPs removal, this innovative system has shown to be more efficient than conventional technologies for those OMPs which are prone to be biotransformed under anaerobic conditions. For instance, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have both shown to be biodegradable under anaerobic conditions with similar efficiencies (removal efficiencies above 84%). OMPs main removal mechanism was found to be biotransformation, except in the case of musk fragrances which showed medium sorption onto sludge.

AB The behavior of pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic ecosystems is not well defined. In order to determine spatial and temporal variations in concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the Tennessee River, water samples were collected from multiple points along the river and at the inflow of major tributaries. Sampling structure was designed to investigate trends between surface and subsurface samples, seasonal trends (winter, spring, summer, and fall), the direct influence of sewage treatment plants (upstream versus downstream), and the effect of downstream distance on pharmaceutical concentrations. All samples were quantified via solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This method yielded reproducible quantitation at low parts per trillion (ng L(-1)) levels for all 14 analytes (acetaminophen, atorvastatin, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, fluoxetine, levofloxacin. lovastatin, norfluoxetine, ranitidine, sertraline, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim). Correlation analyses (depth. distance) and repeated-measures ANOVAs (season, sewage treatment plant proximity) were used to determine statistically significant trends for frequently detected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole). Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were found to vary by season in subsurface samples: spring exhibited the highest concentrations. Carbamazepine varied in proximity to sewage treatment plant outfall with subsurface samples yielding greater concentrations downstream than upstream. In addition, individual pharmaceuticals displayed positive correlation between surface and subsurface samples and negative correlation with downstream distance from the headwaters.

AB An advanced water recycling demonstration plant was employed to investigate the effectiveness of a number of treatment technologies in the removal of some residuals of commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals as well as natural and synthetic hormones found in sewage. Analysis of targeted compounds was carried out by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Initial tests were undertaken to determine the background concentrations of the analytes during various stages of treatment. Subsequent tests, undertaken by spiking with standard solutions of the target compounds provided further information on the removal efficiencies of some selected treatment modules. The results of the study indicate that while ozonation, microfiltration and nanofiltration were partially effective, treatment by reverse osmosis was the most universally successful in the removal of the target residuals. While significantly more data is required for a full evaluation, this initial investigation suggests that reverse osmosis may be an effective means of removing a wider range of pharmaceutically active residuals and hormones from treated sewage.

TI Modeling the fate and human health impacts of pharmaceuticals and

   agriculture

DE Reclaimed wastewater; PPCPs; Human dietary exposure; Biotransfer
AB Wastewater reclamation and reuse for agriculture have attracted a great deal of interest, due to water stress caused by rapid increase in human population and agricultural water demand as well as climate change. However, the application of treated wastewater for irrigation can lead to the accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the agricultural crops, grazing animals, and consequently to human dietary exposure. In this study, a model was developed to simulate the fate of five PPCPs; triclosan (TCS), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NPX), gemfibrozil (GFB), and fluoxetine (FXT) during wastewater reuse for agriculture, and potential human dietary exposure and health risk. In a reclaimed wastewater-irrigated grazing farm growing alfalfa, it took 100-535 days for PPCPs to achieve the steady-state concentrations of 1.43 x 10(-6), 4.73 x 10(-5), 1.17 x 10(-6), 1.53 x 10(-5), and 7.38 x 10(-6) mg/ kg for TCS, CBZ, NPX, GFB, and FXT in soils, respectively. The accumulated concentration of PPCPs in the plant (alfalfa) and grazing animals (beef) ranged 2.86 x 10(-7) - 4.02 x 10(-3) and 4.39 x 10(-15) 6.27 x 10(-7) mg/kg, respectively. Human dietary exposure to these compounds through beef consumption was calculated to be 1.67 x 10(-18) - 1.74 x 10(-10) mg/kg bodyweight/d, much lower than the acceptable daily intake (ADI). Similar results were obtained for atypical' reclaimed wastewater irrigated farm based on the typical setup using our model. Screening analysis showed that PPCPs with relatively high LogD value and lower ratios of degradation rate (in soils) to plant uptake have a greater potential to be transferred to humans and cause potential health risks. We established a modeling method for evaluating the fate and human health effects of PPCPs in reclaimed wastewater reuse for the agricultural system and developed an index for screening PPCPs with high potential to accumulate in agricultural products. The model and findings are valuable for managing water reuse for irrigation and mitigating the harmful effects of PPCPs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of antibiotics in water resources has been disturbing news for the stakeholders who are responsible for public health and the drinking water supply. In many cases, biological wastewater treatment plants are the final opportunity in the water cycle to trap these substances. The sensitivity of activated sludge bacteria to erythromycin, a macrolide widely used in human medicine was investigated in batch toxicity tests using a concentration range of 1-300 mg L-1. Erythromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, has been found to significantly inhibit ammonification, nitritation and nitratation at concentrations higher than 20 mg L-1. The degree of inhibition increased with greater concentrations of the antibiotic. Exposure to erythromycin also clearly affected heterotrophs, particularly filamentous bacteria, causing floc disintegration and breakage of filaments. Cell lysis was observed with the concomitant release of organic nitrogen (intracellular proteins) and soluble COD. Although erythromycin exhibits properties of a surfactant, this characteristic alone cannot explain the damage to heterotrophs: the effects from erythromycin were greater than those of Tween 80, a commonly used surfactant. Floc disruption can lead to the release of isolated bacteria, and possibly antibiotic resistance genes, into the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rotating biological contactors (RBC) are effective for treating wastewater, while they are rarely reported to be used for treating antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater (APW). The current study investigates treatment of APW using an RBC. The effects of influent concentration, number of stages, and temperature on the remediation of APW were studied. The results indicated, even at low ambient temperature, 45% COD and 40% NH4+-N removal efficiencies. Moreover, the BOD5 removal efficiency was 85%. Microscopic observations illustrated that there were various active microorganisms displayed in the biofilms and their distribution changed from stage to stage. Compared with activated sludge, the biofilms in this study have higher content of dry matter and are easier to dehydrate and settle. Compared with current commercial incineration processes or advanced oxidation processes, RBC can greatly reduce the treatment cost. This research shows RBC is effective for such an inherently biorecalcitrant wastewater even at low ambient temperature.

Total organic matter removal, measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), was on average over 99%. Regarding nutrients, 99% of the initial ammonia and 40% of phosphorous were eliminated. The industrial wastewater was spiked with four target corticosteroids at a final concentration of 100 mu g L-1 in order to assess their elimination. Chemical analysis of MBR effluent revealed that all corticosteroids were removed at percentages higher than 93% in all the cases. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC) is a promising step to extend existing treatment trains in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and, thus, to reduce the concentration of micropollutants (MPs) (e.g. pharmaceuticals) in wastewater. It is common practice to use characteristic numbers when choosing GAC for a specific application. In this study, characteristic numbers were correlated for five different GACs, with measured adsorption capacities of these carbons for three pharmaceutical MPs (carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole) and dissolved organic carbon of a WWTP effluent. The adsorption capacities were measured using rapid small scale column tests. Density of GAC showed the highest correlation to adsorption of MP. All other characteristic numbers (iodine number, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface and methylene blue titre) are not suitable markers for choosing an appropriate activated carbon product for the elimination of MPs from municipal wastewater.

AB We report on the development of an electrochemical sensor based on electrodepositing zinc oxide on multiwalled carbon nanotube-modified glassy carbon electrode for the detection of caffeine in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. The measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). DPV measurements showed a linear relationship between oxidation peak current and concentration of caffeine in 0.1M HClO4 (pH 1.0) over the concentration range 0.00388-4.85mg/L and a detection limit of 0.00194mg/L. The diffusion coefficient and Langmuir adsorption constant for caffeine were calculated to be 3.25x10(-6)cm(2)s(-1) and 1.10x10(3)M(-1), respectively. The sensor showed satisfactory results when applied to the detection of caffeine in wastewater effluents.

AB In this work, a sensitive and highly selective method was developed and validated to study the degradation of two antibiotic compounds (ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP)), spiked in secondary treated domestic effluents, by the solar Fenton process. Three different chromatographic columns were tested on a ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) instrument working in the electrospray ionization (ESI) mode with twelve combinations of eluting solvents. Samples were enriched prior to the analysis by solid phase extraction using the hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) reversed phase polymeric sorbent. The method was optimized and showed very good performance characteristics and was successfully applied to study the degradation kinetics of the selected antibiotics during the solar Fenton process applied. The degradation was found to follow a pseudo first-order kinetics for both compounds at initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 with k = 0.0345 min(-1) for OFX and k = 0.0768 min(-1) for TMP, whereas the complete removal was achieved after 120 min of treatment for both compounds.

AB The WFD is an overarching piece of legislation that aims to harmonize existing European water policy; since 2000 it requires managing the river basins so that the quality and quantity of water does not affect the ecological services and to promote sustainable water use of any specific water body. Nevertheless the goals of other directives, such as drinking water, bathing water and urban wastewater treatment (UWWT), are not yet harmonised mainly concerning microbiological and PS/PSR/PHS contamination. Great challenges are due to emerging contaminants especially the technical improvement and harmonisation for risk identification and risk assessment: for biological effects and for chemical analysis and, finally integrate this knowledge to preserve the "good status". The methodologies implemented have as aim the identification of acceptable or unacceptable risks. This identification provides the basis for the regulatory decisions, which follow from the risk assessment. After priority setting the UWWT needs to be adjusted and existing or new treatment options should comply with the requirements of the different directives. This will be another step on the way to reach the targets given in EU water legislation and in the achievements of millennium development goals.

AB The efficiency of a microwave-assisted Fenton-like process using special supported catalysts was evaluated using total organic carbon (TOC) removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. No acidification was required. The highest level of TOC removal efficiency from wastewater achieved was 65.88%. Moreover, the maximum number of consecutive uses with high activity was four. Under optimal conditions, the influent value of BOD5/COD was 0.25, and the effluent value of BOD5/COD was elevated to 0.40. In addition, colour was completely removed. This efficiency was compared with the same MW-Fenton-like process using common supported catalysts, where the highest achieved TOC removal efficiency from wastewater was 39.25%, the colour of the wastewater decreased from 50 to 20, and the value of BOD5/COD was elevated from 0.25 to 0.34. The maximum number of consecutive high activity uses was two. This advanced performance was attributed to no presence of copper carbonate or cerium carbonate on the surface of special supported catalysts. The preparation method for these catalysts combined the merits of the isometric impregnation method with some new improvements. Its advantages include high-efficiency performance, short preparation time, low reagent usage (cupric nitrate 3.6 g, cerium nitrate 1.2 g, ammonia 1 mL), and reusability. The properties of the catalyst with the most efficient performance were characterized by determining surface particle size, the relative amount of active components and promoters, and the stable crystal form of the active components.

AB Sewage sludge has been used as fertilizer for agricultural land over a long time. This is part of a sustainable practice utilizing and recycling the macronutrients back to land. During the last decades, questions have been raised concerning the risks related to heavy metals and xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) present in the sludge. Application on land used for agriculture is, therefore, not socially acceptable in some countries, e.g., Sweden. In this study, literature reviews showed that 541 XOCs potentially could be present in sewage sludge due to their presence in e.g. construction materials, pharmaceuticals, personal care products etc. 192 compounds have been quantified in sewage sludge, which indicate that, although many XOCs have been measured in sludge, there are potentially a vast number of compounds present that have not been analyzed for yet. In a hazard identification of the quantified compounds using their inherent properties and environmental fate it was shown that 99 XOCs could be classified as being hazardous with regard to the solid phase and 23 were found to be priority pollutants in the subsequent hazard assessment. The final selected priority pollutants can act as indicators when assessing sludge quality. They were compared with European legislations and discussed in regard for pointing out the need for mitigation such as substitution. Furthermore, the potential need for implementation of sludge treatment trains in order to meet the society's needs was addressed.

AB Pharmaceuticals ate active substances found in sewage effluents and can :negatively impact, aquatic systems even at low concentrations. A fraction of these chemicals can be attached onto suspended solids and end up in sediments. This research shows concentrations of a wide group of pharmaceuticals in Sediments from an urban estuarine setting (Jamaica Bay, New York). Highest concentrations (>75 ng g(-1)) were measured in surface sediments from the inner part of the bay, directly affected by sewage discharges and where water circulation is :more restricted. Only 16 but of 61 target compounds were detected, and those positively charged (e.g., metoprolol) and/or highly hydrophobic (e.g., tamoxifen) were predominant Their sediment-pore water partition coefficients were also calculated far the first time and were in a range between 11 and 2.041 L/kg depending on the compound. Analysis. Of dated sediment cores revealed that pharmaceuticals were well preserved along the sedimentary column, a highly reducing environment. There was an increase in the concentration of most target compounds over the last five decades correlated with the increase in their usage, with some exceptions such as sulfamethazine (now used only for veterinary purposes). Thus, overall concentration of pharmaceuticals in sediment cores showed a doubling time of 9.2 years. Vertical distribution profiles for selected compounds also allowed reconstructing the history of contamination at Jamaica Bay by pharmaceuticals. The use of some of these chemicals as sewage molecular markers was also investigated.

AB To assess the environmental fate and risks of pharmaceuticals, the determination of their distributions between sediment and water is crucial as a controlling process. In this paper, the concentrations of 9 selected pharmaceuticals were determined in water and sediment samples from the River Medway, Kent, UK between December 2009 and December 2010. In the water phase, there was a spatial variation of concentration with the highest concentrations being detected in the sewage outfall, indicating it being an important point source in the river. In terms of seasonal variations, the highest concentrations (13-878 ng L-1) were detected in June 2010. In the surface sediment phase, the highest concentrations (5.3-33.6 ng g(-1) dry weight) were observed at the sewage outfall, although in February 2010 the highest concentrations were detected downstream of the sewage outfall indicating a delayed response in sediment accumulation of pharmaceuticals in relation to the water phase. The partition coefficient of pharmaceuticals between surface sediment and water was variable, reflecting a dynamic process of sediment-water interaction and the varying nature of sediments. Overall the partition coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in suspended sediment concentration. The organic carbon normalized partition coefficient of the pharmaceuticals was shown to be positively related to their molecular weight (MW), suggesting that sediment-water interactions were partly a partition process favoring large molecules.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are a ubiquitous source of contamination whose impacts on fish and other aquatic organisms span across multiple levels of biological organization. Despite this, few studies have addressed the impacts of WWTP effluents on fish communities, especially during the winter-a season seldom studied. Here, we assessed the impacts of wastewater on fish community compositions and various water quality parameters during the summer and winter along two effluent gradients in Hamilton Harbour, an International Joint Commission Area of Concern in Hamilton, Canada. We found that fish abundance, species richness, and species diversity were generally highest in sites closest to the WWTP outfalls, but only significantly so in the winter. Fish community compositions differed greatly along the effluent gradients, with sites closest and farthest from the outfalls being the most dissimilar. Furthermore, the concentrations of numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the final treated effluent were highest during the winter. Water quality of sites closer to the outfalls was poorer than at sites farther away, especially during the winter. We also demonstrated that WWTPs can significantly alter the thermal profile of effluent-receiving environments, increasing temperature by as much as similar to 9 degrees C during the winter. Our results suggest that wastewater plumes may act as ecological traps in winter, whereby fish are attracted to the favourable temperatures near WWTPs and are thus exposed to higher concentrations of CECs. This study highlights the importance of winter research as a key predictor in further understanding the impacts of wastewater contamination in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment is used by 20% of residences in the United States. The ability of these systems, specifically soil treatment units (STUs), to attenuate trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) is not well understood. TOrCs released by STUs pose a potential risk to downstream groundwater and hydraulically-connected surface water that may be used as a drinking water source. A series of bench-scale experiments were conducted using sand columns to represent STUs and to evaluate the efficacy of TOrC attenuation as a function of hydraulic loading rate (1, 4, 8, 12, and 30 cm/day). Each hydraulic loading rate was examined using triplicate experimental columns. Columns were initially seeded with raw wastewater to establish a microbial community, after which they were fed with synthetic wastewater and spiked with 17 TOrCs, in four equal doses per day, to provide a consistent influent water quality. After an initial start-up phase, effluent from all columns consistently demonstrated >90% reductions in dissolved organic carbon and nearly complete (>85%) oxidation of ammonia to nitrate, comparable to the performance of field STUs. The results of this study suggest STUs are capable of attenuating many TOrCs present in domestic wastewater, but attenuation is compound-specific. A subset of TOrCs exhibited an inverse relationship with hydraulic loading rate and attenuation efficiency. Atenolol, cimetidine, and TCPP were more effectively attenuated over time in each experiment, suggesting that the microbial community evolved to a stage where these TOrCs were more effectively biotransformed. Aerobic conditions as compared to anaerobic conditions resulted in more efficient attenuation of acetaminophen and cimetidine. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Distinguishing municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) from other industrial effluents or through an urbanized watershed can be challenging. In complex receiving environments, linking environmental responses to specific compounds or effluents is not always straight forward. In order to characterize the inherent complexity of tracing MWWE in aquatic systems influenced by multiple stressors, a proposed multi-tracer suite is intended to highlight areas of potential biological concern. Characterization and quantification of effluent exposure to aquatic biota in this manner is essential to shape policies intended to encourage wastewater infrastructure development (i.e. treatment plant upgrade) and broader environmental management. This paper describes the use of a comprehensive suite of tracers that includes isotopes in support of a core surveillance program, demonstrating its effectiveness both empirically and with respect to diagnostic value contributed to monitoring programs.

AB The sonophotocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical industry wastewater was studied with a TiO2 slurry mode process with UV 125 W medium-pressure mercury lamp coupled with ultrasound (100 W, 33 +/- 3 kHz). The degradation of wastewater was investigated in terms of reduction in COD that confirmed the apparent first- order degradation kinetics. The rate constant was greatly affected by catalyst dose, variation in pH, and concentration of oxidant (H2O2).The catalyst concentration was optimized at 1.0 g L-1, pH at 4, and the oxidant concentration at 0.075 g L-1. The first-order rate constants obtained from coupled sonophotocatalysis were two-folds than those obtained from photocatalysis and approximately ten-folds than sonolysis. The COD reduction follows the trend, sonophotocatalysis > photocatalysis > sonocatalytic > sonolysis. The study demonstrates better efficiency of coupled sonophotocatalysis over independent treatment processes.

AB In this study, an analytical methods for determination of antidepressants including (diazepam (DZP), lorazepam (LZP), carbamazepine (CBZ), fluoxetine (FLU)) was developed. The concentration of antidepressants was monitored in Konya Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant influent and effluent samples for one years. Environmental risk assessment was performed with detected concentration with treatment plant effluent wastewater by hazard quotient (HQ) methods. Oasis HLB cartridges with SPE system was used for extraction of wastewater samples. The effect of sample volume and pH, different analyte concentration, pretreatment and matrix on efficiency of cartridges were optimized. Quantitative analyses of the target compounds were performed by LC/MS-MS system. Recoveries of antidepressant compounds from fortified wastewater were over 87% for three different fortification levels. The limits of detection were determined between 0.006 and 0.118 ng l(-1). CBZ, FLU and LZP concentration in influent varied from 6.3 to 135.6 ng l(-1), <dl to 2.6 ng l(-1), <dl to 4.8 ng l(-1), respectively, while DZP was not detected. CBZ, DZP, FLU and LZP concentrations in the effluent was determined as <dl-245.1 ng l(-1), <dl-0.21 ng l(-1), <dl-2.7 ng l(-1), <dl-2.2 ng l(-1), respectively. Antidepressants were generally removed in January, February, and August. The high removal was determined for CBZ compounds as % 100 at January. The low removal was determined for FLU compounds as % 2.4 at January.
   While the HQ values for DZP, LZP, CBZ were determined below 0.1 which means insignificant risk to aquatic organisms, HQ values for FLU determined above 0.1 which means low risk to aquatic organism

AB The City of Phoenix, Arizona is investigating various disinfection technologies for its 91st Avenue wastewater treatment facility: (1) ultraviolet light (UV), (2) ozone, (3) UV/hydrogen pet-oxide, (4) ozone/hydrogen peroxide, (5) and UV/ozone. lit addition to providing disinfection, the City would like to consider the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and personal and pharmaceutical care products (PPCPs) in the treatment technology evaluation. To identify the most economical disinfection system, the evaluation included bench-scale testing of the technologies considered and a year-long water quality monitoring study. This paper presents the results of the benchscale analyses and estimated capital and O&M costs.

AB Pharmaceutical concentration data for Indian surface waters are currently scarce. Sewage often enters Indian rivers without prior treatment, and so previously reported environmental concentrations from regions with routinely implemented sewage treatment cannot simply be used to predict concentrations in Indian surface water. Improved knowledge of pharmaceutical concentrations in Indian waters would enable determination of potential risks posed to aquatic wildlife and human health in this region. The concentrations of five common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid) were determined in surface waters from 27 locations of the Kaveri, Vellar, and Tamiraparani Rivers in southern India. The samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by GC-MS. The measured concentrations of four of the five drugs in this reconnaissance were relatively similar to those reported elsewhere (ND-200 ng/l); however, acetylsalicylic acid, the most readily degradable of the investigated drugs, was found at all sites and at considerably higher concentrations (up to 660 ng/l) than reported in European surface waters. This is the first report on the occurrence of NSAIDs in Indian rivers. The finding of elevated concentrations of acetylsalicylic acid is most likely a result of direct discharges of untreated sewage. Therefore, readily degradable pharmaceuticals may present larger concern in regions without consistent sewage treatment. Based on measured environmental concentrations, the risks of direct toxicity to aquatic wildlife and of humans consuming the water are discussed.

AB Carbonyl reductase/20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CR/20 beta-HSD) serves both as a key enzyme in the gonadal synthesis of maturing-inducing hormone in salmonids, and as an enzyme protecting against certain reactive oxygen species. We have previously shown that mRNA of the hepatic CR/20 beta-HSD B isoform is increased in rainbow trout caged downstream from a Swedish sewage treatment plant. Here, we report an increase of both the A as well as B form in fish kept downstream from a second sewage treatment plant. The two mRNAs were also induced in fish hepatoma cells in vitro after exposure to effluent extract. This indicates that the effects observed in vivo could be a direct effect on the liver, i.e. the mRNA induction does not require a signal from any other organ. When fish were exposed in vivo to several effluents treated with more advanced methods (ozone, moving bed biofilm reactor or membrane bioreactor) the expression of hepatic mRNA CR/20 beta-HSD A and B was significantly reduced. Their abundance did not parallel the reduction of estrogen-responsive transcripts, in agreement with our previous observations that ethinylestradiol is not a potent inducer. Treatment with norethisterone, methyltestosterone or hydrocortisone in vivo did not induce the hepatic CR/20 beta-HSD A and B mRNA expression. In contrast, both isoforms were markedly induced by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone as well as by the pro-oxidant herbicide paraquat. We hypothesize that the induction of CR/20 beta-HSD A and B by sewage effluents could be due to anthropogenic contaminants stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and/or causing oxidative stress.

AB Industrial wastewater, especially from chemical and pharmaceutical production, often contains substances that need to be eliminated before being discharged into a biological treatment plant and following water bodies. This can be done within the production itself, in selected waste water streams or in a central treatment plant. Each of these approaches has certain advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, a variety of wastewater treatment processes exist that can be applied at each stage, making it a challenging task to choose the best one in economic and ecological terms. In this work a general approach for that and examples from practice are discussed.

AB Solar-powered electrochemical systems have shown promise for onsite wastewater treatment in regions where basic infrastructure for conventional wastewater treatment is not available. To assess the applicability of these systems for trace organic contaminant treatment, test compound electrolysis rate constants were measured in authentic latrine wastewater using mixed-metal oxide anodes coupled with stainless steel cathodes. Complete removal of ranitidine and cimetidine was achieved within 30 min of electrolysis at an applied potential of 3.5 V (0.7 A L-1). Removal of acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, propranolol, and carbamazepine (>80%) was achieved within 3 h of electrolysis. Oxidation of ranitidine, cimetidine, and ciprofloxacin was primarily attributed to reaction with NH2Cl. Transformation of trimethoprim, propranolol, and carbamazepine was attributed to direct electron transfer and to reactions with surface-bound reactive chlorine species. Relative contributions of aqueous phase center dot OH, center dot Cl, center dot Cl-2(-), HOCl/OCl-, and Cl-2 were determined to be negligible based on measured second-order reaction rate constants, probe compound reaction rates, and experiments in buffered Cl- solutions. Electrical energy per order of removal (E-EO) increased with increasing applied potentials and current densities. Test compound removal was most efficient at elevated Cl- concentrations present when treated wastewater is recycled for use as flushing water (i.e., similar to 75 mM Cl-; E-EO = 0.2-6.9 kWh log(-1) m(-3)). Identified halogenated and oxygenated electrolysis products typically underwent further transformations to unidentifiable products within the 3 h treatment cycle. Identifiable halogenated byproduct formation and accumulation was minimized during electrolysis of wastewater containing 75 mM Cl-.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are discharged in municipal wastewater. Effects in aquatic organisms exposed to individual pharmaceuticals in the laboratory have raised concerns regarding the environmental impacts of PPCPs, yet environmental exposures are always to complex mixtures. In this study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) showed significantly decreased embryo production after a 6 week exposure to a pharmaceutical mixture (MIX; 0.5 and 10 mu g L-1) of acetaminophen, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil and venlafaxine and to diluted wastewater effluent (WWE; 5% and 25%). Atretic oocytes and altered ovarian histology were significantly increased in female zebrafish exposed to both concentrations of MIX or WWE, which indicates a direct effect on oocyte development that may account for reduced embryo production. Apoptosis within the thecal and granulosa cell layers was identified in female zebrafish with atresia. Exposures to MIX or WINE at both concentrations severely altered kidney proximal tubule morphology, but no histological impacts on other organs were observed. Exposure of embryos to MIX or WWE at the high concentration significantly increased the incidence of developmental abnormalities. Embryo mortality was elevated with exposure to the high concentration of MIX. These studies indicate that chronic exposure of fish to pharmaceutical mixtures and wastewater impacts reproduction and induces histopathological changes, similar to what we have previously seen with single compound exposures. These data suggest that fish populations exposed to pharmaceuticals discharged in wastewater are at risk of negative impacts to reproductive capacity and health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metformin has been widely used as an oral drug for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, its consumption can be influenced by many economic and social factors. In this study, we investigated the spatial consumption pattern of metformin in China through wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 21 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 19 cities of the northeast China. A method using solid-phase extraction combined with N-Methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) derivatization for GC-MS detection was applied for metformin analysis. In 21 days, metformin showed high stability in wastewater at 24 degrees C and -20 degrees C. The mean concentrations of metformin in all WWTPs ranged from 2.42 mu g L-1 to 53.6 mu g L-1 . The consumption of metformin was 0.66-15.6 mg d(-1) capita(-1) with the mean value of 5.54 +/- 4.28 mg d(-1) capita(-1) . The prevalence of metformin ranged from 0.09% to 2.10% with an average of 0.74%. Both the consumption and prevalence of metformin displays significant spatial variations in northeast China. A statistical correlation analysis indicated that the consumption of metformin increases with the decrease of per capita disposable income of urban residents. To further predict the use of metformin in China, we developed a regress model and depicted a consumption map. The annual consumption of urban residents in Chinese provinces range from 1085-63,828 kg yr(-1) with mean value of 25,347 kg yr(-1) , which would provide a certain reference value for public health care and diabetes control.

AB The increase in human population and urbanization are resulting in an increase in the volume of wastewater and urban runoff effluents entering natural ecosystems. These effluents may contain multiple pollutants to which the biological response of aquatic organisms is still poorly understood mainly due to mixture toxicity and interactions with other environmental factors. In this context, RNA sequencing was used to assess the impact of a chronic exposure to wastewater treatment plant and stormwater effluents at the whole-transcriptome level and evaluate the potential physiological outcomes in the Asian clam Corbicula fiuminea.
   We de-novo assembled a transcriptome from C. fluminea digestive gland and identified a set of 3,181 transcripts with altered abundance in response to water quality. The largest differences in transcriptomic profiles were observed between C. fiuminea from the reference site and those exposed to wastewater treatment plant effluents. On both anthropogenically impacted sites, most differentially expressed transcripts were involved in signaling pathways in relation to energy metabolism such as mTOR and FoxO, suggesting an energy/nutrient deficit and hypoxic conditions. These conditions were likely responsible for damages to proteins and transcripts in response to wastewater treatment effluents whereas exposure to urban runoff might result in immune and endocrine disruptions.
   In absence of comprehensive chemical characterization, the RNAseq approach could provide information regarding the mode of action of pollutants and then be useful for the identification of which parameters must be studied at higher integration level in order to diagnose sites where the presence of complex and variable mixtures of chemicals is suspected.

AB Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is the most widely distributed sulfonamide antibiotics detected in decentralized poultry wastewater in rural communities. As an economically-feasible and eco-friendly technology for decentralized wastewater treatment in rural areas, vertical-flow multi-soil-layering (MSL) system was promising to mitigate the ecological and human health risks from SMX in such areas. The treatment of SMX-contained poultry wastewater by using MSL systems was investigated for the first time, and the main and interactive effects of related multiple variables on system performance were explored through factorial analysis, including material of permeable layer, concentration of SMX, and pH of influent. Results indicated that SMX concentration and pH of influent showed significantly negative effects on SMX removal. Medical stone used in MSL systems with larger surface area could intensify the SMX removal compared to anthracite. MSL systems showed stable performances on SMX removal with the best SMX removal efficiency more than 91%. A novel stepwise-cluster inference (SCI) model was developed for the first time to map the multivariate numeric relationships between state variables and SMX removal under discrete and nonlinear complexities. It was demonstrated that the effect of SMX in wastewater with high concentration was significant on the differentiation of soil bacteria composition in MSL systems based on microbial diversity analysis. These results can help better understand the mechanism of SMX removal in MSL systems from perspectives of factorial analysis, numeric modeling, and microbiological change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Photo-driven advanced oxidation process (AOP) with peracetic acid (PAA) has been poorly investigated in water and wastewater treatment so far. In the present work its possible use as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater to effectively minimize the release into the environment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was investigated. Different initial PAA concentrations, two light sources (sunlight and UV-C) and two different water matrices (groundwater (GW) and wastewater (WW)) were studied. Low PM doses were found to be effective in the inactivation of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (AR E. coli) in GW, with the UV-C process being faster (limit of detection (LOD) achieved for a cumulative energy (Q(UV)) of 0.3 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PAA L-1) than solar driven one (LOD achieved at Q(UV) = 4.4 kJL(-1) with 0.2 mg PM L-1). Really fast inactivation rates of indigenous AR E. coli were also observed in WW. Higher Q(UV) and PM initial doses were necessary to effectively remove the three target CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole), with CBZ being the more refractory one. In conclusion, photo-driven AOP with PM can be effectively used as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater but initial PM dose should be optimized to find the best compromise between target bacteria inactivation and CECs removal as well as to prevent scavenging effect of PM on hydroxyl radicals because of high PM concentration.

AB Antibiotics are added to agricultural fields worldwide through wastewater irrigation or manure application, resulting in antibiotic contamination and elevated environmental risks to terrestrial environments and humans. Most studies focused on antibiotic detection in different matrices or were conducted in a hydroponic environment. Little is known about the transfer of antibiotics from antibiotic contaminated irrigation wastewater and animal manure to agricultural soil and edible crops. In this study, we evaluated the transfer of five different antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethazine, norfloxacin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol) to different crops under two levels of antibiotic-contaminated wastewater irrigation and animal manure fertilization. The final distribution of tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR) and chloramphenicol (CAP) in the crop tissues under these four treatments were as follows: fruit > leaf/shoot > root, while an opposite order was found for sulfamethazine (SMZ) and erythromycin (ERY): root > leaf/shoot > fruit. The growth of crops could accelerate the dissipation of antibiotics by absorption from contaminated soil. A higher accumulation of antibiotics was observed in crop tissues under the wastewater treatment than under manure treatment, which was due to the continual irrigation that increased adsorption in soil and uptake by crops. The translocation of antibiotics in crops mainly depended on their physicochemical properties (e.g. log K-ow), crop species, and the concentrations of antibiotics applied to the soil. The levels of antibiotics ingested through the consumption of edible crops under the different treatments were much lower than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of the UV-C/free chlorine (FC) process on the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from real urban wastewater as well as the effect of UV-C radiation on the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) compared to FC process alone was investigated. Unlike of FC process, UV-C/FC was really effective in the degradation of the target CECs (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and imidacloprid) in real wastewater (87% degradation of total CECs within 60 min, Q(UVC) =1.33 kJ L-1), being CBZ the most refractory one (49.5%, after 60 min). The UV-C radiation significantly affected the formation of THMs. THMs concentration (mainly chloroform) was lower in IJV-C/FC process after 30 min treatment (<1 mu gL(-1) = limit of quantification (LOQ)) than in FC process in dark (23 mu gL(-1)). Noteworthy, while in FC treated wastewater chloroform concentration increased after treatment, UV-C/FC process resulted in a significant decrease (residual concentrations below the LOQ), even after 24 h and 48 h post-treatment incubation. The formation of radicals due to UV-C/FC process can reduce THMs compared to chlorination process, because part of FC reacts with UV-C radiation to form radicals and it is no longer available to form THMs. These results are encouraging in terms of possible use of UV-C/FC process as advanced treatment of urban wastewater even for possible effluent reuse.

AB Retention soil filters (RSFs) are vertical flow constructed wetlands. They are mainly used for the treatment of combined sewer overflow or stormwater, and not operated during dry weather conditions. However, RSFs have been successfully tested as continuous post treatment for sewage treatment plant effluents. In this paper we present a new approach, namely dual usage of the retention soil filter. During dry weather the RSF is used for the polishing treatment of sewage treatment plant effluent and during overflow events, the retention soil filter treats the combined sewer overflow. This study was conducted at two pilot RSFs that were fed with sewage treatment effluent for four years. Removal of TOC, DOC, nutrients and 21 organic micropollutants was determined during six months at different sequences of regular effluent and overflow treatment conditions. TOC, DOC and nutrients, appearing in high concentration in combined sewer overflow, were effectively removed, and metformin and caffeine micropollutants showed >99% removal. Residues from this combined sewer treatment that were sorbed on filter material or stored in pore water were washed out directly after treatment when STP effluent infiltration was initiated. This effect declined within 20 h after combined sewer overflow treatment. Dry periods of 18 h between combined sewer and sewage treatment plant effluent feeding counteracted the wash out effects. The highest removal efficiency was found in the beginning of the feeding time of 28 h, indicating that shorter feeding cycles enhance the overall efficiency of the RSF. Finally, the results show that a single RSF system can successfully reduce emissions of TOC, DOC, nutrients and micropollutants to surface waters from two different emission pathways, i.e. from regular treated effluents and storm related sewer overflows. In conclusion, the dual usage of RSF is a promising approach and ready for upscaling and implementation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban, hospital and pharmaceutical industry wastewater effluents are among the main sources of antibiotics' and other antimicrobial agents' contamination in soil and water ecosystems, especially in countries where wastewater reuse is applied. Ampicillin (AMP), which is the first semi-synthetic broad spectrum penicillin that was released on the market in 1961 has been detected in treated wastewater effluents worldwide, at concentrations ranging from sub-ng/L up to 27 mu g/L, as well as in various environmental aqueous matrices up to 13.7 mu g/L, highlighting its recalcitrance to conventional biological treatment. Nevertheless, the degradation potential of AMP via advanced chemical oxidation processes, which are widely considered as promising alternatives of conventional technologies, hardly has been investigated. Thus, this study aims at assessing the efficiency of solar photo-Fenton process at degrading AMP from secondary-treated wastewater effluents under various experimental conditions. The degradation rate of AMP via solar photo-Fenton oxidation fitted well the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. AMP was completely degraded after 30 min of treatment at various H2O2 doses (25-100 mg/L) under acidic pH, while its degradation was pronounced at mild alkaline conditions (inherent pH) (100% removal after 5 min). Total cultivable and AMP-resistant E. coli was completely inactivated after 180 min of treatment at the optimum operational conditions, and no regrowth was observed. Finally, the ecotoxicity results showed that the process was capable of eliminating the toxicity towards Daphnia magna after 180 min, providing thus a more complete evaluation of the overall efficiency of the process.

AB Anti-influenza drugs constitute a key component of pandemic preparedness plans against influenza. However, the occurrence of such drugs in water environments, the potential of resistance development in the natural hosts, and the risk for transmission of antiviral resistance to humans call for measures to increase removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, removal of three anti-influenza drugs; amantadine (AM), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and zanamivir (ZA), and formation/removal of their transformation products during ozonation of wastewater effluents from two Swedish WWTPs in Uppsala and Stockholm were studied. The removal profile of target antivirals and formation/removal of their transformation products were studied by liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. 3.5 h of ozone exposure (total dose of ozone 5.95 g) led to complete removal of the three anti-influenza drugs with a degradation in the following order ZA > OC > AM. Two, five and one transformation products were identified and semi-quantified for AM, OC and ZA, respectively. Increasing and later decreasing transformation products concentration followed the decrease in concentration of target compounds. All transformation products detected, except one of AM in wastewater from Stockholm WWTP, were removed at the end of the experiment. The removal efficiency was higher for all studied compounds in wastewater from Uppsala WWTP, which had lower TOC and COD values, less phosphorus, and also higher pH in the water. Ozonation thus offers multiple benefits through its potential to degrade influenza antivirals, hence decrease the risk of environmental resistance development, in addition to degrading other pharmaceuticals and resistant microorganisms.

AB Growing attention is given to pharmaceutical residue in the water environment. It is known that pharmaceuticals are able to survive from a series of wastewater treatment processes. Concerns regarding pharmaceutical residues are attributed to the fact that they are being detected in water and sediment environment ubiquitously. Pharmaceutical treatment using a series of wastewater treatment processes of the DAF (dissolved air flotation)-MBR (membrane bioreactor)-ozone oxidation was conducted in the study. DAF, without addition of coagulant, could remove CODcr (chemical oxygen demand by Cr) up to over 70%, BOD 73%, SS 83%, T-N 55%, NH4+ 23%, and T-P 65% in influent of municipal wastewater. Average removal rates of water quality parameters by the DAF-MBR system were very high, e.g. CODcr 95.88%, BOD5 99.66%, CODmn (chemical oxygen demand by Mn) 93.63%, T-N 69.75%, NH4-N 98.46%, T-P 78.23%, and SS 99.51%, which satisfy effluent water quality standards. Despite the high removal rate of the wastewater treatment system, pharmaceuticals were eliminated to be about 50-99% by the MBR system, depending on specific pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen was well removed by MBR system up to over 95%, while removal rate of bezafibrate ranged between 50 and 90%. With over 5 mg/l of ozone oxidation, most pharmaceuticals which survived the DAF-MBR process were removed completely or resulted in very low survival rate within the range of few micrograms per litre. However, some pharmaceuticals such as bezafibrate and naproxen tended to be resistant to ozone oxidation.

AB 100 ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) copolymer precursor and metabolites were detected in wastewater effluents. The homopolymers of EO and PO as well as the EO/PO copolymers are widely used as surfactants, e.g., for the production of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and lubricants. Concomitantly, these compounds are discharged into the wastewater and the environmental fate of the PO homopolymers, also called polypropylene glycols (PPGs), and EO/PO copolymers is mostly unknown. In the present study, we identified hitherto unknown copolymer EO/PO homologous series and their metabolites in wastewater effluent. The identified compounds occur in homologous series and consist of PPGs and EO/PO copolymers, and their carbonylated, carboxylated and dicarboxylated metabolites. MBBR lab incubations of PPGs and EO/PO copolymers showed the successive degradation by cleavage of individual PO and EO groups, with high removal (>90%) in the initial 8 h for most of the copolymers. Carbonylated and carboxylated metabolites were degraded within 40 h. EO/PO copolymers with a higher number of EO and PO units showed a higher removal in MBBR and conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants. Polymers with lower molecular weight were initially formed by degradation of the EO/PO polymers. The mono-carboxylated metabolites were also detected in surface waters. Overall, our results provide new knowledge about degradation pathways of PO containing compounds and show the hitherto unnoticed occurrence of EO/PO copolymers and metabolites in the water cycle.

AB Urine source separation has the potential to reduce pharmaceutical loading to the environment, while enhancing nutrient recovery. The focus of this life cycle assessment (LCA) was to evaluate the environmental impacts and economic costs to manage nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (i.e., diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) and nutrients in human urine. Urine source separation was compared with centralized wastewater treatment (WWT) (biological or upgraded with ozonation). The current treatment method (i.e., centralized biological WWT) was compared with hypothetical treatment scenarios (i.e., centralized biological WWT upgraded with ozonation, and urine source separation). Alternative urine source separation scenarios included varying collection and handling methods (i.e., collection by vacuum truck, vacuum sewer, or decentralized treatment), pharmaceuticals removal by ion-exchange, and struvite precipitation. Urine source separation scenarios had 90% lower environmental impact (based,on the TRACI impact assessment method) compared with the centralized wastewater scenarios due to reduced potable water production for flush water, reduced electricity use at the wastewater treatment plant, and nutrient offsets from struvite precipitation. Despite the greatest reduction of pharmaceutical toxicity, centralized treatment upgraded with ozone had the greatest ecotoxicity impacts due to ozonation, operation and infrastructure. Among urine source separation scenarios, decentralized treatment of urine and centralized treatment of urine collected by vacuum truck had negligible cost differences compared with centralized wastewater treatment. Centralized treatment of urine collected by vacuum sewer and centralized treatment with ozone cost 30% more compared with conventional wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging organic contaminants have not received a lot of attention in developing countries, particularly Africa, although problems regarding water quantity and quality are often even more severe than in more developed regions. This study presents general water quality parameters as well as unique data on concentrations and loads of 24 pharmaceuticals including antibiotic, anti(retro)viral, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and psychiatric drugs in three wastewater treatment plants, three rivers and three groundwater wells in Nairobi and Kisumu. This allowed studying removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment, identifying important sources of pharmaceutical pollution and distinguishing dilution effects from natural attenuation in rivers. In general, antiretrovirals and antibiotics, being important in the treatment of common African diseases such as HIV and malaria, were in all matrices more prevalent as compared to the Western world. Wastewater stabilization ponds removed pharmaceuticals with an efficiency between 11 and 99%. Despite this large range, a different removal is observed for a number of compounds, as compared to more conventional activated sludge systems. Total concentrations in river water (up to 320 mu g L-1) were similar or exceeded concentrations in untreated wastewater, with domestic discharges from slums, wastewater treatment plant effluent and waste dumpsites identified as important sources. In shallow wells situated next to pit latrines and used for drinking water, the recalcitrant antiretroviral nevirapine was measured at concentrations as high as 1 -2 mu g L-1. Overall, distinct pharmaceutical contamination patterns as compared to the Western world can be concluded, which might be a trigger for further research in developing regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prior measurements at bench scale revealed that waterless urinal cartridges containing oily sealant fluids are capable of partitioning pharmaceuticals from urine and therefore reducing their concentration in wastewater. We sought to measure pharmaceutical removal from in-use waterless urinals. We developed a method to quantify pharmaceuticals in the sealant phase, which resulted in 79 +/- 30% and 71 +/- 30% recovery of eight pharmaceuticals from two sealant fluids, respectively. The method was applied to sealant samples collected over three weeks from in-use waterless urinals on a university campus. Six of eight pharmaceuticals were present in the sealant samples from 1.4 mu g/L to 241 mu g/L. Loads of the six pharmaceuticals detected in the sealants were removed from the receiving wastewater from 0.02 mu g/day to 3.4 mu g/day across the sampling period. The concentration of the pharmaceuticals were similar over time, indicating rapid saturation and washout of the sealant. We also observed relatively rapid loss of sealant at maintenance intervals consistent with the manufacturer's instructions. These findings indicate that while waterless urinals do remove some pharmaceuticals from the wastewater stream, meaningful changes to wastewater concentrations will only result if the sealant fluid and/or the urinal cartridge are significantly modified. Practitioner points We developed a quantification method for pharmaceuticals in oily waterless urinal sealants. Pharmaceuticals were present at relatively low concentrations in the sealant phase of two in-use waterless urinals. We identify engineering challenges that must be overcome to meaningfully reduce pharmaceutical loads in wastewater with waterless urinals.

AB De facto (or indirect) wastewater reuse is the practice of extracting from surface water bodies which are impacted by treated wastewater (TWW) for anthropogenic use. The extent to which surface water bodies in the Netherlands are impacted by TWW is poorly understood, and the distribution of de facto reuse even more so. This study addresses these knowledge gaps, with a focus on reuse for agricultural irrigation. This is achieved via a novel application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Explorer water quality model, allowing for the distribution of different flow components-namely TWW and flow from transboundary rivers-to be discerned for the national surface water network. When paired with data on surface water extractions for irrigation, this identifies notable areas of de facto reuse. Results show that during dry conditions, TWW is a significant flow component in many surface water bodies, particularly in smaller streams located close to WWTPs. De facto reuse is indicated as widespread, with several key areas identified in which extractions are from impacted surface water bodies. This study represents a first attempt to directly link TWW emissions to agricultural irrigation, highlighting a mechanism by which wastewater-associated contaminants can propagate through the hydrological system.

AB New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are an ever-changing class of compounds designed to imitate the effects of current recreational drugs. Such a diverse market is difficult to assess by traditional means, while collected information can become obsolete before it is available. Wastewater-based epidemiology is one technique which can capture information on where and when NPS appear at the community level. The aim of this study was to identify NPS in wastewater samples using a suspect screening approach. Weekend samples were collected from 50 wastewater treatment plants from Australian capital cities and regional areas across all eight States and Territories and screened against a database containing almost 200 NPS. A total of 22 different NPS were found across all regional and metropolitan wastewater treatment plants. Results showed that the most detected compounds were of the cathinone class, with both Alpha-PVP and methcathinone found in every region. In addition, five different synthetic cannabinoids were detected, at least once in half of the regions analysed. Herein, we report the first comprehensive nationwide analysis of NPS and show the utility of liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry screening for delivering spatial information of the NPS being consumed in communities.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater has become an important source for emitting antibiotics into aquatic environments. However, this study aims to evaluate the potential of different advanced oxidation processes like ozonation, photolysis, and photo-catalysis for degrading a fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) in real pharmaceutical wastewater. The raw wastewater contains a high concentration of organic content (COD: 603 mg/L, BOD: 116 mg/L) and significant concentration of CIP (7.91 mg/L). In ozonation, compared with the acidic and basic conditions, the degradation rate was faster under basic conditions and showed a competently degraded CIP (up to 98.7%) under the optimum pH 9 within 30 min, whereas photo-catalysis by using commercial anatase (TiO2) is considered to be the most effective technique for decreasing the concentration of CIP up to 100% within 30 min under the optimized TiO2 dose (1000 mg/L). The degradation rate was quicker and found to be several times faster than in direct photolysis. Furthermore, electrical energy per order was also calculated for all processes and was obvious by the results that photo-catalysis consume less energy of about 8.7 kWh/m(3), for almost complete deduction of CIP.

AB The anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) receives growing attention due to slow biodegradation and inherent accumulation in the aquatic environment. The application of a gas-phase pulsed corona discharge (PCD) was investigated to remove CBZ from synthetic solutions and spiked wastewater effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. The treated water was showered between high voltage (HV) wires and grounded plate electrodes, to which ultra-short HV pulses were applied. CBZ was readily oxidized and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydroquinazoline-2-one (BQM) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) were identified as the most abundant primary transformation products, which, contrary to CBZ ozonation data available in the literature, were further easily oxidized with PCD: BQM and BQD attributed to only a minor portion of the target compound oxidized. In concentrations commonly found in wastewater treatment plant effluents (around 5 mu g L-1), up to 97% reduction in CBZ concentration was achieved at mere 0.3 kW h m(-3) energy consumption, and over 99.9% was removed at 1 kW h m(-3). The PCD application proved to be efficient in the removal of both the parent substance and its known transformation products, even with the competing reactions in the complex composition of wastewater.

AB The occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and the pesticide atrazine were investigated in seawater samples collected from stations located at effluent dominated sites in the Saudi Arabian coastal waters of the Red Sea. PPCPs were analysed using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A multi component method for the ultra -trace level quantification of 13 target PPCPs in Seawater was developed and validated for the here performed study. The method procedure is described in detail in the supplementary material section. 26 samples from 7 distinct locations (2 directly influenced by continuous sewage release) were chosen for the sampling of surface seawater. Based upon local sales information, 25 target substances (20 PPCPs, 4 pesticides and 1 stimulant) were chosen for the here reported method development. Thirteen PPCPs were detected and quantified in a total of 26 seawater samples. Metformin, diclofenac, acetaminophen, and caffeine were identified as the most abundant PPCPs, detected in maximum concentration higher than 3 mu g/L (upper quantification limit for the here developed method). Concentrations were in the range of 7- > 3000 (metformin), < LOQ - 2379 ng/L (acetaminophen) and 62- > 3000 ng/L (caffeine). The contribution of direct sewage release on the PPCP levels detected was obvious, the target PPCPs were detected in the Al-Arbaeen and Al-Shabab coastal lagoons in high concentrations due to the low water exchange with the open sea and still ongoing sewage releases in the lagoons. Also, substantial amounts of antibiotics were detected in all samples. Levels and distribution profile of the detected PPCPs revealed high level release rates and give raise to concern on potential environmental risks associated with the here document long term exposure on the fragile coastal marine environment of the region but particularly in the nearby protected coral reef environment outside the harbour region of Jeddah.

AB Due to the lack of wastewater treatment facility in Pakistan, the wastewater is directly discharged via urban drains, which might cause a high load of contaminants of emerging concerns and potential environmental risks. The present study focused on the occurrence and risk assessment of 52 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) of diversified classes in the water and sediment samples of urban drains and canal of Lahore, Pakistan. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the predominant PPCPs detected in the wastewater of urban drains and surface water of canal. The highest concentration was observed for acetaminophen, with median concentration of 13,880 ng/L followed by caffeine with median concentration of 6200 ng/L. Antibiotics were the predominant PPM in the sediment samples with highest concentration of ofloxacin (median value of 1980 mu g/kg) followed by ciprofloxacin and oxytetracycline. Spatial variation showed that the population density has significant correlation with the level of many PPCPs in surface water while one of the drainage systems is affected by the direct wastewater discharge from the nearby industrial arca. Ecological risk assessment in terms of risk quotient revealed that most of the PPCPs may cause high risk to the aquatic community.

AB The toxic action of graphene oxide (GO) and the micropollutants contained in a biologically-treated wastewater were studied alone and in combination. For the toxicity assays, the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was used and the toxic mechanism was assessed by studying changes in esterase activity, cytoplasmic membrane potential, membrane integrity, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), changes in intracellular calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial ROS formation. The joint toxic effect was quantified using the combination index (CI)-isobologram method using 72 h growth rate data. The pollutants monitored were polar pharmaceuticals, metabolites and artificial sweeteners with concentrations from tens of ng L-1 to several g L-1. The amount of compounds adsorbed on GO reached 89.5 g g(-1) with preferential adsorption for the more hydrophilic. The most adsorbed compounds were azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, metoclopramide, ofloxacin, and ranitidine. GO induced cell damage due to oxidative stress. Short-term defence response was observed consisting of an increase in intracellular calcium levels and higher metabolic activity. Long-term damage was evidenced by mitochondrial ROS increase and strong depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane. Cells exposed to GO-wastewater mixtures were considerably less affected with lower or non-significant damage in comparison with GO or wastewater alone. GO-wastewater mixtures displayed considerable antagonism for the lower values of assayed concentrations. The antagonism was attributed to the adsorption of toxic chemicals on the surface of GO nanoparticles and to the higher aggregation of GO in wastewater. The results show that non-additive interactions at low effect levels cannot be generally neglected.

AB Chlorine disinfection of wastewater was investigated to determine the reaction rate constant of the disinfection process at the Kanapaha Water Reclamation Facility in Gainesville, FL. Chlorine reactions with wastewater occurred in the contact basin, and they could be characterized by partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition to the difficulties of the solution of these PDEs, the determination of the reaction rate constant of chlorine disinfection is also difficult because of complex reactions with ammonia and the dynamic behavior of wastewater. These vary depending on the influent ammonia concentration, chlorine dosage, and wastewater content and flow rate. A method of characteristics and an odometric transformation technique were applied to these equations to more easily obtain a solution. The method of characteristics is a mathematical solution technique that transforms a PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Because the disinfection reaction also has a large and variable time delay, the odometric transformation technique was introduced to eliminate this obstacle. The application of these mathematical solution and transformation techniques converted the dynamics of the system into a constant time-delay model and a set of ODEs. To validate the model and determine the reaction rate constant by simulation, the resulting equations were coded in Matlab and solved numerically. The validation was performed by a comparison of the simulated response of the developed model with the experimental data using Matlab software packages. The validation criterion was the obtainment of the highest fit (%) for the simulated result. The simulation results revealed that the fit (%) was the highest when the reaction rate constant was 0.0074h(-1).

AB In this paper, in-situ fabrication of tungsten oxide (WO3) on carbon nano-tube (CNT) was performed via sol-gel/hydrothermal method to prepare WO3/CNT nanocomposites and then coupled with visible light and ultrasound (US) irradiations for sono-photocatalytic removal of tetracycline (TTC) and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TEM, UV-VIS DRS, FESEM, EDS, TGA, BET, BJH, EIS, and EDX techniques. The characterization tests, indicated successful incorporation of CTNs into the WO3 framework and efficient reduction of charge carries recombination rate after modifying with CNT. The investigation of experimental parameters verified that 60 mg/L TTC could be perfectly degraded at optimum operational parameters (WO3/CNT: 0.7 g/L, pH: 9.0, US power: 250 W/m(2), and light intensity: 120 W/m(2) over 60 min treatment. Trapping experiments results verified that HO% radicals and h(+) were the main oxidative species in degradation of TTC. The as-prepared photocatalysts could be reused after six successive cycles with an approximately 8.8 % reduction in removal efficiency. Investigation of the effect of real pharmaceutical wastewater revealed that this system is able to eliminate 83.7 and 90.6 % of TOC and COD, respectively after 220 min of reaction time. Some compounds with lower toxic impact and molecular weight, compared to raw pharmaceutical wastewater, were detected after treatment by sono-photocatalysis process. The biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater was improved significantly after treatment by WO3/CNT sono-photocatalysis.

AB The pollution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been highlighted on a global scale because of their serious threats to the environment and human health. Typical urban water in cities with high population density are ideal mediums for the acquisition and spread of antibiotics and ARGs. The pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs in hospital wastewater, groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates through three sewage treatment plants (STPs) were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the 11 detected antibiotics ranged from not detected (ND)-16800 ng L-1 in diverse water samples from Beijing, and fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in the hospital samples. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics in STPs and hospital were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the surface water from Wenyu River and groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by treatment processes were observed for tetracyclines and quinolones, and low removal efficiencies were observed for sulfonamides and macrolides. These results also revealed that the sulfonamide resistance genes (sull, sul2) and macrolide resistance genes (ermB) were detected at the highest relative abundances (7.11 x 10(-2)-1.18 x 10(-1)) in the water bodies of Beijing. It was worth noting that sull abundance was the highest in groundwater samples. The relative abundance of most ARGs in STPs exhibited a declining trend in the order of influent > secondary effluents > effluent. However, the relative abundance of sul 1, sul 2 and tetC in the effluent was higher than those in the influent. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in STPs poses a serious threat to the receiving rivers, and affects ecosystem security. Overall, our findings provide favorable support for a further investigation of the spread and risk of antibiotics and ARGs from diverse sources (e.g., STPs and hospitals) to the aquatic environment.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments has become a major issue of concern for scientific community, since there is a lack of information about risks and impacts to the environment and public health. In the context of Brazil, many cities do not have Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) and domestic sewage is dumped directly into the water bodies, aggravating the problem. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the presence of 28 prescribed pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic classes in six full-scale Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTPs) in Minas Gerais state. Samples were collected in twelve field campaigns from August 2016 to August 2017 and water quality were monitored. Analytical methodology was based on solid phase extraction (C18 cartridge) followed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Prominence DGU/20A3 - Shimadzu) coupled to Mass Spectrometry (micrOTOF-QJI - Bruker). Considering the 28 pharmaceuticals analyzed, 18 were detected in the surface water source at concentrations ranging from Method Quantification Limit (MQL) to 11,960 ng/L. In drinking water, the concentration of the 11 pharmaceuticals detected ranged from <MQL to 6323 ng/L. Betamethasone, Fluconazole, Atorvastatin and Prednisone were the most detected pharmaceuticals. The drinking water monitoring showed a decrease in the concentration of all detected pharmaceuticals, indicating some removal of these compounds by the water treatment processes. The removal efficiency assessed shows a great variation among different compounds, DWTPs and over the year, ranging from an average of 32% +/- 6% (Prednisone -DWTP3) to 100% +/- 0% for some pharmaceuticals. The highest total concentrations and the maximum concentration values for the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were related to the winter due, presumably, to lower dilution and temperature.
   Trace levels of pharmaceuticals were detected in surface and drinking water in Brazil and conventional DWTPs were not able to remove the pharmaceuticals completely. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an ever-increasing discipline that enables researchers to track near-real-time data concerning the recreational use of illicit drugs. Community illicit drug use was estimated in eleven Turkish cities, using eighteen wastewater treatment plants, representing the metropolitan cities and rural areas with different socio-demographic characteristics. In this study, 24-h composite influent wastewater samples were collected for 1 week per season between March 2019 and December 2019. Heroin, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana were covered as illicit drugs in this study. Solid-phase extraction, LC-MS/MS separation, identification, and quantification were used as the analytical methods. Overall results indicate that both cocaine and MDMA usage increased in all cities on weekends. More specifically, it was observed that the average amount of cocaine use regarding 11 cities was 14.7 mg/1000 person/day, while figures for other substances are as follows: 9.5 for amphetamine, 34.5 for methamphetamine, 38.4 for MDMA, 42.2 for heroin, and lastly 5412 mg/1000p/day for marijuana. This study holds the position of being the most comprehensive one conducted, considering spatial and temporal datasets on illicit drug consumption obtained via WBE in Turkey.

AB Municipal wastewater contains multi-component mixtures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This could shape microbial communities in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and the effluent-receiving ecosystems. In this paper we assess the risk of antimicrobial effects in STPs and the aquatic environment for a mixture of 18 APIs that was previously detected in the effluent of a European municipal STP. Effects on microbial consortia (collected from a separate STP) were determined using respirometry, enumeration of culturable microorganisms and community-level physiological profiling. The mixture toxicity against selected bacteria was assessed using assays with Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio fischeri. Additional data on the toxicity to environmental bacteria were compiled from literature in order to assess the individual and expected joint bacterial toxicity of the pharmaceuticals in the mixture. The reported effluent concentration of the mixture was 15.4 nmol/l and the lowest experimentally obtained effect concentrations (EC10) were 242 nmol/l for microbial consortia in STPs, 225 nmol/l for P. putida and 73 nmol/l for V. fischeri. The lowest published effect concentrations (EC50) of the individual antibiotics in the mixture range between 15 and 150 nmol/l, whereas 0.9-190 mu mol/l was the range of bacterial EC50, values found for the non-antibiotic mixture components. Pharmaceutical cocktails could shape microbial communities at concentrations relevant to STPs and the effluent receiving aquatic environment. The risk of antimicrobial mixture effects was completely dominated by the presence of antibiotics, whereas other pharmaceutical classes contributed only negligibly to the mixture toxicity. The joint bacterial toxicity can be accurately predicted from the individual toxicity of the mixture components, provided that standardized data on representative bacterial strains becomes available for all relevant compounds. These findings argue for a more sophisticated bacterial toxicity assessment of environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals, especially for those with a mode of action that is known to specifically affect prokaryotic microorganisms.

AB Direct CO2 emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are commonly excluded from the greenhouse gas emission inventory as proposed by the International Panel on Climate Change, should be partly taken into consideration, because some of the fossil organic carbons (i.e. detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals) are also biodegradable, leading to the emission of CO2 during wastewater treatment. For the purpose of understanding the characteristics of direct CO2 emissions during biological nutrient removal from urban WWTPs, we investigated four different processes. Full-scale tests were carried out continuously during a two-year period, consisting of the anoxic/anaerobic/oxic (A(2)O) process, the anoxic/oxic (AO) process, the oxidation ditch, and the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) processes. Our experimental results show large differences in CO2 fluxes in the various treatment tanks (or periods), e.g. the aerated units/periods in four different WWTPs all contributed more than 96.0% of the entire direct CO2 emission caused by aerobic respiration and aeration stripping. On the other hand, CO2 emissions from non-aerated areas were quite low giving rise to small amounts of CO2 emissions during anaerobic metabolism. The direct emission of CO2 when treating per m(3) wastewater (g CO2/m(3) wastewater) corresponded with the following descending order among the four processes: SBR (347.34) > oxidation ditch (343.78) > A(2)O (175.68) > AO (173.37). However, this order changed into SBR (0.97) > oxidation ditch (0.76) > AO (0.68) > A(2)O (0.58) when treating per kilogram COD (kg CO2/kg COD).

AB It is a technical barrier to efficiently treat traditional Chinese pharmaceutical (TCP) wastewater, due to its high chemical oxygen demanding (COD) concentration (>5000 mg/L). This study proposed and employed a spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor (SSSAB) to treat TCP wastewater. Results showed that a pilot-scale SSSAB (150 L) could achieve COD removal efficiency of 94.8% and volumetric removal rate (VRR) of 19.7 +/- 0.7 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1) under room temperature, which were much higher than operation performance in internal circulation (IC) anaerobic reactor (COD removal efficiency and VRR were 85% and 113 +/- 0.8 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1), respectively). The maximum COD volume removal rate could attain 43.4 kg COD.(m(3).d)(-1). The characteristics of granular sludge in SSSAB were investigated from both temporal and spatial scales. During the operation period, the anaerobic granular sludge in SSSAB was of higher concentration and superior properties compared to the IC anaerobic reactor. The sludge concentration exhibited a spatially decline trend, decreasing from 61 g L-1 in the bottom to 34 g.L-1 at the top of the bed, yet the average biomass concentration was still higher than that in IC reactor. According to shock tests with fluctuated real wastewater, the resistance of SSSAB to hydraulic and loading shock was up to 4.3 m h(-1) and 42 (kg COD.h).(m(3))(-1), respectively. The study demonstrated the proposed SSSAB is a promising reactor to treat high-concentration TCP wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The toxicity of water-receiving bodies, the effluent and other treatment stages in wastewater treatment plants has recently been of interest to the public due to the lack of a regulated toxicity-based index for wastewater discharge in China. This study aimed to evaluate the conventional pollution parameters and toxicities of wastewaters collected at different treatment stages from a pharmaceutical industrial park wastewater treatment plant through dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and bioluminescent bacteria (Vibrio qinghaiensis) tests. The results of an analysis of conventional parameters indicated that the total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) were largely removed after various treatments. However, the TN, NH3-N and COD still exceeded the regulated standards. The tested pharmaceutical park effluents were mainly polluted with organic pollutants and nitrogenous. The toxicity test results indicated that the toxicities could be markedly reduced after treatment, with the toxicities of two out of the six effluent samples at different treatment stages being greater than the influent toxicity. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients indicated a significantly positive correlation between the toxicity values obtained using the DHA and Vibrio qinghaiensis tests. Compared with the DHA measurement, the Vibrio qinghaiensis test was faster and more sensitive. Meanwhile, the toxicity indicators were significantly and positively correlated with the TSS, TN, TP and COD concentrations. These results may aid the understanding of the toxicity of pharmaceutical industrial park wastewaters and toxicity removal using the treatment techniques that are currently utilized in China.

AB Toxic effects of herbal pharmaceutical wastewater on common fish (Lebistes reticulatus) under laboratory conditions were studied. LC50 values for raw, neutralized, and physico-chemically treated effluent for 24, 48, 72, and 96h ranged between 3.0-9.5%, 5.0-10.5%, and 35-41%, respectively. It was evident from the studies that physico-chemical treatment reduces the toxicity by more than 30%. This article discusses in detail the bioassay evaluation of raw, neutralized, and primary treated effluent. Physico-chemically treated effluent was further subjected to biological treatment by activated sludge system. Effluent from biological treatment revealed no toxic effect even after one month of exposure.

AB The presence of various classes of pharmaceutical drugs in different environmental compartments has been reported worldwide. In South Africa, the detection of pharmaceuticals especially the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is recent, and more studies are being done in order to fully understand their fate in the aquatic environment. With considerations for the need of better sample preparation techniques, this study synthesized a molecularly imprinted polymer for the selective extraction of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, fenoprofen in aqueous environmental samples. Batch adsorption studies showed that adsorption of fenoprofen onto the cavities of the polymer followed a Langmuir isotherm as well as a pseudo second order model implying formation of a monolayer on the surface through chemisorption. The polymer had a maximum adsorption capacity of 38.8mgg(-1) and a Langmuir surface area of 1607m(2)g(-1). The imprinted polymer was then used as the selective sorbent for solid phase extraction in the analysis of fenoprofen from wastewater followed by chromatographic determination. The analytical method gave a detection limit of 0.64ngmL(-1) and recovery of 99.6%. The concentration of fenoprofen detected in influent and effluent samples from two wastewater treatment plants ranged from 24 to 58ngmL(-1). The ability of the treatment plants to remove fenoprofen during wastewater processing based on the difference in concentrations in influent and effluent samples was found to be 41%. This work has shown that there is a possibility of release of fenoprofen from wastewater treatment plants into surface water sources.

AB As a consequence of population growth and urbanization, arable fields are increasingly irrigated with wastewater, but the related environmental and health risks (e. g., pollution with antibiotics) are poorly understood. We performed batch sorption experiments with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) and soils that had been irrigated with untreated wastewater for 0, 14, 35, and 100 yr. Sorption of CIP was always strong and largely irreversible irrespective of the duration of wastewater irrigation and the content and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) (Freundlich sorption coefficient, K-F: 346-979 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1); 1/n: 0.62-0.76) but decreased with increasing soil pH due to a decreasing fraction of the cationic species. Sorption of SMX and sorption hysteresis were stronger in the nonirrigated soil (K-F: 4.14 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1) +/- 0.02; 1/n: 0.69 =/- 0.02) than in the irrigated soils (K-F: 0.65-1.38 mg(1-1/n) L-1/n kg(-1); 1/n: 0.68-0.75). Irrigation (e. g., competition with SMX accumulated in soil or with other organic compounds contained in wastewater) and SOM quality (i.e., increase of carboxylic moieties with increasing time of irrigation) had a stronger effect on SMX sorption and its hysteresis than soil organic carbon content. Whereas sorption of SMX can be reduced by long-term irrigation with wastewater, sorption of CIP is intense also after prolonged irrigation.

AB Diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX) and ibuprofen (IBF) are three of the most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worldwide. They are widely detected in natural waters due to their persistence in wastewater treatment, and their removal is desirable in future wastewater management worldwide. In this study, "acid catalyst" functionalisation and subsequent carbonisation were adopted to synthesise a P-doped microporous carbonous adsorbent (CScPA) for NSAID removal. The CScPA was evaluated in depth for its adsorption performance (i.e., isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption at lab-scale). The CScPA had a large surface area (791.1 m(2)/g) and good porosity (0.392 cm(3)/g), which facilitated a high maximum adsorption capacity of 62.02 mg/g for a NSAID mixture. Thermodynamic data indicated that the adsorption of these NSAIDs was an endothermic process determined by physisorption (low-energy interactions). XPS analysis revealed the specific interactions involved in the adsorption process, including pi-pi and pi-pi electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrogen (H-) bonding. The Freundlich isotherm and Elovich kinetic model provided the best fit to the experimental results, which indicated surface heterogeneity (of the CScPA) and cooperative adsorption mechanisms. The adsorption process was shown to have potential to be applied to real wastewater effluent containing NSAIDs at low environmentally relevant concentrations (removal reached > 90% at 10 mu g/L). Analysis of different implementation and cost related factors suggested that the CScPA has the potential for use with "real-world" water matrices, offering a sustainable treatment process for pharmaceutical remediation in wastewater.

AB Studies conducted globally have identified wastewater effluent as a key source of UV filters released into the aquatic environment. We assessed the annual release of UV filters from wastewater treatment plant effluent in Australia and evaluated the removal of these chemicals during wastewater treatment. Effluent samples were collected from 33 sites alongside matching influent samples. Sample collection predominately occurred during the Australian Census in August 2016, which allowed for accurate per capita normalisation of the results. A subset of sites was also sampled over the Southern Hemisphere summer (December-February) period. Five UV filters were detected with at least one detected in 95% of effluent samples. The summed concentration of UV filters ranged from 130 ng L-1 to 8400 ng L-1 and averaged 2800 (+/- 1900) ng L-1. Of the target UV filters, 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA) and benzophenone 4 (BP4) showed the lowest removal efficiencies (11 +/- 36% and 51 +/- 43%, respectively) across all sites and were the most abundant in effluent. Average estimated removal efficiencies of the other compounds were between 59 (+/- 24) % (4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC)) and 74 (+/- 22) % (benzophenone 1 (BP1)). We did not find a trend in seasonal differences in the per capita release of UV filters in effluent samples. We estimate that approximately 40% of UV filter loads measured in influent are breaking through to the effluent resulting in the release of approximately 20 kg day(-1) of the selected UV filters into the aquatic environment from treated wastewater effluent in Australia.

AB Background As a class of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), illicit drugs should be taken into account in the water management because of their social and public health risks. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are usually considered as the source and sink of contaminants, and drug residues are observed in their effluents due to the inefficient removal of CECs. In this study, wastewater samples were collected from eight WWTPs in Changzhou City for assessment of the abuse of 12 illicit drugs in the city by wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) method. Results Drug concentrations ranged from < LOD-51.62 ng/L to < LOD-22.44 ng/L in influent and effluent samples, respectively. The highest removal rate of drugs was 79.0% in the WWTP which used sequencing batch reactor activated sludge (SBR) process method, while the lowest was found in the WWTP using anoxic oxic (A/O) process (47.0%), indicating that the drug removal rates were closely related to the treatment techniques. WBE method was applied to estimate the population normalized illicit drugs consumption. It demonstrated that methamphetamine (METH) was the most abused drug in Changzhou City, ranging from 0.16 to 20.65 mg/d/1000 inh, while other target drugs ranged from < LOD-1.52 mg/d/1000 inh. Consumption of cocaine (COC) and ecstasy was very low among the samples. Conclusion Overall, this research suggests that drug removal rates varied in different WWTPs and the SBR process is the best for removing illicit drugs. All target drugs were incompletely removed in wastewater treatment plants. WBE can be readily used to monitor the abuse of drugs in those regions, compared with traditional monitoring models.

AB The presence of antibiotics in the environment can threaten the ecosystem. The current work was an aim to degrade the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) antibiotic from the aqueous solution and hospital wastewater by the photo-Fenton process. The experiments were carried out in a quartz reactor and effects of operational parameters such as pH, H2O2:Fe2+ ratio, reaction time, and SMX antibiotic concentration were evaluated. After optimizing the parameters, the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process was tested for eliminating SMX from the hospital wastewater. The optimal conditions for SMX removal by the photo-Fenton process were obtained at pH 3, H2O2:Fe2+ ratio of 11:2, the initial SMX concentration of 25 mg/L, and the reaction time of 15 min. At optimized conditions, the removal efficiency of the SMX and chemical oxygen demand was attained 98.06% and 87.65%, respectively. The efficiency of the photo-Fenton system for removing SMX antibiotics from the hospital wastewater was obtained 67.42%. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model was well fitted the data for SMX removal using the photo-Fenton process. Accordingly, the photo-Fenton process is an effective method for removing SMX antibiotics from aqueous solutions and hospital wastewaters.

AB This work describes a systematic approach to the development of a method for simultaneous determination of three classes of veterinary antibiotics in the suspended solids (SS) of swine wastewater, including five sulfonamides, three tetracyclines and one macrolide (tiamulin). The entire procedures for sample pretreatment, ultrasonic extraction (USE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) quantification were examined and optimized. The recovery efficiencies were found to be 76%-104% for sulfonamides, 81%-112% for tetracyclines, and 51%-64% for tiamulin at three spiking levels. The intra-day and inter-day precisions, as expressed by the relative standard deviation (RSD), were below 17%. The method detection limits (MDLs) were between 0.14 and 7.14 mu g/kg, depending on a specific antibiotic studied. The developed method was applied to field samples collected from three concentrated swine feeding plants located in Beijing, Shanghai and Shandong province of China. All the investigated antibiotics were detected in both SS and liquid phase of swine wastewater, with partition coefficients (logK(d)) ranging from 0.49 to 2.30. This study demonstrates that the SS can not be ignored when determining the concentrations of antibiotics in swine wastewater.

AB Due to complexity and variety of pharmaceutical wastewater composition, little is known as for functionally important microflora of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (pWWTPs). We compared bacterial composition and diversity of pWWTPs (27 sludge samples collected from 12 full-scale pWWTPs) with those of other industrial (iWWTPs) (27 samples) and municipal wastewater treatment plants (mWWTPs) (27 samples) through meta-analysis based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and identified putatively important organisms and their ecological correlations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that the pWWTPs, iWWTPs and mWWTPs showed distinctive differences in bacterial community composition (P < 1e-04), and the pWWTPs had significantly lower bacterial diversity than the mWWTPs (P < 1e-06). Thermotogae and Synergistetes phyla only strictly dominated in the pWWTPs, and 26, 30 and 6 specific genera were identified in the pWWTPs, mWWTPs and iWWTPs, respectively. Totally, 15 and 1300 OTUs were identified as core and occasional groups, representing 23.2% and 66.2% of the total read abundance of the pWWTPs, respectively. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the bacterial components were clearly clustered corresponding to the types of pharmaceutical wastewater, and a total of 129 local specific OTUs were identified in the pWWTPs, among which anticancer antibiotics pWWTPs had the highest number of specific OTUs (40 ones). Co-occurrence network revealed that the species dominating in the same type of pWWTPs tended to co-occur much more frequently than theoretical random expectation. The results may extend our knowledge regarding the ecological status and correlation of the key microflora in pWWTPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elevated concentrations and potential toxicities of antibiotics in swine wastewater prompt the exploration of effective treatment methods to minimize the amount of antibiotics released to the environment. This study examined the technical and economic feasibility of using combined biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes for swine wastewater treatment. The up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was mainly responsible for conventional organic pollutant removal (i.e., a COD removal rate of 75%). The subsequent sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under a short sludge retention time (SRT) of 3 days removed the biodegradable antibiotics by >95%, and hindered the nitrification process which retained NW; -N and reduced operational cost (since the treated wastewater was intended to be used as a farm fertilizer). The subsequent Fenton-like oxidation (with the aid of citric add) achieved an average antibiotic removal efficiency of 74% under optimal reaction conditions: H2O2 dosage of 2.9 mM, [Fe2+]: [H2O2] = 1:3, [CA]: [Fe2+] = 1:1, pH 6.0, reaction time of 120 min. The superior treatment efficiency of Fenton-like compared to the conventional Fenton (74% vs 5%) under nearly neutral conditions was attributed to the chelating role of citric acid with Fe2+/Fe3+, leading to the enhanced Fe2+/Fe3+ solubility and therefore the promotion of center dot OH formation. This hybrid process of anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation and Fenton-like oxidation should be suitable and cost-effective for the treatment of wastewater with abundant conventional pollutants and persistent emerging trace contaminants.

AB Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely consumed by humans as it possesses analgesic activities. A selective molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for ketoprofen was synthesized and applied as a solid-phase extraction sorbent. MIP was synthesized using 2-vinylpyridine, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), toluene/acetonitrile (9:1, v/v), and ketoprofen as a functional monomer, cross-linker, initiator, porogenic mixture, and template, respectively. The polymerization was performed at 60 degrees C for 16 h, and thereafter the temperature was increased to 80 degrees C for 24 h to achieve a solid monolith polymer. Nonimprinted polymer was synthesized in a similar manner with the omission of ketoprofen. Characterization with thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction showed that the synthesized polymers were thermally stable and amorphous. Solid-phase extraction cartridges packed with MIP were used with high-performance liquid chromatography for quantitative analysis of ketoprofen in wastewater. The analytical method gave detection limits of 0.23, 0.17, and 0.09 mu g/L in wastewater influent, effluent, and deionized water, respectively. The recovery for the wastewater influent and effluent spiked with 5 a of ketoprofen was 68%, whereas 114% was obtained for deionized water. The concentrations of ketoprofen in the influent and effluent samples were in the ranges of 22.5-34.0 and 1.14-5.33 mu g/L, respectively. Overall, the analytical method for the analysis of ketoprofen in wastewater was rapid, affordable, accurate, precise, sensitive, and selective. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences.

AB In the current study, 43 pharmaceuticals and 18 transformation products were studied in the river Meuse at the Belgian-Dutch border and four tributaries of the river Meuse in the southern part of the Netherlands. The tributaries originate from Belgian, Dutch and mixed Dutch and Belgian catchments. In total, 23 pharmaceuticals and 13 transformation products were observed in samples of river water collected from these rivers. Observed summed concentrations of pharmaceuticals and transformation products in river water ranged from 3.5 to 37.8 mu g/L. Metformin and its transformation product guanylurea contributed with 53 to 80% to this concentration, illustrating its importance on a mass basis. Data on the flow rate of different rivers and demographics of the catchments enabled us to calculate daily per capita loads of pharmaceuticals and transformation products. These loads were linked to sales data of pharmaceuticals in the catchment. Simple mass balance modelling accounting for human excretion and removal by sewage treatment plants revealed that sales could predict actual loads within a factor of 3 for most pharmaceuticals. Rivers that originated from Belgian and mixed Dutch and Belgian catchments revealed significantly higher per capita loads of pharmaceuticals (16.0 +/- 2.3 and 15.7 +/- 2.1 mg/inhabitant/day, respectively) than the Dutch catchment (8.7 +/- 1.8 mg/inhabitant/day). Furthermore, the guanylurea/metformin ratio was significantly lower in waters originating from Belgium (and France) than in those from the Netherlands, illustrating that sewage treatment in the Belgian catchment is less efficient in transforming metformin into guanylurea. In summary, the current study shows that consumption-based modelling is suitable to predict environmental loads and concentrations. Furthermore, different consumption patterns and wastewater treatment efficiency are clearly reflected in the occurrence and loads of pharmaceuticals in regional rivers.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from the purchase and use of medications are recognized as ubiquitous contaminants of the environment. Ecological impacts can range from subtle to overt resulting from multi-generational chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple APIs (such as in the aquatic environment) or acute exposure to higher levels (such as with wildlife ingestion of improperly discarded waste). Reducing API entry to the environment has relied solely on conventional end-of-pipe pollution control measures such as wastewater treatment and take-back collections of leftover, unwanted drugs (to prevent disposal by flushing to sewers). An exclusive focus on these conventional approaches has ignored the root sources of the problem and may have served to retard progress in minimizing the environmental footprint of the healthcare industry. Potentially more effective and less-costly upstream pollution prevention approaches have long been considered imprudent, as they usually involve the modification of long-established norms in the practice of clinical prescribing. The first pollution prevention measure to be proposed as feasible (reducing the dose or usage of certain select medications) is followed here by an examination of another possible approach one that would rely on the excretion profiles of APIs. These two approaches combined could be termed eco-directed sustainable prescribing (EDSP) and may hold the potential for achieving the largest reductions in API entry to the environment largely by guiding prescribers' decisions regarding drug selection. EDSP could reduce API entry to the environment by minimizing the need for disposal (as a consequence of avoiding leftover, unwanted medications) and reducing the excretion of unmetabolized APIs (by preferentially prescribing APIs that are more extensively metabolized). The potential utility of the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) is examined for the first time as a guide for API prescribing decisions by revealing relative API quantities entering sewage via excretion.

AB In the present study, archived U.S biosolids from the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Sewage Sludge Survey were analyzed with an expanded U.S EPA Method 1694, to determine the occurrence of 26 previously unmonitored pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) among a total of 120 analytes. The study further served to examine the reproducibility of a mega-composite approach for creating chemical mass inventories in biosolids based on pooled samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) nationwide. Five mega-composites reflecting 94 WWTPs in 32 states and the District of Columbia were constructed from archived biosolids and analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS using a newly introduced analytical method expanding upon U.S EPA Method 1694. In addition, soil-biosolids mixtures from a mesocosm setup were analyzed to experimentally determine the half-lives of biosolids-borne compounds applied on U.S land. Among 59 analytes detected, 33 had been reported previously, whereas 26 are reported in biosolids for the first time, at levels ranging from 1.65 to 673 mu g kg(-1) dry weight. Newly recognized biosolids constituents were identified as Ca2+ channel blockers, antidepressants, diuretics, beta-blockers and analgesics. Using a mass balance approach, the total loading of these 26 pharmaceuticals to U.S soils from biosolids land application was estimated at 5-15 tons year(-1). Past and present datasets for 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were determined to be statistically indistinguishable (paired t-test; p = 0.01). This study expands the list of PPCPs reported in U.S biosolids, provides the first estimates of nationwide release rates to and environmental half-lives in U.S agricultural soils, and confirms the utility of using mega-composite sampling for economical tracking of chemical inventories in biosolids on a national scale.

AB Anaerobic digestion, the principal method of stabilizing biosolids in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), can efficiently and largely attenuate the antibiotic resistances in biosludge. This study aims to investigate the effect of oxidative pretreatment with ultrasound irradiation combined with ozone (US/O-3) on the mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD and TAD) for the biosludge bearing trace fluoroquinolones contaminants-levofloxacin (LEVO) which was widely used in recent years. During the oxidation, the trace-level LEVO was almost completely degraded. The methanogenic activity in US/O-3 pretreated TAD dosed 0.1 mg/L LEVO was much higher than those in single MAD and TAD, therefore leading to a remarkable increase in biogas production. The identification of levofloxacin intermediates during chemical degradation was analyzed using LCMS technique and the reaction pathway based on them was proposed. Hydroxyl radicals provided by US/O-3 contributed to oxidative ring opening of LEVO as well as degradation of other biomacromolecules in the biosludge. Besides, the quinoline resistance genes-qnrA and qnrS declined significantly by 1-2 orders of magnitude in US/O-3-pretreated TAD, indicating that the active radicals produced by US/O-3 oxidized and degraded LEVO and therefore inactivated the antibiotic resistant bacteria or genes in the biosolids. Meanwhile, the composition and structure of the microbial community altered and the diversity and richness of total bacterial and potential human pathogens decreased, the pattern of which was correlated with LEVO-resistant genes. Among the well-known AD-related phylum including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Methanobacteria as well as Thermotogae which has been previously detected in TAD and performed organic hydrolysis and degradation, the potential LEVO-resistant bacteria were probably affiliated to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Thermotogae. This study revealed the contribution of US/O-3 pretreatment to the anaerobic digestion in terms of ARGs reduction for trace-LEVO- exposed biosludge and could provide useful guidance for controlling the dissemination of ARB and ARGs in sewage sludge.

This paper reports the presence of 88 contaminants belonging to several chemical groups (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, disinfectants and pesticides), in river waters of the region of Madrid, one of the more densely populated areas of Spain. Three different monitoring campaigns were performed over a period of seven months. For quality assessment of river water analyses, an analytical protocol was developed employing a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method, followed by two methods based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (two LC-MS systems with ion trap and time-of-flight analysers) in order to carried out the unequivocal detection and quantification of the target contaminants. The method detection limits achieved were in range 0.1-60 ng L-1. Recovery values were higher to 70% for the most of the compounds and only two analytes (amoxicillin and tamoxifen) were not recovered with the SPE method applied. The results obtained during the monitoring campaign were classified in turn into two categories: contaminants in general called 'emergents', and priority substances or candidate pollutants from domestic and industrial activities. This classification allows us to evaluate the impact of both contributions, typically domestic and industrial, on the river waters. At the same time it enables us to get a first idea about the effectiveness of the urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that release the effluents to those rivers in eliminating or removing contaminants. The concentration ranges detected were between 110 and 9942 ng L-1 for emerging contaminants and 1 and 652 ng L-1 for priority or candidate pollutants.

AB Within the last decade, reproductive abnormalities have been discovered in wild amphibian populations of multiple species and in a variety of regions in North America. Predominantly, these field studies have focused on agricultural landscapes. In this study, we worked in suburban environments based on preliminary evidence showing that amphibian populations can display surprisingly high frequencies of reproductive deformities, including intersex traits. Here, we report results from 28 suburban ponds located near onsite septic systems as well as those located in sewered neighborhoods. Caffeine, an indicator of domestic wastewater contamination, was detected in more than 70% of all ponds; prevalence of contamination was indistinguishable for ponds in sewered neighborhoods and those served by onsite septic systems. Among green frogs (Rana (=Lithobates) clamitans) collected from the same ponds, intersex was detected in each population; on average, one male in five showed evidence of intersex. This frequency was insensitive to wastewater treatment mode. Given prior findings that intersex is absent or rare in less developed landscapes, our results suggest that domestic wastewater contamination in suburban contexts may be more widespread than is generally appreciated and should be investigated as a contributor to intersex in wild amphibians. This hypothesis is consistent with abundant prior research on wild riverine and estuarine fish populations associating reproductive deformities with wastewater exposure.

AB A submerged membrane photocatalytic reactor (SMPR) was constructed for the advanced treatment of p-nitrophenol (PNP) wastewater and rapid recycling of powdery catalyst, including a suspended photocatalytic system and a submerged microfiltration (MF) membrane system. To evaluate the performance of the SMPR, a visible-light responsive Fe(III)-ZnS/g-C3N4 photo-Fenton catalyst was successfully synthesized by the microwave hydrothermal method, and several techniques were used to characterize the resulting catalyst. The key operation factors on the wastewater treatment efficiency were successively optimized. When the influent PNP concentration was 10 mg.L-1, initial pH was 5, catalyst dosage was 1.0 g.L-1, H2O2 concentration was 170 mg.L-1, aeration rate was 0.50 m(3).h(-1), and operation time was 4 h, the PNP removal rate was 91.6% by the SMPR under simulated solar light irradiation. The rejection rate of the catalyst by the MF membrane was 100%, which realized the rapid separation and recycling of the suspended catalyst powders and avoided the catalyst loss and secondary pollution. The toxicity calculation results of PNP and its possible degradation products indicated that the toxicity of PNP wastewater decreased overall after the visible-light-driven photo-Fenton reactions. This study provided a combined photocatalysis-membrane filtration process that had a high treatment efficiency of refractory wastewater and solved the problem about the separation and recycling of the powdery catalyst synchronously.

AB During the rejection of trace pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewater by forward osmosis (FO), disposal of the FO concentrate was still an unsolved issue. In this study, by integrating the advantages of forward osmosis and electrochemical oxidation, a forward osmosis process with the function of electrochemical oxidation (FOwEO) was established for the first time to achieve the aim of rejection of trace antibiotics from wastewater and treatment of the concentrate at the same time. Results demonstrated that FOwEO (current density J = 1 mA cm(-2)) exhibited excellent rejections of antibiotics (>98%) regardless of different operation conditions, and above all, antibiotics in the concentrate were well degraded (>99%) at the end of experiment (after 3 h). A synergetic effect between forward osmosis and electrochemical oxidation was observed in FOwEO, which lies in that antibiotic rejections by FO were enhanced due to the degradation of antibiotics in the concentrate, while the electrochemical oxidation capacity was improved in the FOwEO channel, of which good mass transfer and the assist of indirect oxidation owing to the reverse NaCl from draw solution were supposed to be the mechanism. This study demonstrated that the FOwEO has the capability to thoroughly remove trace antibiotics from wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sorption and leaching potential of ibuprofen, estrone and 17 beta estradiol were tested in two agricultural soils: one irrigated using municipal wastewater and the other used in rainfed agriculture. Batch sorption-desorption experiments and undisturbed soil column assays were carried out using both soils to which were added a mixture of the target compounds. The three compounds were sorbed to a different extent by both soils: estrone > 17 beta estradiol > ibuprofen. Higher sorption was observed in the irrigated soil, which was attributed to the accumulation of organic matter caused by wastewater irrigation. Desorption of hormones was hysteretic in the irrigated soil, while ibuprofen showed low hysteresis in both soils. Retardation of the compounds' displacement was consistent with the sorption pattern observed in the batch tests. Retardation factor (R-F) was similar for the three compounds in the two tested soils, indicating that the target compounds are much more mobile in the soil columns than would be predicted based on their equilibrium sorption parameters. The results obtained in the experiments clarify the role of wastewater irrigated soils as a filter and degradation media for the target micropollutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid wastewater treatment process with combined attached biofilm (moving bed biofilm reactor) and activated sludge, named as Hybas (TM), was implemented for the treatment of municipal wastewater. The system consisted of six staged reactors in series including pre-denitrification and nitrification in the Hybas (TM) line and post-denitrification in a pure MBBR. In addition to the significant removal of nutrients and organic matter from municipal wastewater, Hybas (TM) also showed removal capacity for pharmaceuticals. Of particular interest was the enhanced removal for pharmaceuticals (i.e. X-ray contrast media) compared to other biological systems. Spiking experiments showed that the maximum removal rate constants (k, h(-1)) for 10 out of the 21 investigated pharmaceuticals (including diclofenac) were observed to occur within the two aerobic Hybas (TM) reactors, operated in a flow-shifting mode that allows even biofilm growth of nitrifying bacteria. In total, 14 out of the 21 pharmaceuticals were removed by more than 50% during continuous flow operation in the all Hybas (TM) line and post-denitrification MBBR. The calculated and estimated removal contributions of pharmaceuticals by each individual reactor were also assessed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products and endocrine disruptors demonstrate huge potential to cause adverse ecological health effects at very low concentration in aquatic environment. There is a need to improve current purification technologies used in sewage and drinking-water treatment plants. This article aims at providing new insights into the recent development of natural and modified clay-based sorbents for the removal of aqueous contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The removal of six widely used pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, as well as endocrine disrupting chemicals - bisphenol A and a bactericidal agent, triclosan was examined by sorption onto eight adsorbents. Sorption was performed using natural and modified clay minerals - montmorillonite (Mt), vermiculite (VER), bentonite (B), kaolinite (K), commercial acid activated montmorillonites K10 and K30, and two carbonaceous-mineral nanocomposites, MtG5%T, BAIG3%C. This study showed that among the tested natural clays, vermiculite is the most promising sorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals in purification processes. Among the modified clay minerals, the best results were achieved for carbonaceous bentonite and two acid activated montmorillonites K10 and K30. However, the removal of acidic pharmaceuticals on montomorillonite K10 and carbonaceous bentonite was strongly dependent on the pH value. In the case of vermiculite and acid-modified montmorillonite 1<30, the sorption of the selected compounds was not significantly affected by pH, which is crucial in wastewater treatment. The sorption constant divided by the specific surface area (K-d/A) is proposed to assess whether the surface area or chemical properties of the materials control the sorption process. K-d/A values were relatively high in the case of vermiculite, so it should be noticed that individual and specific surface properties of vermiculite were of crucial importance for sorption.

AB The oxidative removal of a diverse group of trace organic contaminants from surface water and wastewater was evaluated using ozone (O-3) and O-3 combined with hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2). Target compounds included estrogenic and androgenic steroids, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Bench- and pilot-scale experiments were conducted with surface water spiked with the target compounds and wastewater effluent containing ambient concentrations of target compounds. Full-scale water treatment plants were sampled before and after ozonation to determine if bench- and pilot-scale results accurately predict full-scale removal. In both drinking water and wastewater experiments, the majority of target compounds were removed by greater than 90% at O-3 exposures commonly used for disinfection. Atrazine, iopromide, meprobamate, and tris-cliloroethylphosphate (TCEP) were the most recalcitrant compounds to oxidize using O-3, with removals generally less than 50%. The addition of H2O2 for advanced oxidation was of little benefit for contaminant removal as compared to O-3 alone. O-3/H2O2 provided a marginal increase in the removal of dilantin, diazepam, DEET, iopromide, and meprobamate, while decreasing the removal efficacy of pentoxifylline, caffeine, testosterone, progesterone, and androstenedione. In wastewater experiments, O-3 and O-3/H2O2 were shown to remove in vitro estrogenicity. Collectively, these data provide evidence that O-3 is a highly effective oxidant for removing the majority of trace organic contaminants from water.

AB To meet mounting water demands, treated wastewater has become an important source of irrigation. Thus, contamination of treated wastewater by pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and the fate of these compounds in the agricultural environment are of increasing concern. This field study aimed to quantify PC uptake by treated wastewater-irrigated root crops (carrots and sweet potatoes) grown in lysimeters and to evaluate potential risks. In both crops, the nonionic PCs (carbamazepine, caffeine, and lamotrigine) were detected at significantly higher concentrations than ionic PCs (metoprolol, bezafibrate, dofibric acid, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and sildenafil). PCs in leaves were found at higher concentrations than in the roots. Carbamazepine metabolites were found mainly in the leaves, where the concentration of the metabolite 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was significantly higher than the parent compound. The health risk associated with consumption of wastewater-irrigated root vegetables was estimated using the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach. Our data show that the TTC value of lamotrigine can be reached for a child at a daily consumption of half a carrot (similar to 60 g). This study highlights that certain PCs accumulated in edible organs at concentrations above the TTC value should be categorized as contaminants of emerging concern.

AB The aim of our research was to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry to some aquatic organisms. The toxicity of three 24h proportional samples of wastewater was determined with the acute toxicity tests using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and daphnid Daphnia magna. The inhibition of bacterial luminescence was measured after a 30 min exposure period and the immobility of daphnids was determined after 24 and 48h. The chronic effects on daphnid survival and reproduction were observed for three weeks.
   The toxicity tests indicated that all investigated samples were acutely toxic to the organisms, but in each sample the responses of bacteria and daphnids were quite different. Acute and chronic effects on daphnids were observed when testing the first sample of wastewater, but no influence on bacteria was determined. The second sample was acutely toxic to both organisms. The third sample was toxic only to bacteria, while no influence on daphnid survival and reproduction was found. The reason for the different toxicity of the samples lay in their compositions. The comparison between chemical analyses and toxicity data showed that for daphnids the main cause of toxic effects was zinc. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

AB Currently, antibiotics are widely used in clinics, graziery, and aquaculture. Antibiotics are prescribed to treat infections by bacteria and parasites; therefore, the industry generates significant quantities of antibiotics. However, a large amount of wastewater also gathers simultaneously, which contains high-level chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen pollutants that must be reduced to permissible standards before disposal. For this purpose, an industrial scale lincomycin production wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that employs physicochemical and biological processes for neutralization and subsequent removal of concerning pollutants is built. The WWTP consists of three types of bioreactors, including four hydrolysis acidification bioreactors (HAT), eight anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) bioreactors, and four aeration-oxic bioreactors (AOT). This study has been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the WWTP. The study data revealed removal of 98.9% of 28922.1 kg/d COD and 98.0% of 1557.8 kg/d NH3-N after treatment of wastewater in WWTP, thus matching the effluent criteria. The HAT, EGSB, AOT and physicochemical treatment accounted for 11.1%, 61.9%, 20.2%, and 6.8% of COD removal, respectively. The AOT bioreactors removed major amounts of NH3-N. The analyses of microbiota showed that diverse microbial species were harboring in the bioreactors, which could treat the toxic bacteria in the wastewater. Moreover, dominant microbes in these three types of bioreactors were significantly different and formed three clusters according to the network analyses. Several keystone species, found in the system, participated in the COD and NH3-N removal process, demonstrating the pollutant removal ability at the species-level. In summary, a lincomycin production WWTP exhibited good performance and efficiency for the pollutant removal. Microbiota and keystone species involved in the pollutant removal process were identified, which would help to discover the mechanism of pollutant removal and to improve the removing ability in future designs.

AB The presence of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria in aquatic environments has become a health threat in the last few years. Their presence has increased due to the presence of antibiotics in wastewater effluents, which are not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatments. As a result there is a need to study the possible ways of removal of the mixtures of antibiotics present in wastewater effluents and the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which may also spread the antibiotic resistance genes to other bacterial populations. In this study the degradation of a mixture of antibiotics i.e. sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin, the disinfection of total enterococci and the removal of those resistant to: a) sulfamethoxazole, b) clarithromycin and c) to both antibiotics have been examined, along with the toxicity of the whole effluent mixture after treatment to the luminescent aquatic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Solar Fenton treatment (natural solar driven oxidation) using Fenton reagent doses of 50 mg L-1 of hydrogen peroxide and 5 mg L-1 of Fe3+ in a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector plant was used to examine the disinfection and antibiotic resistance removal efficiency in different aqueous matrices, namely distilled water, simulated and real wastewater effluents. There was a faster complete removal of enterococci and of antibiotics in all aqueous matrices by applying solar Fenton when compared to photolytic treatment of the matrices. Sulfamethoxazole was more efficiently degraded than clarithromycin in all three aqueous matrices (95% removal of sulfamethoxazole and 70% removal of clarithromycin in real wastewater). The antibiotic resistance of enterococci towards both antibiotics exhibited a 5-log reduction with solar Fenton in real wastewater effluent. Also after solar Fenton treatment, there were 10 times more antibiotic-resistant enterococci in the presence of sulfamethoxazole than in the presence of clarithromycin. Finally, the toxicity of the treated wastewater to V. fischeri remained very low throughout the treatment time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A combined anaerobic anoxic aerobic reactor for the treatment of the industrial wastewater that contains nitrogen and complex organic compounds as well as its design procedure is presented.
   The purpose of our experiments was to find a simple methodology that would provide combined reactor design. The reactor is based on the combination pf anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic process in one unit only. It was found that the HRT even under 1 hour in the anaerobic zone Is long enough for the efficient transformation of complex organic compounds into readily biodegradable COD which is then used in dentrification process. In the N-NO3 concentration range 1.5-50 mg/l the denitrification rate could be expressed as half-order reaction when the CODrb was in excess. N-NO3 removal efficiency is controlled by the recycle flow from the aerobic to the anoxic zone. Nitrification rate can be expressed as first, half or zero-order reaction with respect to effluent N-NH4 concentration. Nitrification rate depends on the dissolved oxygen concentration and hydrodynamic conditions in the reactor.
   Case study for design of a pilot plant of the combined reactor for treatment of pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater is shown. Characteristics of pre-treated wastewater were: COD=200 mg/l, BOD5=20 mg/l, N-Kjeldahl=80 mg/l, N-NH4=70 mg/l, N-NOx<1 mg/l, P-PO4=5 mg/l. Legal requirements for treated wastewater were: COD=<100 mg/l, BOD5<5 mg/l, N-NH4=<1 mg/l, N-NOx=<10 mg/l. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of improving the quality and reducing the quantity of wastewater used to irrigate alfalfa. These effects were measured in terms of vegetative matter production and composition, and soil and leachate quality. The Tula Valley, which has been irrigated with wastewater from Mexico City for over 100 years, was used as a focus for the investigations.
   Greenhouse experiments were conducted using columns of soil and a crop of alfalfa. Two different water qualities were compared under three irrigation rates.
   It was found that with the current wastewater quality in the Tula Valley. it may be possible to reduce the application rate by 43% without negatively affecting crop nutrition. This would achieve a reduction in leachate organic matter by 35%, and leachate salts (Na, K) by 40%. After construction of the new treatment plant is completed, an intermediate irrigation rate would reduce leaching to the aquifer of organic matter by 45%, and salts (Na) by 25%, without affecting the productivity and quality of alfalfa, or the retention of nutrients and organic matter in the soil. The results of this exploratory study need to be confirmed and expanded on by land parcel trials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the removal efficiencies of 68 selected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) spiked in a wastewater matrix by ferrate (Fe(VI)) and further evaluated the degradation of these micropollutants present in secondary effluents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by applying Fe(VI) treatment technology. Fe(VI)treatment resulted in selective oxidation of electron-rich organic moieties of these target compounds, such as phenol, olefin, amine and aniline moieties. But Fe(VI) failed to react with triclocarban, 3 androgens, 7 acidic pharmaceuticals, 2 neutral pharmaceuticals and erythromycin-H2O.Thirty-one target EDCs and PPCPs were detected in the effluents of the two WWTPs with concentrations ranging from 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng L-1 to 1156 +/- 182 ng L-1.Fe(VI) treatment resulted in further elimination of the detected EDCs and PPCPs during Fe(VI) treatment of the secondary wastewater effluents. The results from this study clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of Fe(VI) treatment as a tertiary treatment technology for a broad spectrum of micropollutants in wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emerging contaminants are a global concern, as Directive 2013/39/UE shows. Given the possible consequences that may lead to the presence of these compounds in water resources, different proposals are being evaluated to avoid their discharge into the environment. This study focuses on the use of a biological and physicochemical combined treatment formed by a membrane bioreactor with an H2O2/UltraViolet (UV) advanced oxidation process coupled subsequently to degrade contaminants of emerging concern in real urban wastewater. The membrane bioreactor operated at 16 h of hydraulic retention time and 4,250 mg/L of mixed liquor suspended solids. Different hydrogen peroxide dosages (25, 50, and 100 mg/L) were tested in the photoreactor at 20 degrees C and the natural pH of the wastewater. Different initial concentrations of a mix of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and ibuprofen) were tested. Removal efficiencies obtained in the biological stage ranged from 66.23%-96.18%, 90.63%-100%, and 90.04%-96.48%, respectively. However, complete removal was achieved after the physicochemical stage when the concentrations of contaminants in the mix were similar to current concentration levels in urban wastewater.

AB BACKGROUND: L(+)-Lactic acid is used in the pharmaceutical, textile and food industries as well as in the synthesis of biodegradable plastics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different medium components added in cassava wastewater for the production of L(+)-lactic acid by Lactobacillus rhamnosus B 103.
   RESULTS: The use of cassava wastewater (50 g L-1 of reducing sugar) with Tween 80 and corn steep liquor, at concentrations (v/v) of 1.27 mL L-1 and 65.4 mL L-1 respectively led to a lactic acid concentration of 41.65 g L-1 after 48 h of fermentation. The maximum lactic acid concentration produced in the reactor after 36 h of fermentation was 39.00 g L-1 using the same medium, but the pH was controlled by addition of 10 mol L-1 NaOH.
   CONCLUSION: The use of cassava wastewater for cultivation of L. rhamnosus is feasible, with a considerable production of lactic acid. Furthermore, it is an innovative proposal, as no references were found in the scientific literature on the use of this substrate for lactic acid production. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In recent years, sludge generated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and solid waste from livestock being utilized is useful for circulation of nourishment in farmlands as recycled organic manure (ROM). In this study, we determined the residue levels and patterns of 12 pharmaceutical products generated by human activity in the ROMs produced from human waste sludge (HWS), sewage sludge (SS), cattle manure (CM), poultry manure (PM), swine manure (SM) and horse manure (HM).
   The kind and number of pharmaceutical products detected in ROMs were different. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) were detected at high levels in HWS and SS samples. In addition, the detection frequency and concentration levels of sulfonamides (SAs) in PM and SM were high. Moreover, high concentrations of chlortetracycline (CTC) were found in only SM. These differences reflect specific adherence adsorption of the pharmaceutical products to different livestock and humans. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of pharmaceutical products and fermentation levels of ROMs had significant positive correlation (r = 0.41, p = 0.024).
   When the fermentation test of ROM was conducted in a rotary fermentor in a lab scale test, the residue levels of pharmaceutical products decreased effectively except carbamazepine (CBZ). The rates of decrease were in the case of tetracyclines (TCs): 85-92%, FQs: 81-100%, erythromycine: 67%, SAs: 79-95%, trimethoprim: 86% and CBZ: 37% by 30 d. Pharmaceutical products that can be decomposed by fermentation process at the lowest impact of residual antibiotic activities may therefore be considered as environmentally friendly medicines.

AB This piece of research deals with the monitoring of a group of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the metropolitan area of Granada, a city representative of the South of Spain, in order to evaluate the environmental management of the wastewater system. With that aim, the spatial and seasonal occurrence and distribution of a group of ECs in groundwater, surface and irrigation water resources from the aquifer "Vega de Granada" (VG) have been investigated for the first time. A set of the most prescribed drugs in Spain (ibuprofen, loratadine, pantoprazole and paracetamol), a pesticide widely used in agriculture (atrazine) and a typical anthropogenic contaminant (caffeine) were included in the study. Water samples were taken from the metropolitan area of the city of Granada inside of the zone of the aquifer, from the downstream of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and from the two main irrigation channels where surface and wastewater are mixed before distribution for irrigation purposes in the crops of the study area. A total of 153 water samples were analyzed through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) throughout the study that took place over a period of two years, from July 2011 to July 2013. Results demonstrated the occurrence of four of the six target pollutants. Ibuprofen was detected several times, always in both channels with concentration ranges from 5.3 to 20.8 mu g/L. The occurrence of paracetamol was detected in rivers and channels up to 34.3 mu g/l.. Caffeine was detected in all the water resources up to 39.3 mu g/L. Pantoprazole was detected twice in the surface water source near to a WWPT ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 mu g/L. The pesticide atrazine and the drug loratadine were not detected in any of the water samples analyzed. These results show evidence of poor environmental management of the wastewater concerning the water quality of the aquifer studied. The groundwater sources seem to receive a very continuous input of wastewater due to leaks from the drainage and sewerage system. This input may increase during rainy periods when it joins the recharge flow. The relationship between ECs and surface waters can be observed by comparing the averages for the rainy period with those for the driest. The highest concentration of ECs in irrigation water sources were detected in irrigation period times, between March and July. In general, concentration of the ECs uncovered in this study are similar to those reported in water sources from developed countries and environmental interpretation suggests that waste water management should be improved in order to reverse the current situation.

AB The largest wastewater treatment plant in Jordan was monitored in the summer to determine the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Grab samples were collected from the influent and effluent of As-Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were utilized to determine the concentrations of 18 compounds of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The results showed that 14 compounds were detected in the collected samples from the influent and effluent of As-Samra WWTP. These compounds are 1,7-dimethylxanthine, amphetamine, acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cimetidine, cotinine, diphenhydramine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), morphine, phenazone, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, thiabendazole, and trimethoprim. However, four compounds were below the detection limit (<0.005 mu g/L), namely cimetidine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methamphetamine, and sulfachloropyridazine. Among PPCPs, the highest estimated average concentrations in raw wastewater were caffeine, acetaminophen, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, cotinine, and carbamazepine sampled during the summer, at an estimated concentration of 155.6 mu g/L, 36.7 mu g/L, 10.49 mu g/L, and 1.104 mu g/L, respectively. However, the highest estimated average concentrations in treated wastewater were for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, caffeine, cotinine, and acetaminophen, at 0.856 mu g/L, 0.096 mu g/L, 0.086 mu g/L, 0.078 mu g/L, and 0.041 mu g/L, respectively. In general, the results showed that some compounds in the collected samples of wastewater in Jordan have concentrations exceeding the values reported in the literature. The removal efficiency rates of 1,7-dimethylxanthine, acetaminophen, caffeine, cotinine, morphine, and trimethoprim were higher than 95%, while those of carbamazepine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole were lower than 22.5%. Moreover, diphenhydramine and thiabendazole had negative removal efficiency rates. The removal efficiency rates of the PPCPs in As-Samra WWTP were generally consistent with those of indicator compounds reported in the literature for conventional WWTPs.

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals worldwide coupled with modest removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants have resulted in the presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems globally. In this study, we investigated the environmental concentrations of a selection of 93 pharmaceuticals in 43 locations in the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak. The Baltic Sea is vulnerable to anthropogenic activities due to a long turnover time and a sensitive ecosystem in the brackish water. Thirty-nine of 93 pharmaceuticals were detected in at least one sample, with concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 80 ng/L. One of the pharmaceuticals investigated, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine, was widespread in coastal and offshore seawaters (present in 37 of 43 samples). In order to predict concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, a mass balance-based grey box model was set up and the persistent, widely used carbamazepine was selected as the model substance. The model was based on hydrological and meteorological sub-basin characteristics, removal data from smaller watersheds and wastewater treatment plants, and statistics relating to population, consumption and excretion rate of carbamazepine in humans. The grey box model predicted average environmental concentrations of carbamazepine in sub-basins with no significant difference from the measured concentrations, amounting to 0.57-3.2 ng/L depending on sub-basin location. In the Baltic Sea, the removal rate of carbamazepine in seawater was estimated to be 6.2 10(-9) s(-1) based on a calculated half-life time of 3.5 years at 10 degrees C, which demonstrates the long response time of the environment to measures phasing out persistent or slowly degradable substances such as carbamazepine. Sampling, analysis and grey box modelling were all valuable in describing the presence and removal of carbamazepine in the Baltic Sea. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a new clean-up and pre-concentration method based on disk solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed to determine multi-class pharmaceutical residues covering a wide range of polarities (logK(ow) values from -0.5 to 5.1) in water systems, prior to ultra-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analyses. Electrospray ionisation in positive and negative modes was used for the simultaneous determination of both acidic and basic pharmaceuticals. The performances of disk SPE and cartridge SPE were compared. The targeted pharmaceutical compounds list included bronchodilators, antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, a lipid-lowering agent, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Based on our results, the disk SPE demonstrated a higher sensitivity and recovery value and less analysis time as compared to the cartridge SPE method. The limits of detection (LOD) for the new method ranged from 0.02-3.2 ng L-1, 0.02-3.1 ng L-1 and 0.02-4.7 ng L-1 for tap, effluent and influent wastewater, respectively. The method's absolute recovery values ranged from 70% to 122% for tap water, 62% to 121% for effluent wastewater and 62% to 121% for influent wastewater, except for metformin in which the absolute recovery value was approximately 48% for all samples. Intra-day precision for tap water, effluent and influent wastewater ranged from 3-12%, 4-9% and 2-8%, respectively. The method developed was applied for the determination of targeted pharmaceuticals in tap, effluent, and influent wastewater from one hospital treatment plant in Malaysia. The results revealed that the highest concentrations of certain pharmaceuticals were up to 49424 ng L-1 (acetaminophen) and 1763 ng L-1 (caffeine) in the influent and effluent wastewater, respectively. The results also showed a variation in the treatment efficiencies for the hospital treatment plant from one compound to another. Nevertheless, the removal efficiencies ranged from 0-99%.

AB Denitrification is a potential strategy for nitrate removal from wastewater. This study reports the isolation of a novel bacterium Georgenia daeguensis ARB2 which has not been earlier reported for treatment of wastewater. ARB2 was isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater and optimized for growth and nitrate removal under conditions of 10 mM nitrate stress (140 -mgL(-1) NO3- - N). It can utilize nitrate as a sole source of nitrogen, exhibits highest growth and aerobic denitrification using glycogen + maltose as a carbon source at pH 7.0, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 34, temperature 30 degrees C, and shaking speed of 100 rpm. ARB2 removes 20% of the initial nitrate concentration of 10 mM in 56 h, and 40% of the initial nitrate concentration of 1 mM in 52 h. Further, the efficacy of strain ARB2 was tested on real contaminated waters and was found to successfully reduce nitrate levels in them. The findings suggest that Georgenia daeguensis ARB2 has a potential application for the alleviation of nitrate under aerobic conditions.

AB Hospital wastewaters are a main source of pharmaceutical active compounds, which are usually highly recalcitrant and can accumulate in surface and groundwater bodies. Fungal treatments can remove these contaminants prior to discharge, but real wastewater poses a problem to fungal survival due to bacterial competition. This study successfully treated real non-spiked, non-sterile wastewater in a continuous fungal fluidized bed bioreactor coupled to a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment for 56 days. A control bioreactor without the fungus was also operated and the results were compared. A denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing approach was used to study the microbial community arisen in both reactors and as a result some bacterial degraders are proposed. The fungal operation successfully removed analgesics and anti-inflammatories, and even the most recalcitrant pharmaceutical families such as antibiotics and psychiatric drugs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Long-term irrigation with untreated wastewater may increase soil microbial adaptation to pollution load and lead to enhanced natural attenuation. We hypothesized that long-term wastewater irrigation accelerates the dissipation of pharmaceuticals. To test our hypothesis we performed an incubation experiment with soils from the Mezquital Valley, Mexico that were irrigated for 0, 14, or 100 years. The results showed that the dissipation half-lives (DT50) of diclofenac (<0.1-1.4 days), bezafibrate (<0.1-4.8 days), sulfamethoxazole (2-33 days), naproxen (6-19 days), carbamazepine (355-1,624 days), and ciprofloxacin were not affected by wastewater irrigation. Trimethoprim dissipation was even slower in soils irrigated for 100 years (DT50: 45-72 days) than in nonirrigated soils (DT50: 12-16 days), was negatively correlated with soil organic matter content and soil-water distribution coefficients, and was inhibited in sterilized soils. Applying a kinetic fate model indicated that long-term irrigation enhanced sequestration of cationic or uncharged trimethoprim and uncharged carbamazepine, but did not affect sequestration of fast-dissipating zwitterions or negatively charged pharmaceuticals. We conclude that microbial adaptation processes play a minor role for pharmaceutical dissipation in wastewater-irrigated soils, while organic matter accumulation in these soils can retard trimethoprim and carbamazepine dissipation.

AB A lack of knowledge of the health and environmental risks associated with chemicals of concern (COCs) and also of their removal by advanced treatment processes, such as micro-filtration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO), have been major barriers preventing establishment of large water recycling schemes. As part of a larger project monitoring over 300 COCs, iodinated X-ray contrast media compounds (ICM) were analysed in treated secondary wastewater intended for drinking purposes. ICM are the most widely administered intravascular pharmaceuticals and are known to persist in the aquatic environment. A direct injection liquid chromatography tandemmass spectrometry (DI-LC-MS/MS) method was used tomonitor secondary treated wastewater from three major wastewater treatment plants in Perth, Western Australia. In addition, tertiary water treated with MF and RO was analysed from a pilot plant that has been built as a first step in trialling the aquifer recharge. Results collected during 2007 demonstrate that MF/RO treatment is capable of removing ICM to below the analytical limits of detection, with average RO rejection calculated to be greater than 92%. A screening health risk assessment indicated negligible human risk at the concentrations observed in wastewater.

AB Potable reuse of wastewater is expanding, and ozonation for water reuse is becoming more common, either as a preoxidant before membranes or as part of ozone/biological activated carbon (O-3/BAC) systems. However, previous research has demonstrated that ozone drastically increases the formation potential of genotoxic halonitromethanes (HNMs), including during O-3/BAC. Chloropicrin, the most common HNM, is synthesized by chlorinating nitromethane, suggesting that nitromethane may be the immediate precursor of chloropicrin, although nitromethane is unlikely to occur naturally in wastewater. We hypothesized that wastewater ozonation forms nitromethane, which would be the key intermediate toward HNMs. Ozonation of wastewater effluent was shown to form abundant nitromethane, which explained the majority (in one case, all) of subsequent chloropicrin formation. Next, we investigated a suspected category of nitromethane precursor: stimulant drugs, such as ephedrine and methamphetamine, and certain antidepressants. These drugs all feature N-methylamine functional groups, and certain N-alkylamines have been shown to produce primary nitroalkanes upon ozonation. Ozonation of N-methylamine drugs ubiquitously formed nitromethane, typically at >50% yield. Subsequent chlorination converted nitromethane to chloropicrin. The reaction mechanism was investigated to understand the variation in nitromethane yield between different precursors. These results suggest that nitromethane fate during reuse and nitromethane control should be investigated.

AB Per capita loads of six UV filters were estimated in wastewater influent samples from 36 wastewater treatment plants in Australia collected over a weekend period during the 2016 Australian Census. Of the analysed samples, 99% contained at least one of the target compounds. Phenyl benzimidazole sulfonic acid (PBSA) was the most prevalent (99%), followed by benzophenone 4 (BP4) (97%), benzophenone 3 (BP3) (87%), benzophenone 1 (BP1) (84%), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) (22%) and isoamyl 4-methoxycinnamate (IMC) (1.5%). The highest concentrations were 3780 and 5070 ng L-1 for PBSA and BP4, respectively. Total per capita UV filter loads in influent across all plants were calculated using population data from the Australian Census and ranged from 0.21 to 3.4 mg day(-1) person(-1). Notably, a relationship was found between latitude and total per capita daily mass load of UV filters with an increase in mass load from southern to northern catchments. Compared to international studies, mass loads were generally similar with higher loads of BP4 found in Australia. This study provides insight into the occurrence of UV filters in influent wastewater from across Australia and provides the first comprehensive nationwide baseline of UV filter loads.

AB The present study evaluated the efficiency of a high rate algal pond (HRAP) at pilot scale to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater, including UV-filters and parabens (10), benzotriazoles (4), antibiotics (15), anti-inflammatories (3) and other pharmaceuticals (3). A total of 35 compounds were targeted, of which 21 were detected in the influent wastewater to the HRAP. Removals (RE%) for pharmaceuticals were variable, with efficient eliminations for atenolol (84%) and sulfathiazole (100%), whereas the anti-inflammatories naproxen and ketoprofen were only partially removed <50%. Benzotriazoles showed elimination rates similar to those of conventional WWTPs, with RE% ranging from no elimination to 51% for the UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP3) and 100% for 4-methylbenzilidenecamphor (4MBC). Hazard quotients (HQs) were estimated for those compounds not fully eliminated in the HRAP, as well as the cumulative ecotoxicity in the resulting effluent. The majority of the compounds yielded HQs < 0.1, meaning that no environmental risk would be derived from their discharge. Overall, these results clearly indicate that HRAPs are a reliable, green and cost-effective alternative to intensive wastewater treatment, yielding promising results removing these contaminants.

AB A rapid and accurate ion chromatography (IC) method (limit of detection as low as 0.06 mg L-1) for fosfomycin concentration determination in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater was developed. This method was compared with the performance of high performance liquid chromatography determination (with a high detection limit of 96.0 mg L-1) and ultraviolet spectrometry after reacting with alizarin (difficult to perform in colored solutions). The accuracy of the IC method was established in the linear range of 1.0-15.0 mg L-1 and a linear correlation was found with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998. The recoveries of fosfomycin from industrial pharmaceutical wastewater at spiking concentrations of 2.0, 5.0 and 8.0 mg L-1 ranged from 81.91 to 94.74%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) from 1 to 4%. The recoveries of effluent from a sequencing batch reactor treated fosfomycin with activated sludge at spiking concentrations of 5.0, 8.0, 10.0 mg L-1 ranging from 98.25 to 99.91%, with a RSD from 1 to 2%. The developed IC procedure provided a rapid, reliable and sensitive method for the determination of fosfomycin concentration in industrial pharmaceutical wastewater and samples containing complex components.

AB The constant detection of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) in the environment demonstrates the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants to completely remove them from wastewaters. So far, many studies have shown the feasibility of using white rot fungi to remove these contaminants. However, none of them have studied the degradation of several PhACs in real urban wastewater under non-sterile conditions, where mixtures of contaminants presents at low concentrations (ng L-1 to mu g L-1) as well as other active microorganisms are present. In this work, a batch fluidized bed bioreactor was used to study, for the first time, the degradation of PhACs present in urban wastewaters at their pre-existent concentrations under non-sterile conditions. Glucose and ammonium tartrate were continuously supplied as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively, and pH was maintained at 4.5. Complete removal of 7 out of the 10 initially detected PhACs was achieved in non-sterile treatment, while only 2 were partially removed and 1 of the PhACs analyzed increased its concentration. In addition, Microtox test showed an important reduction of toxicity in the wastewater after the treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In semi-arid regions, treated wastewater reuse for irrigation is a common practice since wastewater is considered as a non negligible water resource in these areas. However, treated wastewater contains traces of organic compounds which may contaminate the receiving environment i.e. soil and groundwater. Some of these organic compounds have the ability to bind to estrogen receptor (ER) or dioxin receptor (AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor). The fate of these compounds in effluent reused for irrigation, irrigated soils and groundwater is not well addressed yet. In the present study, estrogenic and dioxin-like activities were studied in three media: i) effluents reused for irrigation, ii) soils samples collected from the reclaimed water irrigated plot during six month irrigation, and iii) groundwater sampled before and after irrigation periods. Effluents reused for irrigation exhibited ER and AhR activities at 38.5 +/- 9.9 ng estradiol-equivalent/L (ng E2-EQ/L) and 113.3 +/- 27.7 ng dioxin-equivalent/L (ng TCDD-EQ/L), respectively. Soils showed ER activity (0.05 ng E2-EQ/g) only after 4 months of irrigation. AhR activities detected in all soil samples have not changed during irrigation. In groundwater, ER activities were detected in two piezometers indicating transfer of some estrogenic compounds.

AB The sonochemical degradation of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in water and wastewater was investigated at ultrasonic frequency of 850 kHz. The effects of pH, initial concentrations, temperature, power and dissolved organic carbon were examined. The results obtained indicated that the rate of ultrasonic degradation of E2 and EE2 in water and wastewater is influenced by the pH, power, air sparging and the dissolved organic content of the aqueous solutions. Mass degradation rates of E2 and EE2 per kW ranged from 1.7 to 4.0 mg kW(-1) at varying process parameters. The degradation process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with rate constant of 1.71 x 10(-2) min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The value for activation energy (E-a = 15.21 kJ mol(-1)) obtained from Arrhenius-type plot, indicated that the ultrasonic degradation of steroid hormones is thermodynamically feasible, and does not progress only on radical reactions but other intermediate reaction processes. In wastewater, the higher dissolved organic carbon significantly reduced the effectiveness of degradation of the E2 and EE2 showing that ultrasound treatment will be more effective as a tertiary treatment option in wastewater applications.

AB Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment, especially in low- to middle-income countries. This study investigated the occurrence, relative abundance, and fate of eight antibiotics at each treatment stage in four domestic and four hospital wastewater treatment plants (dWWTPs and hWWTPs, respectively), as well as mass loadings into the receiving water environments in Bangkok, Thailand. Samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in hWWTPs than dWWTPs; approximately 60 times for influents and 10 times for effluents. Ciprofloxacin concentration increased in most dWWTPs, especially in the aeration unit and return sludge, suggesting that it predominantly occurred in the solid phase. Sulfamethoxazole predominantly occurred in the dissolved form, which is more difficult to degrade, and exhibited high concentrations in effluent. Moreover, antibiotic pollutant loadings were approximately 30-3,530 times higher from dWWTPs than from hWWTPs due to higher daily discharges from the domestic sector. These plants are a major point source of antibiotic residue release to aquatic environments; thus, their efficiency should be improved by incorporating advanced treatment processes to ensure effective removal of antibiotics.

AB The presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater effluent is a major concern to the scientific community. This research effort was aimed at investigating Fenton-like degradation of two EDCs 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The results of the study showed that E2 and EE2 were effectively removed by the Fenton-like oxidation process. Removal efficiencies of 95% and 98% at ferric concentration of 1 x 10(-3) M (58.6 mg l(-1)) were achieved for E2 and EE2, respectively. The kinetics of Fenton-like degradation of E2 and EE2 were adequately described by the pseudo second order kinetic model. Values of 27.8 and 22.5 kJ mol(-1) were obtained for the activation energy for E2 and EE2, respectively, from the Arrhenius-type plot, showing that the process does not just involve radical reactions but also intermediate reaction steps involving radical-molecule or ion-molecule reactions. The presence of high dissolved organics in wastewater significantly reduced the removal efficiencies. The reaction by-products for E2 and EE2 were more stable to the oxidation process and more readily biodegradable. Fenton-like oxidations therefore offers a promising alternative for the removal of these EDCs in wastewater treatment applications at the tertiary treatment stage.

AB Calcium-silicate mineral Polonite (R) and aluminum-based catalyst (AL-1010S), previously identified as promising materials for catalytic ozonation, were used as catalysts to investigate the impact of some operating conditions (ratio ozone feed concentration to catalyst load) and wastewater characteristics (chemical oxygen demand - COD and nitrite - NO2 concentration) on the disinfection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) during catalytic ozonation of wastewater. Tests conducted in synthetic wastewater using two different ozone gas concentration (4 and 8 g (nm(3))) and 6 different catalyst loads provided ratios of 0.08, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.32. Results from the experiments indicated that the ratio of 0.11 was optimal and reached residual disinfection below 2 MPN mL(-1) from the initial concentration of 5 +/- 2 x 10 (5) MPN mL(-1) and removal of atrazine (ATZ) above 80% from the initial concentration of 100 +/- 10 mu g L-1 for an ozone dose of 41-45 mg L-1. Catalytic ozonation with the selected materials enhanced disinfection and ATZ removal from synthetic wastewater (SWW) in comparison to non-catalytic ozonation by making the treatment performance less sensitive to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrite (NO2) in the matrix. Validation of the results in real wastewater effluents confirmed that catalytic ozonation enhanced disinfection. Catalytic ozonation using Polonite (R) and AL-1010S provided residual bacteria level of 0.6 +/- 0.42 MPN mL(-1) and 0.29 +/- 0.41 MPN mL(-1), while non-catalytic ozonation lead to an average residual bacteria level of 1.26 +/- 0.09 MPN mL(-1) for the same range of transferred ozone dose. However, under the conditions tested, a limited number of CECs were extracted at levels above the limits of quantification and further validation work required to evaluate the performance of catalytic ozonation for the removal of CECs.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and estrogens, are detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges. However, analytical monitoring of wastewater and surface water does not indicate whether CECs are affecting the organisms downstream. In this study, fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and freshwater mussels Pyganodon grandis Say, 1829 (synonym: Anodonta grandis Say, 1829) were caged for 4 weeks in the North Saskatchewan River, upstream and downstream of the discharge from the WWTP that serves the Edmonton, AB, Canada. Passive samplers deployed indicated that concentrations of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, an estrogen (estrone) and an androgen (androstenedione) were elevated at sites downstream of the WWTP discharge. Several biomarkers of exposure were significantly altered in the tissues of caged fathead minnows and freshwater mussels relative to the upstream reference sites. Biomarkers altered in fish included induction of CYP3A metabolism, an increase in vitellogenin (Vtg) gene expression in male minnows, elevated ratios of oxidized to total glutathione (i.e. GSSG/TGSH), and an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase). In mussels, there were no significant changes in biomarkers of oxidative stress and the levels of Vtg-like proteins were reduced, not elevated, indicating a generalized stress response. Immune function was altered in mussels, as indicated by elevated lysosomal activity per hemocyte in P. grandis caged closest to the wastewater discharge. This immune response may be due to exposure to bacterial pathogens in the wastewater. Multivariate analysis indicated a response to the CECs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Trimethoprim (TPM). Overall, these data indicate that there is a 1 km zone of impact for aquatic organisms downstream of WWTP discharge. However, multiple stressors in municipal wastewater make measurement and interpretation of impact of CECs difficult since water temperature, conductivity and bacteria are also inducing biomarker responses in both fish and mussels.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in the environment has been frequently confirmed and has been recognized as a potential threat to the environment. This paper describes an advanced wastewater treatment process based on the electrochemical oxidation of pollutants, and the development of a sensitive analytical method to monitor the analytes in wastewater samples comprised of solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. The analytical method was successfully validated and achieved low limits of quantification (2.5-12.5 ng/L).
   In our survey of some Slovenian wastewater samples, the occurrence of seven compounds from the list of ten monitored pollutants was confirmed and quantified. Bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and metoprolol were determined in every assayed sample, while diclofenac reached the highest concentration (2 mu g/L). Therefore, under laboratory conditions the degradation efficiency of investigated compounds by various electrode materials, including boron-doped diamond (BDD), mixed metal oxide (MMO), platinum electrode, and high voltage sparks (HVS) were tested. The applicability of methodologies was evaluated on a synthetic mixture comprised of eight frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals (bisoprolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fluoxetine, imatinib and metopro-lol) and two pesticides (atrazine, simazine). The BDD and MMO electrodes showed >85% degradation in 60 min of treatment for the majority of the compounds, while the platinum electrode and HVS revealed low overall degradation efficiency. In addition, the BDD electrodes demonstrated an operational efficiency up to 70% also in a complex matrix of wastewater samples.
   Based on our observations of the prototype electrolytic cell degradation efficiency of some pollutants commonly presents in wastewaters, one can assume that this new technology could be a viable and feasible option to upgrade existing wastewater treatment plants in order to achieve a significantly greater cleaning efficiency, and to lessen the ecological burden.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment has been a growing concern. However, there is little information on the concentration levels of pharmaceuticals in African countries. This indicates the need and the Importance to develop sensitive methods that can detect these compounds at trace levels (ng/L-mu g/L). This work reports on the development of solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-photo diode array (SPE-LC-PDA) analysis. The method was then applied for the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds (ibuprofen, fenoprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and diclofenac) in river and wastewater samples. The SPE recoveries obtained at 10 000 ng/L spike concentration ranged from 89-120% in distilled water, 79-110% in river water and 78-94% in wastewater. The LODs and LOQs ranged from 10.9-20.4 ng/L and 36.2-60.7 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals obtained in river water samples ranged from 60 to 32 900 ng/L; in wastewater they ranged from 70 to 66 900 ng/L. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals were detected in winter compared to the spring season.

Bacteriological contamination (coliforms,E. coli,E. faecalis) was assessed using membrane filtration. FiftyE. colistrains, the species of which was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis, were subjected to antimicrobial resistance tests using standard disk-diffusion method. Double disk synergy test was used to assess the ESBL production and PCR tests were conducted to detect the ESBL-conferring genes and evaluate the genetic diversity. A significant variation in the number of bacteriological indicators was observed both within and between the sampling sites, suggesting the effect of effluent from the STP, point discharge of household sewage and agricultural runoff on the water contamination. The resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate (90%) and ampicillin (36%) was most prevalent. Multidrug resistance was observed in 40% of strains but no ESBL-producing strains were observed phenotypically. However, the presence of three ESBL-determining genes (TEM,OXAandCTX-M) was detected in 24, 10 and 8% of strains, respectively. A number of factors caused considerable pollution of the river and numerous multidrug resistantE. colistrains were isolated.

AB In many aquatic environments, municipal wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) effluent discharges influence local hydrologic and chemical connectivity between the surface-water and adjacent alluvial shallow-groundwater systems. Fourmile Creek located in Polk County, Iowa received effluent from the Ankeny WWTF for nearly forty years before it was shut down in November 2013. The decommissioning of the municipal WWTF provided a unique opportunity to characterize the recovery from impacts of treated wastewater discharge on water quality at the surface-water/groundwater interface in a shallow, unconfined alluvial aquifer.
   Dissolved major element and trace element concentrations in Fourmile Creek surface water, hyporheic-zone water, and shallow, unconfined groundwater were monitored upstream and downstream from the WWTF discharge before and after the shutdown. Multivariate statistical techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) were used to differentiate source-water contributions, characterize elemental components, and describe surface-water/groundwater interaction dynamics. During the post-closure assessment, there was subsurface attenuation of wastewater constituents including Al. B, Cu, Gd, K, Mo. Na, P, Pb, Sb, and Zn. During the same time, groundwater concentrations increased for As, Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, SiO2, Sr, and U and represented a profile characteristic of the shallow alluvial aquifer. Hydrologic conditions transitioned from predominantly wastewater infiltration and hyporheic exchange before the WWTF shutdown, to predominantly discharge of native groundwater. Precipitation-driven streamflow events created fluctuations in the groundwater water-table elevations, resulting in variable contact between the saturated and unsaturated zones within the unconfined, alluvial aquifer and intermittent exposure to constituents stored in the sediments. The inorganic fingerprint of municipal wastewater was flushed relatively quickly (519 weeks) from the hyporheic zone indicating that processes like diffusion or sorption/desorption that might extend recovery may not be important for many trace elements in this system.

AB This work develops a halophilic biocarriers-MBR for saline pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. The system has effectively treated the ampicillin-containing saline wastewater for 32 days, when the ampicillin concentration is lower than 20 mg/L. The system can tolerate the saline organic wastewater with a reasonable biodegradability (removals of COD over 75%) when the ampicillin concentration is 50 mg/L. The system has a bad performance in biodegradation (COD removals around 60-70%) and fouled within 16 days at a high ampicillin concentration of 100 mg/L. At high transmembrane pressures over 30 KPa, some ampicillin molecules may permeate through the membrane causing decreases in the ampicillin removal. The concentrations of protein and carbohydrate in EPS and SMP have increased over time and with increasing the ampicillin concentration. The method of biofouling control in MBR for the ampicillin situations has been proposed based on monitoring the concentrations of EPS and SMP. The drying-assisted monitoring of membrane biofoulants has showed a better efficiency than the monitoring of transmembrane pressure for membrane anti-biofouling in the treatment of pharmaceutical saline wastewaters where a spectroscopic detection can be hardly applied. This work may benefit relative research works for the control of biodegradation performance and membrane biofouling to better treat saline pharmaceutical wastewaters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs), which receive wastewater containing extremely high levels of antibiotics, are regarded as potential hot spots for antibiotic-resistance development in the environment. Six sampling campaigns in six PWWTPs in Southeastern China were carried out to assess the prevalence and fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARCS). Different genes were monitored in different PWWTPs (PWWTP A: lincosamides; PWWTP B: aminoglycosides and macrolides; PWWTP C: quinolones; PWWTP D: macrolides and quinolones; PWWTP E: cephalosporins; and PWWTP F: quinolones and macrolides) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), according to the antibiotic type produced. The levels of typical ARG subtypes in the final effluents ranged from (1.03 +/- 0.91) x 10(1) to (6.78 +/- 0.21) x 10(7) copies/mL The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluents accounted for 0%-577% of influents to the six PWWTPs with a median value of 6%. Most of the ARGs are transported to the dewatered sludge, with concentrations from (138 +/- 0.21) x 10(5) to (6.84 +/- 0.43) x 10(10) copies/g dry weight (dw). In different treatment units (before/after biological units), a clear trend of proliferation or attenuation was not observed for the ARGs, aside from a strong attenuation in moving bed bio-film reactor (MBBR) in PWWTP C. Through correlation analyses, this study demonstrated that the bacterial abundance and antibiotic concentrations within the PWWTPs influenced the fate of the associated ARGs, and this was possibly related primarily to the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of corresponding ARGs. Macrolide ARGs, which tend to locate in plasmids and transposons, positively correlate weakly with total macrolide antibiotic concentrations but positively correlate strongly with 165 rRNA concentrations. Furthermore, ARC concentrations in the wastewater from fermentation were significantly higher than in the wastewater from chemical synthesis and preparation. This is the first comprehensive study on the behavior of antibiotic resistance genes under extremely high-level antibiotic selection pressures in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWVVTPs) in Southeastern China.

AB This work aims to study the use of a powdered activated carbon with magnetic properties as adsorbent to remove common pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment. This hybrid material was prepared from powdered activated carbon that was combined with iron oxide nanoparticles and was characterized by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. It was also assessed for its adsorption ability using ibuprofen and amoxicillin as model drugs. Under the tested conditions, adsorption equilibrium was reached at 160 min for both drugs, with removal rates of 95% for the former and 90% for the latter. Adsorption data were fit to several adsorption kinetics and isotherm models. The adsorption of ibuprofen seems to follow a pseudo-order n kinetics and fits best the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model, whilst that of amoxicillin shows best fits to the Bangham kinetics and Temkin isotherm models. The new adsorbent also proved to be efficient in an urban wastewater spiked with both drugs and to keep its adsorption ability upon regeneration by desorption.

AB The removal of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a tertiary treatment system was studied. The ecological risks of effluents from both secondary and tertiary treatment systems as well as excess sludge were evaluated. Primary treatment and ultraviolet light disinfection showed limited ability to remove most selected PPCPs. The combination of an anaerobic process and triple-oxidation ditches can eliminate DEET better than the anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process. Adsorption to sludge played a key role in the removal of triclocarban. Multistage constructed wetlands as a tertiary treatment efficiently removed caffeine and ibuprofen from wastewater and could decrease the risk of partial selected PPCPs. Selected PPCPs residues in excess sludge generally produced higher risks to the ecological environment than effluents from WWTPs.

AB Treated wastewater effluents are a source of emerging contaminants, including microplastics and pharmaceuticals, that impact rivers and streams. As microplastics are transported from wastewater treatment into the environment, pharmaceuticals can sorb to the surface and also be colonized by microorganisms. To investigate the microbial communities that are important in pharmaceutical transformation on microplastic surfaces, we used a culture-based approach with naproxen as the model pharmaceutical. Microplastic beads served as a solid substrate for delivering naproxen to anaerobic cultures inoculated with either anaerobic digester sludge or sediment from a wastewater-impacted river. After demonstrating naproxen transformation activity within the cultures, we separated the bulk liquid culture from the colonized microplastic beads and transferred them into separate bottles of sterile media amended with naproxen. Naproxen transformation occurred in cultures that contained microbially-colonized microplastics. Results from DNA analyses of the microbial community from each treatment demonstrated a different microbial community structure on the colonized plastic compared to that of the planktonic cells, thus illustrating a selection of the microbial community by the microplastics. These findings demonstrate that the microbial community attached to microplastic beads can continue pharmaceutical transformation activity when the microplastics are transferred to new media, thus serving as a model for the potential transport of pharmaceutical-transforming microbes from wastewater treatment to freshwater environments.

AB Hospital wastewater contains acetaminophen (ACT) and nutrient, which need adequate removal and monitoring to prevent impact to environment and community. This study developed a pilot scale vertical flow constructed wetland (CW) to (1) remove high-dose ACT and pollutants in hospital wastewater and (2) identify the correlation of peroxidase enzyme extruded by Scirpus validus and pollutants removal efficiency. By that correlation, a low-cost method to monitor pollutants removal was drawn. Plants, such as Scirpus validus, generated peroxidase enzymes to alleviate pollutants' stress. Results showed that the CW removed 3.5 to 6 logs of initial concentration 10 mg ACT/L to a recommended level for drinking water. The CW eliminated COD, TKN and TP efficiently, meeting the wastewater discharged standards of Thailand and Vietnam. By various multivariable regression models, concentrations of ACT in CW effluent and enzymes in S. validus exhibited a significant correlation (p < 0.01, R-2 = 68.3%). These findings suggested that (i) vertical flow CW could remove high-dose ACT and nutrient and (ii) peroxidase enzymes generated in S. validus, such as soluble and covalent ones, could track ACT removal efficiency. This would help to reduce facilities and analytical cost of micro-pollutants.

AB High electrical energy is required for the electro-Fenton process to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater. The aim of this study was to develop a novel and more cost-effective process, specifically a microbial electro-Fenton cell (MeFC), for treating PPCPs in wastewater. Acetylene black was selected as the catalyst for H2O2 electrogeneration and Fe-Mn binary oxide for hydroxyl radical production. In addition to lowering energy needs, the MeFC produced a maximum power density of 112 +/- 11 mW/m(2) with 1 g/L acetate as a representative substrate and 10 mg/L carbamazepine (CBZ) as a typical PPCP. Comparing with electro-Fenton process, the CBZ removal in the MeFC was 38% higher within 24 h operation (90% vs. 62%). Furthermore, the CBZ removal rate in the MeFC was 10-100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes. Such enhanced degradation of CBZ in the MeFC was attributed to the synergistic reactions between radical oxidation of CBZ and biodegradation of degradative intermediates. The MeFC provides a promising method to remove PPCPs from wastewater coupling with efficient removal of other biodegradable organics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB De facto potable reuse occurs when treated wastewater is discharged into surface waters upstream of potable drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) intakes. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges may pose water quality risks at the downstream DWTP, but additional flow aids in providing a reliable water supply source. In this work de facto reuse is analyzed for 2056 surface water intakes serving 1210 DWTPs across the U.S.A. that serve greater than 10 000 people, covering approximately 82% of the nations population. An ArcGIS model is developed to assess spatial relationships between DWTPs and WWTPs, with a python script designed to perform a network analysis by hydrologic region. A high frequency of de facto reuse occurrence was observed; 50% of the DWTP intakes are potentially impacted by upstream WWTP discharges. However, the magnitude of de facto reuse was seen to be relatively low, where 50% of the impacted intakes contained less than 1% treated municipal wastewater under average streamflow conditions. De facto reuse increased greatly under low streamflow conditions (modeled by Q95), with 32 of the 80 sites yielding at least 50% treated wastewater, this portion of the analysis is limited to sites where stream gauge data was readily available.

AB This work presents a study about the elimination of anticancer drugs, a group of pollutants considered recalcitrant during conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment, using a biological treatment based on the fungus Trametes versicolor. A 10-L fluidized bed bioreactor inoculated with this fungus was set up in order to evaluate the removal of 10 selected anticancer drugs in real hospital wastewater. Almost all the tested anticancer drugs were completely removed from the wastewater at the end of the batch experiment (8 days) with the exception of Ifosfamide and Tamoxifen. These two recalcitrant compounds, together with Cyclophosphamide, were selected for further studies to test their degradability by T. versicolor under optimal growth conditions. Cydophosphamide and Ifosfamide were inalterable during batch experiments both at high and low concentration, whereas Tamoxifen exhibited a decrease in its concentration along the treatment Two positional isomers of a hydroxylated form of Tamoxifen were identified during this experiment using a high resolution mass spectrometry based on ultra-high performance chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap detector (LTQ-Velos Orbitrap). Finally the identified transformation products of Tamoxifen were monitored in the bioreactor run with real hospital wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical products are a major group of chemical compounds that are continuously released into the environment. The primary pathway of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment is the discharge of wastewater effluents. The Psychiatric hospital of Montpon (Dordogne, France) operates with its wastewater treatment plant. We first evaluated the presence and concentrations of 27 pharmaceuticals compounds in these effluents. All of the 27 compounds were detected in these wastewater effluents at concentrations ranging between 37,500 ng L-1 (paracetamol) and 150 ng L-1 (citalopram). The aim of the study was then to evaluate the exposure effects of the effluents on cytochrome P450, GST, and MXR responses in Corbicula fluminea gills and digestive glands. Experiments on clams exposed during 1, 3, 7 14, and 21 days revealed a strong and continuous overexpression of mdr1 (multidrug resistant 1) gene expression in gills and transitory variations in pi-gst expression and GST activity. EROD activity increased also transitory after 1 day in the digestive gland of exposed clams. These results indicated that in the effluent, some molecules have undergone metabolism of phase 1 and/or phase 2.

AB This paper presents the results of application of TiO2 photocatalysis in advanced wastewater treatment to simulate the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (i.e., bisphenol A, nonylphenol, estrone, and 17 alpha-estradiol) and estrogenic activity from secondary effluents of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, aiming to evaluate the possibility of application of photocatalysis for advanced wastewater treatment. The removal efficiencies of alkyl-hydroxybenzene (bisphenol A, nonylphenol) by traditional process in wastewater treatment plant are more sensitive to temperature than steroid hormones (estrone, and 17 alpha-estradiol), resulting in a risk of effluent insecurity. All the targeted EDCs in secondary effluent could be totally degraded by TiO2 photocatalysis within 60 min except BPA (92% removal), following pseudo first-order kinetics. The estrogenic activity, expressed as the E2 equivalent concentration (EEQ), was also totally removed during the same process. The mechanisms for the photocatalytic removal of EDCs and estrogenic activity were proposed according to the experimental results. When EDCs reacted with hydroxyl radicals, aromatic rings were cleaved, resulting in a decreased estrogenic activity. The findings suggest that TiO2 photocatalysis is an effective method for removal of certain EDCs and estrogenic activity from secondary effluents and can be used for advanced wastewater treatment.

AB Diurnal variations in wastewater flows are common phenomena related to peak water use periods. However, few studies have examined high-resolution temporal variability in trace organic contaminant (TOrC) concentrations and loadings. Even fewer have assessed the impacts of a special event or holiday. This study characterizes the temporal variability associated with a major sporting event using flow data and corresponding mass loadings of a suite of prescription pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and illicit drugs. Wastewater influent and finished effluent samples were collected during the National Football League's Super Bowl, which is a significant weekend for tourism in the study area. Data from a baseline weekend is also provided to illustrate flows and TOrC loadings during "normal" operational conditions. Some compounds exhibited interesting temporal variations (e.g., atenolol), and several compounds demonstrated different loading profiles during the Super Bowl and baseline weekends (e.g., the primary cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine). Interestingly, the influent mass loadings of prescription pharmaceuticals were generally similar in magnitude to those of the illicit drugs and their metabolites. However, conventional wastewater treatment was more effective in removing the illicit drugs and their metabolites. Total influent and effluent mass loadings are also provided to summarize treatment efficacy and environmental discharges. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment cannot effectively remove tetracycline contained in wastewater, and environmental residues accumulate as a result of this condition. Existing methods use to address the high cost of wastewater treatment and other economic and effective means have been explored. Aerobic granular sludge technology is a newly developed potential biological wastewater treatment method, but the removal of tetracycline through this process is limited. Therefore, the collection of tetracycline-degrading bacteria as a biological fortifier is vital. In this experiment, 20 and 24 tetracycline-degrading bacteria are isolated from granular and activated sludge samples, respectively. Highly efficient tetracycline-degrading strains are selected. The effect of these strains on the degradation rate is investigated under the influence of different factors, namely, time, pH, extra carbon source, inoculum concentration of extra nitrogen source, and substrate concentration. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding for 16S rRNA and physiological and biochemical identification shows that two strains belonged to Achromobacter species.

AB A pilot-scale Study of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process ill southern Taiwan is presented in this paper. A 10 m(3)/day capacity MBR plant consisting of all aeration tank and a membrane bioreactor was installed to remove organic matter (measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD)). The performance of the MBR was monitored for a period of 140 days. The removal of COD was oil average over 95%. The effluent did not contain any suspended solids. During the 140 days of operation, manual cleaning was carried Out twice and chemical cleaning was carried out once, A natural logarithmic evolution of the viscosity with TSS concentration was observed. The results of SEM and EDX demonstrated that the fouling on the membrane outer surface was mainly due to microorganisms and/or the sludge physiological properties. The results indicated that the MBR system has potential as a means of treating high-strength and fluctuating strength wastewater with consistent performance.

AB The degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by the UV/H2O2 and UV/chlorine processes was compared at practical concentrations in simulated drinking water and wastewater. In pure water, the UV/chlorine process performed better than the UV/H2O2 process for the degradation of 16 PPCPs among the investigated 28 PPCPs under neutral conditions. Interestingly, the UV/chlorine approach was superior to the UV/H2O2 approach for the removal of all PPCPs in simulated drinking water and wastewater at the same molar oxidant dosage. The radical sink by oxidants and/or H2O was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher in UV/chlorine than UV/H2O2 in pure water. Thus, the UV/chlorine process was less affected by the water and wastewater matrices than UV/H2O2. In UV/chlorine, the concentration of CIO center dot was calculated to be similar to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of HO center dot in pure water, and the reactivities of CIO center dot with some PPCPs were as high as > 10(8)M(-1) s(-1). CIO center dot was mainly scavenged by the effluent organic matter (EfOM) with a rate constant of 1.8 x 10(4) (mg L-1)(-1) s(-1) in wastewater. Meanwhile, secondary radicals such as Br-center dot, Br-2(center dot)-, CIBr center dot-and CO3 center dot-further contributed to PPCP degradation by the UV/chlorine process in wastewater, whose concentrations were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in UV/H2O2. Compared with the UV/H2O2 process, the UV/chlorine process saved 3.5-93.5% and 19.1%-98.1% electrical energy per order (EE/O) for PPCP degradation in simulated drinking water and wastewater, respectively.

AB In the present study, a pilot-scale ozonation system was introduced as post treatment to reduce the pharmaceuticals and toxicity in the effluent of a pilot-scale Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor ( MBBR) treating hospital wastewater. The ozonated effluent was polished further by suspended biofilm carriers to remove biodegradable organic matter and toxicity generated from ozonation by-products. A laboratory ozonation system was used to mimic the experiments, which were carried out at the pilot plant so that the removal of pharmaceuticals in the pilot and laboratory experiments could be compared. Delivered ozone dose achieved 90% removal of pharmaceutical was obtained and it was normalised to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These normalised results show that trimethoprim was eliminated by ozone easier than other pharmaceuticals.
   Fluorescence was found to be highly correlated to the removal of pharmaceuticals, and fluorescence with a wavelength of 275 nm of excitation and 310 nm of emission had the closest correlation. After polishing MBBR was introduced into the ozonated wastewater, half of its protein-like fluorophore was removed.
   The toxicity of the hospital wastewater during MBBR treatment was measured by Vibrio fischeri, the inhibition of which decreased from 80% to 50%. By applying ozonation, this inhibition reduced to 20%.

AB Lab-scale photolysis, biodegradation and transport experiments were carded out for naproxen, carbamazepine and tridosan in soil, wastewater and surface water from a region where untreated wastewater is used for agricultural irrigation. Results showed that both photolysis and biodegradation occurred for the three emerging pollutants in the tested matrices as follows: triclosan > naproxen> carbamazepine. The highest photolysis rate for the three pollutants was obtained in experiments using surface water, while biodegradation rates were higher in wastewater and soil than in surface water. Carbamazepine showed to be recalcitrant to biodegradation both in soil and water; although photolysis occurred at a higher level than biodegradation, this compound was poorly degraded by natural processes. Transport experiments showed that naproxen was the most mobile compound through the first 30 cm of the soil profile; conversely, the mobility of carbamazepine and tridosan through the soil was delayed. Biodegradation of target pollutants occurred within soil columns during transport experiments. Triclosan was not detected either in leachates or the soil in columns, suggesting its complete biodegradation.Data of these experiments can be used to develop more reliable fate-on-the-field and environmental risk assessment studies.

AB Purpose Pharmaceutical residues in the environment can pose significant risks to ecosystems and human beings due to adverse pharma-specific effects. Existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies do not usually consider the use and end-of-life (EoL) phase of pharmaceuticals and thus exclude relevant potentially toxic emissions of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Therefore, a simplified inventory model for the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals is provided by estimating API flows and emissions to the environment. Methods Both the qualitative description of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals and the quantification of the flows within each life cycle phase are based on literature and expert knowledge. Existing approaches to determine the API emissions are adjusted to make them applicable in LCA. In addition, different uses and EoL scenarios (e.g. depending on the patients' disposal behaviour) are specified, and assumptions are highlighted. Finally, the model is exemplarily applied to the oral intake of ibuprofen to test its applicability. Results and discussion Eleven potential flows and emissions of an API are identified and quantified for different application forms (pulmonary, oral, cutaneous). The model is applied to ibuprofen where potential API emissions result from administered and unused products. Referred to the administered amount of ibuprofen (reference flow), the product is mainly metabolized (73.1%). The unmetabolized (parental) compound enters the sewage treatment plant where it is degraded (13.94%), or emitted to surface water (8.35%), air (0%) and sewage sludge (0.36%). The remainder cannot be clearly assigned to one of the flows (4.25%). The results of this example are hardly comparable to existing measured data because they are related to the functional unit. The effect of assumptions, limitations due to data availability and the geographic scope reveal the need for further research. Conclusions To facilitate the consideration of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals in future pharma-LCAs, a simplified inventory model specified for German conditions, is provided which allows to calculate inventory results with easily and publically accessible data. However, remaining challenges such as the lack of data to model the behaviour of metabolites in the sewage treatment plant, missing approaches to include specific pharmaceuticals (e.g. hormones, anticancer drugs), the consideration of other sewage treatment technologies such as ozonization, the integration of API emissions from sewage sludge (e.g. due to the use as fertilizer) or the scope expansion with regard to the geographic validity of the model shall be further examined.

AB This work assessed the behaviour of nine pharmaceuticals and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in demo-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB reactors) coupled to distinct simplified post-treatment units (submerged bed, polishing ponds, and trickling filters) fed on raw sewage taken from a municipality in Brazil. The dissolved concentration of the studied micropollutants in the raw and treated sewage was obtained using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis in a liquid chromatography system coupled to a hybrid high resolution mass spectrometer consisting of an ion-trap and time of flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). The UASB reactors demonstrated that they were not appropriate for efficiently removing the assessed compounds from the sewage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was an important parameter for the removal of the hydrophilic and less biodegradable compounds, such as trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The post-treatment units substantially increased the removal of most target micropollutants present in the anaerobic effluents, with a greater removal of micropollutants in simplified systems that require a large construction area, such as the submerged bed and polishing ponds, probably because of the higher HRT employed. Alternatively, compact post-treatment systems, such as trickling filters, tended to be less effective at removing most of the micropollutants studied, and the type of packing proved to be crucial for determining the fate of such compounds using trickling filters.

AB The present study evaluated the potential environmental concentrations of 4 cytostatic (also known as cytotoxic) drugs in rivers. The antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and its pro-drug capecitabine were examined based on their very high use rates, cyclophosphamide (CP) for its persistence, and carboplatin for its association with the metal element platinum. The study combined drug consumption information across European countries, excretion, national water use, and sewage removal rates to derive sewage effluent values across the continent. Results showed considerable variation in the popularity of individual cytostatic drugs across Europe, including a 28-fold difference in 5FU use and 15-fold difference in CP use. Such variations could have a major effect on the detection of these compounds in effluent or river water. Overall, capecitabine and CP had higher predicted levels in effluent than 5FU or carboplatin. Predicted effluent values were compared with measurements in the literature, and many non-detects could be explained by insufficient limits of detection. Linking the geographic based water resources model GWAVA with this information allowed water concentrations throughout 1.2 million km of European rivers to be predicted. The 90th percentile (worst case) prediction indicated that, with the exception of capecitabine, more than 99% of Europe's rivers (by length) would have concentrations below 1 ng/L for these cytostatic drugs. For capecitabine, 2.2% of river length could exceed 1 ng/L. (C) 2013 SETAC

AB Electrodegradation of simulated pharmaceutical wastewaters was performed and optimized according to response surface methodology. To this end, carbamazepine (CBZ) was used as a model compound and a design of experiments was planned for evaluating the influence of two main variables in the electrochemical process: initial CBZ concentration (in logarithm terms) and the current density. Target variable was an apparent first-order kinetic constant (k) designed ad hoc. Interaction of variables was confirmed and an optimum k constant of 0.72min(-1) was obtained. CBZ was also removed from real wastewater matrices, such as urban wastewater or surface water from river and lake.

AB The degradation of pharmaceuticals and toxicity changes in different aqueous matrixes treated by UV-C and UVC/H2O2 were evaluated. No pH influence (4.0, 6.0 and 7.0) on the degradation of the target compounds was obtained in deionised water for any target compound. Hydrochlorothiazide was the most easily photodegraded followed by naproxen and gemfibrozil. The matrix composition strongly decreased the rates and degradation efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals according to the following sequence: sewage treatment plant effluent > surface water > deionised water. In contrast, the addition of H2O2 improved the rates and degradation efficiencies when compared to the isolated use of UV-C. Better degradation efficiencies in deionised and surface water were obtained using 4 mg L-1 H2O2, and a 16-fold higher concentration of H2O2 (64 mg L-1) was required for sewage treatment plant effluent. Additionally, the sewage treatment plant matrix was the most strongly influenced by the addition of H2O2, which increased the degradation rates of gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen by 7.7-, 2.5- and 4.4-fold, respectively, when compared to UV-C. The acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri increased in the real matrixes due to the formation of toxic transformation products from natural organic matter as confirmed by control experiments using the matrixes in the absence of the target compounds. Overall, UV-C/H2O2 is useful for degrading target compounds in all aqueous matrixes, but an initial treatment step is recommended for the removal of the natural organic matter from real matrixes.

AB The use of Trametes versicolor has been partially successful in the removal of some pharmaceuticals from sewage sludge in laboratory-scale biopile systems. The application of two strategies for the re-inoculation of biomass was assessed during the fungal bioaugmentation of non-sterile sludge (42-d treatment) as an approach to improve the elimination of pharmaceuticals and other groups of emerging pollutants. Globally, the re-inoculation of biopiles with blended mycelium exerted a major effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals (86%), brominated-flame-retardants (81%) and UV filters (80%) with respect to the re-inoculation with additional lignocellulosic substrate colonized by the fungus (69-67-22%). The performance was better than that of the analogous non-re-inoculated systems that were assayed previously for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The results demonstrate the ability of T. versicolor to remove a wide spectrum of emerging micropollutants under non-sterile conditions, while re-inoculation appears to be a useful step to improve the fungal treatment of sludge.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical industrial wastewater contains a high amount of suspended solids and alkaline (pH > 8); therefore it requires approprite coagulant and flocculant compounds for its wastewater treatment. The most widely used flocculant is a synthetic that has certain problems such as non-biodegradability and releases of toxic residual monomers. The use of eco-friendly flocculants as alternative materials for conventional flocculant in water and wastewater treatments is increasing. Numerous factors influence the performance of coagulation-flocculation process, such as coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage, initial potential of hydrogen (pH) and velocity gradient of coagulation-flocculation. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the capability and effectiveness of Moringa oleifera extract for removal of suspended solid in herbal pharmaceutical industry. A coagulation-flocculation test was done by performing jar test at various speeds, according to the variation of the conducted treatment research. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) approach was used to optimize the concentration of coagulant dosage, flocculant dosage and flocculation velocity gradient (G), and the results were measured as maximum percentage of suspended solid removal. The wastewater used in this research originally came from the inlet of herbal pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant, which was collected over 3 days. The wastewater has a total suspended solids of more than 1250 mg/L, and was alkaline (pH 9-10). The moringa extract was made from the extraction of a fat free moringa powder with a salt solution in a certain ratio. The percentage removal of suspended solid was 93.42-99.54%. The final results of the analysis of response surface showed that the variables of flocculant dosage and the flocculation velocity gradient (G) have a huge impact on the amount of suspended solid removal, compared with the coagulant dosage. The model generated from the response analysis is a quadratic model. The optimum point of the removal suspended solid quadratic model is at 10.6566 mg/L alum dosage, 13.8185 ml/L Moringa oleifera extract dosage, and G velocity of flocculation 84.845 sec(-1).

AB Anaerobic treatment of wastewater and waste organic solvents originating from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries was tested in a pilot anaerobic membrane bioreactor, which was operated for 580 days under different operational conditions. The goal was to test the long-term treatment efficiency and identify inhibitory factors. The highest COD removal of up to 97% was observed when the influent concentration was increased by the addition of methanol (up to 25 g L-1 as COD). Varying and generally lower COD removal efficiency (around 78%) was observed when the anaerobic membrane bioreactor was operated with incoming pharmaceutical wastewater as sole carbon source. The addition of waste organic solvents (>2.5 g L-1 as COD) to the influent led to low COD removal efficiency or even to the breakdown of anaerobic digestion. Changes in the anaerobic population (e.g., proliferation of the genus Methanosarcina) resulting from the composition of influent were observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most important wastewater treatment processes is microelectrolysis, which is extensively used in the primary treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. In this study, microelectrolysis, as a pretreatment method for the refractory metronidazole pharmaceutical wastewater (MPW) of choice, was improved using the Fenton process and used to remove the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and improve the biochemical capability of MPW. The results showed that the highest COD removal of 40.8% was obtained in the presence of optimized significant factors and the BI (BI = biochemical oxygen demand over five days/COD) of MPW increased from 0.10 to 0.31. In addition, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy demonstrated that metronidazole in MPW was effectively removed during the combined processes. All these results showed that microelectrolysis combined with Fenton oxidation for MPW was an effective treatment process to achieve higher COD removal and biodegradability improvement. Finally, the breakthrough curves at different flow rates were measured to prove the feasibility of the combined process under optimal conditions.

AB A single-stage anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) process with an integrated biofilm-activated sludge system was carried out in a laboratory-scale flow-through reactor (volume = 57.6 L) to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing chlortetracycline. Partial nitrification was successfully achieved after 48 days of treatment with a nitrite accumulation of 70%. The activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) decreased when the chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of the influent was 3000 mg/L. When switching to the single-stage ANAMMOX operation, (T = 32-34 degrees C, DO = 0.4-0.8 mg/L, pH = 8.0-8.5), the total nitrogen (TN) removal loading rate and efficiency were 1.0 kg/m(3)/d and 75.2%, respectively, when the ammonium concentration of the influent was 287 +/- 146 mg/L for 73 days. The findings of this study imply that single-stage ANAMMOX can achieve high nitrogen removal rates and effectively treat pharmaceutical wastewater with high concentrations of COD (1000 mg/L) and ammonium.

AB In this study, iron foam combined ozonation was employed as an advanced oxidation process to treat the organic contaminants in real pharmaceutical wastewater. It was found that this procedure worked well in a wide range of pH, the existence of iron foam in ozonation system markedly elevated the mineralization level of organic contaminants. Within the reaction time of 120 min, iron foam combined ozonation achieved 53% of DOC removal percentage, which was 21% higher than that of ozone alone. Meanwhile, the biodegradability of the pharmaceutical wastewater was improved, a large part of the organic pollutants containing benzene rings and amino groups were effectively degraded, and a certain amount of phosphate and nitrogen also get removed. In iron foam combined ozonation, zero valent iron played the role as an activator. It was oxidized into iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, the electrons transferring among different valences of iron stimulated the decomposition of ozone and the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which accounted for most of the organic contaminants degradation.

AB Herbal Pharmaceutical wastewater was subjected to physico-chernical treatment using conventional coagulants individually and in combination with different anionic, cationic and nonionic polyelectrolytes. Results indicate cationic polyelectrolyte to be the best polymer. Individually Alum did not give good results but Alum with cationic polymer in the ratio of 300:0.25 mg l(-1) resulted in the best removals of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Solids (SS) of 64.0%, 69.4% and 80.82% respectively. The next combination which resulted in good removals was Lime: cationic polymer in the ratio of 300:0.20 mg l(-1) with COD, BOD, and SS removals of 57.6%, 65.1% and 74.0%, respectively. Overall the studies indicated that the herbal pharmaceutical wastewater needs to be treated by physico-chemical treatment as a primary process to reduce the organic load and increase the performance efficiency of the secondary biological treatment process. This paper discusses in detail the studies carried out using conventional coagulants along with synthetic polyelectrolyte.

AB To observe the effect of aeration strategies on the dissipation of fluoroquinolones (FQs) during aerobic composting and explore their dissipation pathways, 60-L composting and 0.5-L incubation experiments were carried out in this study. Three aeration strategies (windrow, static aeration, feedback aeration) were applied to remove two typical FQs (Norfloxacin (NOR) and Ofloxacin (OFL)) during the 60-L composting of sewage sludge with 5 mg kg(-1) of FQs added. Then, three 0.5 L-sample groups were taken during the three phases of the 60-L composting matrixes without FQs under static aeration, and were inoculated separately at 35 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 40 degrees C after being added with 5 mg kg(-1) of FQs. In each group, incubation was carried out for three treatments (sterilization + no aeration, sterilization + aeration, and no sterilization + aeration). The FQs in the sewage sludge were mainly removed in the mesophilic and thermophilic phases in all the aeration strategies. The removal efficiencies were high for the whole process: 89.6-95.4% for NOR and 87.2-95.4% for OFL. The order of removal efficiency of FQs was static aeration > feedback aeration > windrow. The combination of composting phases facilitated to the rapid dissipation of FQs, which reduced the half-life to about 1/6 to 1/5 of the values in each phase. In the mesophilic and thermophilic compost, biodegradation was the main pathway for the dissipation of FQs followed by irreversible adsorption. Irreversible adsorption and biodegradation provided similar removal efficiencies for the curing compost. The volatilization of FQs was non-negligible in all phases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigates the oxidation of selected endocrine disrupting compounds (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) during ozonation and advanced oxidation of biologically treated municipal wastewater effluents in a pilot scale. Selected estrogenic substances were spiked in the treated wastewater at levels ranging from 1.65 to 3.59 mu g.L-1. All estrogens were removed by ozonation by more than 99% at ozone doses >= 1.8 mg.L-1. At a dose of 4.4.mg L-1 ozonation reduced concentrations of estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol by 99.8, 99.7, 99.9 and 99.7%, respectively. All tested advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) achieved high removal rates but they were slightly lower compared to ozonation. The lower removal rates for all tested advanced oxidation processes are caused by the presence of naturally occurring hydroxyl radical scavengers carbonates and bicarbonates.

AB Artificial sweeteners are gaining acceptance as tracers of human wastewater in the environment. The 3 artificial sweeteners analyzed in this study were detected in leachate or leachate-impacted groundwater at levels comparable to those of untreated wastewater at 14 of 15 municipal landfill sites tested, including several closed for >50 years. Saccharin was the dominant sweetener in old (pre-1990) landfills, while newer landfills were dominated by saccharin and acesulfame (introduced 2 decades ago; dominant in wastewater). Cyclamate was also detected, but less frequently. A case study at one site illustrates the use of artificial sweeteners to identify a landfill-impacted groundwater plume discharging to a stream. The study results suggest that artificial sweeteners can be useful tracers for current and legacy landfill contamination, with relative abundances of the sweeteners potentially providing diagnostic ability to distinguish different landfills or landfill cells, including crude age-dating, and to distinguish landfill and wastewater sources.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are increasingly being reported in wastewater effluents and surface waters around the world. The presence of these products, designed to modulate human physiology and behaviour, has created concern over whether PhACs similarly affect aquatic organisms. Though laboratory studies are beginning to address the effects of individual PhACs on fish behaviour, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on fish behaviour. In this study, we exposed a wild, invasive fish species-the round goby (Neogobiusmelanostomus)-to treated wastewater effluent (0%, 50% or 100% effluent dilutions) for 28 days. We then determined the impact of exposure on fish aggression, an important behaviour for territory acquisition and defense. We found that exposure to 100% wastewater effluent reduced the number of aggressive acts that round goby performed. We complimented our behavioural assay with measures of pharmaceutical uptake in fish tissues. We detected 11 of 93 pharmaceutical compounds that we tested for in round goby tissues, and we found that concentration was greatest in the brain followed by plasma, then gonads, then liver, and muscle. Fish exposed to 50% and 100% effluent had higher tissue concentrations of pharmaceuticals and concentrated a greater number of pharmaceutical compounds compare to control fish exposed to no (0%) effluent. Exposed fish also showed increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, suggesting that fish were exposed to planar halogenated/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHHs/PAHs) in the wastewater effluent. Our findings suggest that fish in effluent-dominated systems may have altered behaviours and greater tissue concentration of PhACs. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of characterizing exposure to multiple pollutants, and support using behaviour as a sensitive tool for assessing animal responses to complex contaminant mixtures, like wastewater effluent.

AB Environmental protection is one of the today's most important concerns, therefore, firms are expected to reduce their environmental loads continuously whilst enhancing their productivity. In our study, a procedure was developed to manage the wastewater of a pharmaceutical process. The parameters of the wastewater, which flows into the sewerage system, are generally below the permitted threshold values, but occasionally exceed the limits. To improve this situation, online measuring equipment was deployed to estimate chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) on the basis of the sugar content of an aqueous solution (BRIX) refractometric method. A mathematical model was developed for data processing and a control module was designed for the decisions. The measuring module was tested for 45 d. The data received were used for testing and monitoring the control module. During the test period it was found that the volume of the water requiring transfer for CODcr removal fell by 50%, whilst no water with parameters above the threshold value flowed into the sewerage system.

AB Separation of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater by nanofiltration (NF) membrane has been investigated in this study. For this purpose a membrane system including a polyamide spiral wound NF membrane was evaluated for the treatment of amoxicillin wastewater. The effects of operating conditions such as flow rate, pressure and concentration of amoxicillin and COD in the feed, on the efficiency of the membrane were evaluated. The permeation flux and rejection of amoxicillin and COD were the criteria for this evaluation. The rejection of the amoxicillin by the selected NF membrane was adequate and in most cases exceeded 97% whereas COD reached a maximum of 40% rejection and permeation flux was over 1.5 L/min.m(2). The rise in pressure enhanced the transport rate of the solvents. Permeation flux of the NE membrane increased with increasing flow rates. Experimental data also indicated that concentration polarization existed in this membrane separation process. The stable permeation flux and high rejection of amoxicillin indicated the potential of NF for the recovery of amoxicillin from the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Effects of a chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater on performance of an anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), activity of acetoclastic methanogens and microbial composition were evaluated under various influent compositions. Initially, the CSTR was fed with glucose up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 6 kg COD/m(3) (.) d corresponding to an F/M ratio of 0.43 with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 days. A COD removal efficiency of 92% and a methane yield of 0.32 m(3) CH4/kg CODremoved were achieved whilst specific methanogenic activity (SMA) was found to be 336 mL CH4/gTVS (.) d. After the CSTR was fed with pre-aerated wastewater diluted by glucose in different dilution ratios of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v), 70% (w/v), and 100% (w/v) pre-aerated wastewater, gradual decreases in COD removal efficiency to 71%, methane yield to 0.28 m(3) CH4/kg CODremoved and SMA to 166 mL CH4/gTVS (.) d occurred whilst volatile fatty acid concentration reached to 1474 mg/L. After the raw wastewater diluted with the pre-aerated wastewater was fed into the CSTR in increasing ratios of 10% (w/v), 30% (w/v), and 60% (w/v), there was a proportional deterioration in performance in terms of COD removal efficiency, methane yield and acetoclastic methanogenic activity. Epifluorescence microscopy of the seed sludge revealed that Methanococcus-like species, short, and medium rods were found to be equally dominant. The short and medium rod species remained equally dominant groups in the CSTR throughout the feeding regime whilst Methanococcus-like species and long rods were found to be in insignificant numbers at the end of the study. Changes in archael diversity were determined using molecular analyses such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and denaturent gradient gel clectrophoresis (DGGE). Results showed that overall archeal diversity did not change much whereas changes in composition of eubacterial population occurred.

AB Pharmaceuticals for human use are consumed in significant quantities and their occurrence in aquatic systems has been reported by a number of authors. In the context of environmental risk assessment, there is an increasing interest in evaluating the discharge of pharmaceutical products to surface waters through sewage treatment plants (STP). This case study was carried out on a conventional biological treatment plant (Ales, France) and focused on a set of eleven drugs representing the main therapeutic classes. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) range from the low ng L-1 to 1.5 mu g L-1 in effluent and up to few hundred ng L-1 in receiving surface waters. There is a good agreement between MEC and predicted environmental concentration (PEC) values for seven of the eleven investigated drugs in STP effluent. There is not such a good match between PEC and MEC values in surface waters, and this highlights the limits of this approach, at the local scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this paper is to present the current status of membrane bioreactor in industrial wastewater treatment. Membrane bioreactor has been used in treating various type of industrial wastewater due to its advantages over conventional biological treatments. Membrane bioreactors are used in industries like textile, tannery, petrochemical, food processing, pharmaceutical, etc. Membrane bioreactor is used in either in external module or in submerged module. In external module a separate unit after the aeration tank is introduced for solid liquid separation whereas in submerged module the membrane is put inside the aeration tank. The COD removal efficiency of a membrane bioreactor is very high. Moreover, the nitrogen removal is more as sludge can be retained for more time which increases the amount of nitrogen removing organisms. The membrane bioreactor is still not widely adopted because of membrane fouling and high energy demand. Modification of the process can mitigate these problems.

AB In this work the optimal operating conditions for removing selected micropollutants (also known as emerging contaminants, ECs) from actual municipal wastewater by graphene adsorption (GA) and simultaneous electrocoagulation/electrofiltration (EC/EF) process, respectively, were first determined and evaluated. Then, performance and mechanisms for the removal of selected phthalates and pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater simultaneously by the GA and EC/EF process were further assessed. ECs of concern included di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), acetaminophen (ACE), caffeine (CAF), cefalexin (CLX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). It was found that GA plus EC/EF process yielded the following removal efficiencies: DnBP, 89 +/- 2%; DEHP, 85 +/- 3%; ACE, 99 +/- 2%; CAF, 94 +/- 3%; CLX, 100 +/- 0%; and SMX, 98 +/- 2%. Carbon adsorption, size exclusion, electrostatic repulsion, electrocoagulation, and electrofiltration were considered as the main mechanisms for the removal of target ECs by the integrated process indicated above.

AB Microbially catalyzed cleavage of the imadazole ring of caffeine was observed in stream sediments collected upstream and downstream of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in three geographically separate stream systems. Microbial demethylation of the N-methyl component of cotinine and its metabolic precursor, nicotine, also was observed in these sediments. These findings indicate that stream sediment microorganisms are able to substantially alter the chemical structure and thus the analytical signatures of these candidate waste indicator compounds. The potential for in situ biotransformation must be considered if these compounds are employed as markers to identify the sources and track the fate of wastewater compounds in surface-water systems.

Both compounds were detected in all samples analyzed. The concentrations in raw influents at the STPs ranged from 140 to 460 ng L-1 OC and from 184 to 538 ng L-1 AMT. Primary treatment gave no substantial removal of the drugs (OC, 2-9%; AMT, 7-17%). Biological nutrient-removal-based secondary treatment (anoxic-oxic-anoxic-oxic and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic) removed 20-37% of OC, whereas extended-aeration-based conventional activated sludge treatment removed <20%. STPs using primary plus biological secondary treatment removed <50% of the drugs. The incorporation of tertiary treatment by ozonation removed >90%. Ozonation after secondary treatment in STPs will be necessary during an influenza pandemic to reduce the risks associated with the widespread use of antiviral drugs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and pollution characteristics of common antibiotics in manure, soil, and sewage sludge in Shenyang, the biggest city in northeastern China, were investigated. Commonly used antibiotics tetracyclines (TCs), including tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and deoxytetracycline; and sulfonamides (SAs), including sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimidine, and sulfamethoxazole, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry via solid-phase extraction. Multiple antibiotics could be simultaneously measured in a single manure sample. The highest concentration of antibiotics in manure was 143.97 mg kg(-1) (chlortetracycline). There were no significant differences in concentrations of antibiotics between large-scale farms and individual household farms. The concentrations of TCs were significantly higher than those of SAs in manure and soils. However, the concentrations and detection frequencies of antibiotics in soils were significantly lower than in manure. The concentrations of antibiotics varied from 2.56 mu g kg(-1) of sulfadimidine to 1590.16 mu g kg(-1) of chlortetracycline, and the detection frequencies were 27.14-64.29 % for TCs and 5.71-28.57 % for SAs in soils. The concentrations of antibiotics in the vegetable field fertilized with manure were higher than those in the corn field not fertilized with manure. Various kinds of antibiotics were detected in sewage sludge, although concentrations were not high. Concentrations of antibiotics were higher in winter than in summer, The concentrations of antibiotics observed in this study were similar to those observed in other regions of China, but, in general, higher than those in other countries.

AB Antibiotics in manure, soil, wastewater, and groundwater samples from the livestock and poultry farms in Xuzhou City were investigated in the present study. The concentrations of antibiotics in all matrices varied greatly among farms. Total concentrations of fluoroquinolones and macrolides were much higher than those of sulfonamides in manures and soil samples. Total concentrations of antibiotics in wastewater of livestock farms were higher than those of poultry farm. Josamycin (JM) and tilmicosin (TIL) accounted for more than 74% of the nine macrolides in all groundwater samples. Sulfamethizole (SMT), fleroxacin (FLE), cinoxacin (CIN) and JM were the main antibiotics detected in manure and soil samples, while sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), sulfameter (SME), SMT, FLE, JM and TIL accounted for a large proportion of antibiotics in surface and groundwater. The risk assessment of target antibiotics revealed that JM in wastewater showed relatively high RQs for aquatic organisms.

AB The study investigated the pretreatment of real paracetamol (PCT) wastewater of a pharmaceutical industry by Fenton process. At the best experimental conditions (COD/H2O2 = 1/1, Fe+2/H2O2 = 1/70, settling method:centrifuging, pH 6 at settling step), 92.7, 92.7, 95.5, 99.1, 99.9 and 99.4% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), PCT, para-amino phenol (PAP) and aniline were removed, respectively. Changes in the concentrations of these parameters were also investigated for both oxidation and settling steps of Fenton process. It was found that COD and TOC were removed at the settling step (precipitation) whereas PCT, PAP and aniline were removed at the oxidation step. Mass balance calculations were also studied to show the mass distributions of COD in different phases (gas + foam, effluent and sludge). Fenton process was found as an effective method for the pretreatment of real PCT wastewater for discharging in a determined collective treatment plant.

AB Biodiesel wastewaters contain high amounts of oil, methanol, soap and glycerin. These wastewaters pollutant concentrations as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), glycerin and Me0H are fluctuating in the ranges of 250,000-450,000 mg/L, 54,000-110,000 mg/L, 800-1,500 mg/L, and 6,000-15,000 mg/L, respectively. Biodiesel wastewaters lead to blockage of oil drainage systems and reduction of biological activity in biological treatment systems. The purpose of this study was to treat wastewater by ozonation after the electrocoagulation process as pre-treatment. In the ozonation process, the initial wastewater pH value was 13.9, ozone dose was 1.5g/L h, reaction time was 7 h and reaction temperature was 45 C. As a result of 7 h of ozonation, 98.64% of COD, 97.48% of TOC and 99.37% of Me0H removal efficiencies achieved. With these results, biodiesel waste water can be discharge to into the receiving environment according to standards.

AB Conventional sewage treatment systems are generally not designed to remove micropollutants, requiring the development of new technologies, such as the combination of biological processes with advanced oxidative processes. The configuration of an anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor stands out for its use of granular biomass and high sludge bed expansion. Ozonation is an advanced oxidative process that stands out as one of the most promising technologies for the degradation of micropollutants. Thus, the present work aimed to evaluate the removal of drugs through the application of ozonation as a polishing process for the effluent of an EGSB reactor that was fed with synthetic sewage. Ozonation was shown to be efficient in the degradation of these compounds, reaching removals above 90%. It was found that the degradation profile of each drug varied according to its chemical structure since some drugs are more susceptible to oxidation than others and since the concentrations of pharmaceuticals are also related to their removal. Moreover, the assessment of risks to the environment and human health confirmed the need to assess the best scenario for risk reduction considering all drugs, since even with almost complete removal of some compounds, the effluents still showed toxicity. Thus, the high removal efficiencies found for the evaluated micropollutants showed that this technique has the potential to be used to improve the quality of biological reactor effluents or even to be combined in effluent reuse systems.

AB The two representative polycyclic musks, 1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,6,8,8-hexamethyl-2-naphthenyl)-ethanone (AHTN) and 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyrane (HHCB), were measured in aqueous samples and sludge samples of three sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Beijing, China using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. The HHCB and AHTN concentration ranges in the influents were 1251.4-3003.8 ng/L and 111.9-286.3 ng/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the ranges of 492.8-1285.3 ng/L for HHCB and 47.3-89.3 ng/L for AHTN were present in the effluents. The musks in the sludges were three to four orders of magnitude higher than those in aqueous sewages. The removal efficiencies of the two musks varied in the ranges of 41.7%-70.1% for HHCB, and 25.50%-68.8% for AHTN. Adsorption onto suspended particulate matter played an important role in removing musks from the sewages. The HHCB/AHTN ratio along the treatment processes showed that the two musks had high similarity of removal from sewage by each reactor in STP. The musks in the effluent sewages may pose a low potential risk to aquatic environment in terms of the predicted-non-effect concentration. Nevertheless, considering the possible additive and synergistic effects with other compounds emitted via STPs, their bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms and so on, it is essential to monitor these compounds in various compartments and to study their environmental fate.

AB Antibiotic resistance (AR) is becoming a worldwide threat due to the increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial strains. There is a general consensus about the potential implications of the use of antibiotics in livestock on the onset of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), mainly through meat consumption. However, the ever-increasing use of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) in agriculture may also contribute significantly to the non-accounted exposure to antibiotics, ARB, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This position paper aims at evaluating the current knowledge concerning the occurrence of antibiotics, ARBs, and ARGs in edible parts of different common crops irrigated with RWW. We will discuss which regulations on the use of RWW may contribute to the minimization of the prevalence of these contaminants in crops, and provide recommendations on how to minimize the impact of these practices.

AB Influence of inherent buffering nature of real field pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) was evaluated in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) at varying organic loads (OL1-OL4). Dynamics of in situ buffers present in the wastewater during remediation enhanced the electrogenic activity. Improvement in power density (PD) and open circuit voltage (OCV) was observed as the organic load increased from OL1 to OL4 (PD of 62.45 to137 mW/m(2); OCV-245 to 324 mV). It was concluded from the buffering capacity () profiles that base values were relatively more stable than acid values indicating the dynamics of nutrients and salts present in PW. pH increased with increase in OL documenting improvement in power output and waste remediation. Present study depicted an optimum pH range suitable for effective operation of MFC for bioelectrogenesis using PW as substrate.

AB A QExactive Orbitrap was used for the identification of phase I and II transformation products (TPs) of illicit drugs in raw sewage influents. Two operating modes (targeted MS2 and Data-dependent screening) were used for data acquisition. Even though, data-dependent scan is a faster route towards the potential identification of metabolites, it suffered from its limitation to provide enough data points across the chromatographic peak during the MS2 cycle in contrast to targeted MS2. Therefore, the later technique was implemented as the method of choice in this study for the positive confirmation and quantitation of TPs (n =54). The vast majority of the identified TPs were products of phase I transformation reactions, with the latter being more prevalent in the nature. Estimated mole fractions showed that for a large number of the analytes, TPs must also be monitored in order to fully understand their environmental fate and calculate potential consumption.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated that aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) remove pharmaceuticals better than activated sludge. Thus we used a MBBR system to polish the effluent of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. To overcome that effluent contains insufficient organic matter to sustain enough biomass, the biofilm was intermittently fed with raw wastewater.
   The capacity of pharmaceutical degradation was investigated by spiking pharmaceuticals. Actual removal during treatment was assessed by sampling the inlets and outlets of reactors. The removal of the majority of pharmaceuticals was enhanced through the intermittent feeding of the MBBR. First-order rate constants for pharmaceutical removal, normalised to biomass, were significantly higher compared to other studies on activated sludge and suspended biofilms, especially for diclofenac, metoprolol and atenolol. Due to the intermittently feeding, degradation of diclofenac occurred with a half-life of only 2.1 h and was thus much faster than any hitherto described wastewater bioreactor treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) discharged with wastewater treatment effluents are a surface water quality concern. PPCPs are partially removed during wastewater treatment and biological transformation is an important removal mechanism. To investigate the potential for enhanced PPCP removal using bioaugmentation, bacteria were previously isolated from activated sludge capable of degrading PPCPs to ng/L concentrations. This study examined the degradation kinetics of triclosan and bisphenol A by five of these bacteria, both in pure culture and when augmented to activated sludge. Sorption coefficients were determined to account for the influence of partitioning during bioremoval. When the bacteria were added to activated sludge, degradation increased. Experimentally determined kinetic parameters were used to model a full-scale continuous treatment process, showing that low biomass could achieve reduced effluent PPCP concentrations. These results demonstrated that bioaugmentation may improve PPCP removal using established wastewater infrastructure under conditions of high solids partitioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One of the most frequently detected organic chemicals in a nationwide study concerning the effects of wastewater on stream water quality conducted in the year 2000 was the widely used insect repellant NN-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). It was detected at levels of 0.02 mu g/L or greater in 73% of the stream sites sampled, with the selection of sampling sites being biased toward streams thought to be subject to wastewater contamination (i.e., downstream from intense urbanization and livestock production). Although DEET frequently was detected at all sites, the median concentration was low (0.05 mu g/L). The highest concentrations of DEET were found in streams from the urban areas (maximum concentration, 1.1 mu g/L). The results of the present study suggest that the movement of DEET to streams through wastewater- treatment systems is an important mechanism that might lead to the exposure of aquatic organisms to this chemical.

AB An analytical method was developed for the simultaneous extraction and determination of 18 fluoroquinolones (FQs), tetracyclines (TCs) and sulfonamides (SAs) antibiotics from soils using solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The soils were extracted by different solvents with the help of mechanical shaking and ultrasonic treatment at 59 kHz, followed by a strong anion exchange (SAX) cartridge to clean up soil samples and a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge as enrichment. The method was evaluated by testing the following variables: extraction solvents, the type of SPE cartridges, solvent volumes, initial spiking levels and soil types (silty clay loam and clay loam soils). The soil extraction method was validated using these two types of soils, representing two typical agricultural soils in northern China. For 2 g soil, the extraction steps with the mixture of potassium phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (ACN) (1/1, v/v, pH 3.2) provided satisfactory recoveries. In the clay loam soil, the recoveries of all the compounds were from 56% to 89% at the spiking level of 50 mu g kg(-1) soil, and from 69% to 97% at the spiking level of 200 mu g kg(-1) soil, respectively. Recoveries in silty clay loam soil were similar to that in clay loam. The method was successfully employed using soil samples collected from a farmland and afforestion area irrigated with sewage in northern China. The result indicates that trace antibiotics in sewage may accumulate in soil irrigated by river water containing sewage.

AB In this study we developed a systematic method for suspect screening and target quantification of the human pharmaceutical residues in water, via solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We then proceeded to study the occurrences and distribution of the pharmaceuticals in the surface waters of Wuhan, China, by analyzing water samples from lakes, rivers and municipal sewage. Initially, 33 human pharmaceuticals were identified from East Lake without using purchasing standards. Of these, 29 were later confirmed by using standards, and quantified using the aforementioned SPE pretreatment method and LC-HRMS analysis in full MS scan mode. The 29 compounds included 8 antibiotics, 9 metabolites, and 12 miscellaneous pharmaceuticals. The highest proportions of pharmaceutical residues were detected downstream of the Yangtze River and in the lakes close to the central city. Metformin, cotinine, and trans-3-hydroxy cotinine, were frequently encountered in all the surface water samples. High concentrations (>120 ng/l) of caffeine, metformin, theobromine, and valsartan were detected in the surface water samples; the removal rates of these compounds in the municipal sewage treatment plant were also high. In contrast, although the concentrations of 4-AAA and metoprolol acid in the surface water were high, the removal rates of these residues in the sewage treatment plant were low.

AB The fate and removal of 48 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge were investigated in four full-scale sewage treatment plants (STPs). We measured concentrations in both the liquid and solid phases of the sludge to compare the distribution ratios (K-d) between phases before and after digestion. The results showed changes in K-d values of PPCPs with carboxyl or amino functional groups, probably due to a shift of dissociation equilibrium with the increase in pH. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were almost completely degraded (>90%); triclosan, triclocarban, and ofloxacin were moderately degraded (around 30-50%); but carbamazepine was not eliminated. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows (i) the occurrence and removal of several tens of PPCPs by anaerobic sludge digestion in full-scale municipal STPs and (ii) the change of distribution between the liquid and solid phases during digestion.

Effects of operational parameters on imazapyr removal efficiency including TiO2 dosing, initial herbicide concentration and pH were also studied. Obtained results showed that more than 90% of removal efficiency representing the disappearance of imazapyr was maintained until 7 mu M in the presence of 200 mgL(-1) of UV100-TiO2.

AB The potential of Phragmites australis was evaluated for the removal of three veterinary drugs, enrofloxacin (ENR), ceftiofur (CEF) and tetracycline (TET), from aquatic mediums.
   Results showed that the plant promoted the removal of 94% and 75% of ENR and TET, respectively, from wastewater. Microbial abundance estimation revealed that microorganisms were not a major participant. Occurrence of drugs adsorption to plant roots was observed in small extension. Therefore, main mechanisms occurring were drug removal by plant uptake and/or degradation. Present results demonstrated the potential of P. australis-planted beds to be used for removal of pharmaceuticals from livestock and slaughterhouse industries wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals removal from urban wastewater by coupling conventional sand filtration with graphene adsorption reactor (GAR) was investigated. During GAR regime phase, the percentage removal of the four investigated pharmaceuticals, (namely caffeine, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and diclofenac) was higher than 95% (98.2, 97.0, 95.5 and 97.0%, respectively). In spite of the high initial concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals (10 mg/L each) and 4 months of experimentation (62 days of adsorption treatment), typical breakthrough adsorption curves were not observed. Graphene adsorption treatment effectively decreased toxicity to Daphnia magna (0-50% immobilization), but only a slight improvement in germination index (phyto-toxicity tests) was observed after GAR treatment. Finally, graphene performances were compared with conventional (granular activated carbon) adsorption process, and the best performance in the removal of pharmaceutical mixture was quite poor (62% in terms of UV absorbance) compared to GAR (96%).

AB Tannin rigid foams were synthesized at lab scale in order to confirm their feasibility in wastewater treatment. Different water samples containing three emerging contaminants (Methylene blue, Polyoxyethylene (3.5) sodium lauryl ether sulfate and Trimethoprim) were subjected to adsorption process with these novel products. The experimental results confirmed the ability of these foams for removing anionic and cationic contaminants through adsorption process. Kinetic data were adjusted to Lagergren, Ho and Elovich model. Both the second and the third one presented an average r(2) above 0.96. Equilibrium studies on the three studied systems revealed Langmuir and Freundlich models were also adequate for predicting the behavior of the adsorption process. High adsorption capacities were reached (ca. 215, 65 and 25 mg g(-1) for dye, surfactant and pharmaceutical respectively), which were comparable to other commercial adsorbents already available and functional in wastewater treatments. Therefore, this new ability must be added to the list of advantages these new materials seem to present. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biomethylation of metals and metalloids of Group 14 and 15 metals such as tin, lead and arsenic takes place in the environment, but information about methylated bismuth compounds is rather limited, although bismuth compounds are used widely in alloys, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products,
   Cryotrapping gas chromatography and hydride generation gas chromatography coupled with an ICP-MS as a bismuth-selective detector were used to determine volatile bismuth compounds in landfill and in sewage gas, as well as non-volatile methylated compounds in water and sediment samples,
   One volatile bismuth compound could be determined in gaseous samples; it was identified as Me3Bi (TMB) by element-specific detection (ICP-MS, m/z 209), matching the retention time with a TMB standard. The molecular structure was recently confirmed by gas-chromatographic fractionation with MS-ion trap detection (electron impact), Among other volatile metal compounds, TMB is a major component in the gases of sewage sludge digesters: concentrations of up to 25 mu g m(-3) have been measured at eight sewage treatment plants, The concentration in landfill gas was approximately one order of magnitude lower.
   In laboratory experiments, fermenters containing an anaerobic culture from a clean pond sludge were mixed with contaminated soil from four different industrial areas, After an incubation time of two weeks at 30 degrees C in the dark, TMB was detected in the headspace of all the samples, The volatilization rate of bismuth did mot correlate with the total amount of bismuth: in the sediments or with the available fraction after acid digestion following hydride generation. Some evidence was obtained for the occurrence of methylated bismuth compounds in water samples and in sediments, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to treat complex wastewater consisting of domestic wastewater, tobacco processing and building materials washings. The proposed multi-level bioreactor consists of a biopond-biofilter, anoxic/aerobic (A/O) fluidized beds and a photoautotrophic system. The results show that when the hydraulic load of the bioreactor was 200m(3)/d, it successfully and simultaneously removed the organic matter and metals. When the bioreactor was in a relatively steady-state condition, the overall average organic matter and metals removal efficiencies are as follows, COD (89%), UV245 nm-matter (91%), Cu (78%), Zn (79%) and Fe (84%). The growth conditions of the native bacterial habitat were improved, which resulted from the increase of the in bacterial diversity under the rejuvenated conditions induced by the bioreactor. The results demonstrate that the multi-level bioreactor, without a sludge treatment system, can remove heterogeneous organic matter and metals from wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology is an increasingly popular method for analysing drugs or metabolites excreted by populations. The in-sewer transformation of biomarkers is important but often receives little consideration in published studies. Many studies publish stability under biofilm-free conditions only, which do not represent actual sewer conditions. This study aims to fill a gap in the field by comparing the wastewater stability of 33 licit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers in biofilm-free (BFF) conditions to stability in sewer biofilm reactors. All but one biomarker was stable under BFF conditions, whereas most transformed in sewer biofilm reactors. Sewer reactor results tended to overestimate the degradation in pilot and actual sewers, whereas BFF stability had no clear relationship to stability in pilot and actual sewers. Our results provide additional basis for more informed interpretation of biofilm-free and sewer reactor stability results for past and future WBE studies. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Although, several recent greenhouse studies are beginning to address the uptake of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by a variety of crops, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on uptake. Hence, in this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in order to study the interactions occurring exclusively between PPCPs in soil, and in the edible plant part of beets (Beta vulgaris) after exposure to treated wastewater effluent. According to the findings, the interactions between the pharmaceuticals caffeine (CFN) with bisoprolol (BSP), carbamezapine (CMZ), clarithromycin (CMC), metoprolol (MPL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TMP) occurring in soil were almost 99% synergistic; it was noted variability in the interactive capacity of the pharmaceuticals; the concentrations of pharmaceuticals which measured did not affect unfavorably beet yield; interactions between the PPCPs via the PPCPs contribution in plant and soil affect the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the beets.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are recognized as one of the most serious emerging micropollutants. Wastewater treatment plants are the major way through which such contaminants enter the environment. Therefore, an appropriate management of PhACs in these facilities can reduce their release into the environment. In particular, a proper sampling methodology is necessary to identify and quantify micropollutants in wastewater. In this study, 37 pharmaceuticals (including 23 antibiotics) are investigated in eight major wastewater treatment plants in Beijing. An optimized sampling methodology is successfully implemented to monitor bihourly variation of the contaminants, thus averting uncertainties derived from conventional sampling methods. In this way, more accurate pharmaceutical load patterns are determined and discussed. Thanks to the synchronous data on pharmaceutical concentration and wastewater flow, we also compare performances of various treatment processes and optimize different calculation methods for removal efficiency.

AB Biodegradation of organic wastewater constituents by activated sludge microorganisms is based on enzymatic processes. It is supposed that wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) differ in their enzymatic fingerprints. To determine such fingerprints, activated sludges from nine aerated tanks of six WWTPs were repeatedly sampled and analyzed for the activities of L-alanine aminopeptidase, esterase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, phosphotriesterase, and sulfatase. In one WWTP the enzymatic activities and their variations within 1 week were assayed in various process stages.
   Mostly the enzymatic profiles were dominated by L-alanine aminopeptidase, followed by alkaline phosphatase. They differed in variable contributions of esterase, phosphodiesterase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase. The sulfatase activity was generally low. For the first time phosphotriesterase activity was detected in various samples, but with limited analytical validity. Particle mass-related activities of individual enzymes varied between plants by factors 2-4 and up to 11, when related to suspension volumes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the last decade, several screening programs for pharmaceuticals at Swedish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been conducted by research institutes, county councils, and wastewater treatment companies. In this study, influent and effluent concentrations compiled from these screening programs were used to assess the occurrence and reduction of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals for human usage. The study is limited to full-scale WWTPs with biological treatment. Based on the data compiled, a total of 70 non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals have been detected, at concentrations ranging from a few ng/L to several mu g/L, in the influent water. The influent concentrations were compared with the sale volumes and for many pharmaceuticals it was shown that only a small fraction of the amount sold reaches WWTPs as dissolved parent compounds. Pharmaceuticals with low reduction degrees at traditional WWTPs were identified. Further comparison based on the biological treatment showed lower reduction degrees for several pharmaceuticals in trickling filter plants compared with activated sludge plants with nitrogen removal.

AB This research was set up in response to new European legislation to identify cost-effective treatment for removal of steroid estrogens from effluent. This study aimed to compare estrogen removal of two types of granular activated carbon: virgin (F400) and reactivated (C401) carbon. Rapid, small-scale column tests were conducted with a total bed volume of 24.9 cm(3) over three columns, and analysis was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results demonstrated that C401 performed more efficiently with greater than or equal to 81% estrogen removal in wastewater compared to F400 which produced greater than or equal to 65% estrogen removal. Estrogen removal can be affected by competitive adsorption from natural organic matter present in wastewater. In addition, the physical properties of each carbon had the potential to influence adsorption differently, thus resulting in the observed varied adsorption capability of the two carbons.

AB Microalgae based treatment was studied to polish sequential batch reactor (SBR) treated pharmaceutical wastewater under mixotrophic mode of operation with simultaneous biomass/lipid production. At the end of biomass growth phase (BGP), carbon removal efficiency was observed to be 73% along with good removal of nitrates (62%). Since microalgae assimilate nutrients from wastewater for growth, an increment in total biomass productivity (2.8 g/l) was observed. Subjecting to nutrient stress phase (NSP), total lipid content of 17.2% with neutral lipids of 6.2% was observed under light condition. Contrarily, dark condition depicted total lipid content of 15.8% with neutral lipids constituting 6.5%. The nutrient stress in combination with light showed marked influence on the profile of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Integration of microalgae cultivation improves environmental sustainability and enables greener routes of biofuels and value added products synthesis in a biorefinery approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to produce biodegradable products, four different synthetically prepared wastewaters containing cephalosporine (ceftriaxone sodium), penicillin (penicillin VK and amoxicillin) and quinolone (enrofloxacin) group antibiotics at typical concentrations encountered in pharmaceutical formulation effluent were pretreated by ozonation. BOD5/COD and SOUR (specific oxygen uptake rate) were the parameters for the assessment of biodegradability of ozonation products. The results of HPLC analysis indicated that the complete removal of each antibiotically active substance was achieved within the short time period of ozonation. Depending upon the type of antibiotic in the synthetic wastewater. 65-81 % COD and 20-98% aromaticity (UV254) removals were obtained, with a 2960 mg/L.h ozone dosage applied at pH 7 (CODi = 900 mg/L). Ozonation brought about a rise in the BOD5/COD ratio of enrofloxacin-containing wastewater from an initial value of 0.02 to a maximum of 0.33. and this ratio was increased from 0 to 0.07, 0.28 and 0.42, for ceftriaxone sodium, penicillin VK and amoxicillin-containing wastewaters, respectively.

AB Many technologies are being developed for the efficient removal of micropollutants from wastewater and, among them, fungal degradation is one of the possible alternative biological treatments. In this article, some factors that might affect pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) removal in a fungal treatment of real wastewater were identified in batch bioreactor treating reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). We found that degradation of PhACs by Trametes versicolor was enhanced by addition of external nutrients (global removal of 44%). Moreover, our results point out that high aeration might be involved in the increase in the concentration of some PhACs. In fact, conjugation and deconjugation processes (among others) affect the removal assessment of emerging contaminants when working with real concentrations in comparison to experiments with spiked samples. Moreover, factors that could affect the quantification of micropollutants at lab-scale experiments were studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the treatment effect in the pharmaceutical wastewater in the biochemical system, the experiment domesticated efficient aerobic activated sludge to deal with wastewater deeply. In the presence of glucose co-matrix, indole was used as the characteristic pollutant to acclimate aerobic activated sludge by increasing pollutant concentration. The degradation characteristics and microbial characteristics during training were studied. The experimental results showed that indole could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in activated sludge, but after 2 months of intensive culture, activated sludge could adapt to the environment in which indole was the only carbon source. The bacteria species in the sludge were mainly Comamonas (34.18%) and Acinetobacter (15.45%), which could treat indole with a concentration of 200mg/L, the degradation efficiency was increased from 80% to more than 98.6%, and the SOUR value was stable at more than 7.61 mgO(2)/g MLSS.h, which was suitable for application in advanced treatment engineering of indole-containing pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed antidepressant (Prozac), has been detected in sewage effluent. Its active metabolite norfluoxetine is more potent and has been detected in sewage influent and in fish tissues. We tested the effects of norfluoxetine on spawning and parturition in bivalves. Norfluoxetine induced significant spawning in zebra mussels and dark false mussels at concentrations as low as 5 mu M. Norfluoxetine induced significant parturition in fingernail clams at 10 mu M. Fluoxetine also induced spawning in dark false mussels at concentrations as low as 100 nM. Implications for environmental impacts of norfluoxetine and fluoxetine on native and exotic bivalves are discussed.

AB Samples of influent (untreated) and effluent (treated) from 18 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 14 municipalities in Canada were analyzed for residues of selected prescription and nonprescription drugs. Several neutral and acidic drugs were detected in effluents. including analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents, lipid regulators, and an antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine. Residues were extracted from effluents by solid-phase extraction, followed by either methylation and analysis of acidic drugs by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or direct analysis of neutral drugs by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as the metabolite of acetylsalicyclic acid, salicylic acid, were often detected in final effluents at mug/L concentrations. The acidic lipid regulator, clofibric acid, and the analgesic/anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac were not detected in any final effluent samples, which is not consistent with data from Europe. The precursor to clofibric acid, clofibrate, is not widely prescribed as a lipid regulator in Canada. However, the lipid regulators bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were detected in some samples Of influent and effluent. The chemotherapy drugs ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide and the anti-inflammatory phenazone were not detected in influent or effluent samples, but the vasodilator drug pentoxyfylline was detected at ng/L concentrations in some final effluents. The widespread occurrence of carbamazepine at concentrations as high as 2.3 mug/L may be explained by use of this drug for other therapeutic purposes besides treatment of epilepsy and its resistance to elimination in STPs. The rates of elimination of ibuprofen and naproxen appeared to be elevated in STPs with hydraulic retention times for sewage greater than 12 h.

AB The removal of four pharmaceutically active compounds, i.e., anti-inflammatory painkiller diclofenac (DCF), lipid-regulating agent clofibric acid (CFA), epilepsy drugs carbamazepine (CBM), and broad-spectrum anti-bacterial agent triclosan (TCS), present in sewage sludge was investigated using anaerobic digestion processes in the mesophilic and thermophilic modes. Sludge retention times (SRTs) were set at 10, 15, and 20 days, respectively, for the mesophilic mode and 7, 15, and 20 days, respectively, for the thermophilic mode. The effective isolation and purification pre-treatment to extract the target compounds from the sewage sludge samples were firstly established, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis to identify and quantify them. The removal efficiencies of the target compounds could be raised to a certain extent with the increase on SRTs, especially under the mesophilic condition. The removal of CFA and TCS under thermophilic condition hardly varied when the SRTs were above 15 days. All the compounds could be partly removed from the sewage sludge under the two temperature conditions, particularly TCS that was reduced by about 74 %. Besides, CFA, firstly reported in this study, could be reduced by maximal 65 %. On the whole, the thermophilic mode was more conducive to the removal of CBM and TCS, but did not have a noticeable effect on the removal of CFA. Furthermore, DCF could be better removed in the mesophilic mode. In addition, NH3-N accumulation in this measured range might positively affect the removal of the selected compounds, particularly in the mesophilic mode.

AB The excessive release of phosphorus is a main cause of eutrophication, but phosphorus itself is an important non-renewable resource. If phosphorus could be recovered from wastewater, it can not only reduce the pollution, but also reach the aim of resource recycle. An induced crystallization process was combined with the schorl/H2O2 system to remove and recover phosphorus from the fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater. Firstly, in the schorl/H2O2 heterogeneous Fenton system, the organic phosphorus (OP) in fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater was transformed to the inorganic phosphorus (IP), and then IP was recovered by hydroxyapatite (HAP) induced crystallization process. In sequence batch reactors (SBR), the entire crystallization process went through 60 cycles, and each of the cycle lasted for 12 h, including 2 h for reaction and 10 h for sedimentation. The influence of different initial pH values, which were 8, 9, 10 and 11, on the induced crystallized product was investigated. The morphology and structure of the induced crystallized product were analysed. The results indicated that when the pH value was about 8, most of the recovery products was in the form of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCP, CaHPO4). At pH 9 the recovery products were mainly DCP and HAP. As pH increased to 10 or 11, most of the recovery products would be HAP and calcium carbonate. Carbonate involved in the crystallization reaction, especially at pH 11.

AB A laboratory scale aerobic oxidation ditch combined with an anoxic reactor was conducted to treat wastewater from a chemical industrial park in Tianjin, China. The wastewater exhibited a low biodegradability, and the results of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that some recalcitrant organic components are present in the wastewater. Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal efficiency of over 90% was obtained. However, the removal efficiencies of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were below 16% and 15%, respectively. The addition of glucose to the anoxic reactor in the system increased the removal efficiencies of TN and COD to approximately 72% and 25.57%, respectively. Results of mass balance indicate that about 60% of the external carbon was consumed as electron donor for denitrification, while 40% was consumed as a substrate for co-metabolism. The optimal dose of added glucose was also investigated, which was determined at 0.35 to 1.20 (CODglucose:CODoriginal).

AB Ozonation has become more frequently used as oxidant to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) and toxic substances in wastewater originating from different industrial processes. An ozonation pilot plant followed by two parallel biological filters are used to investigate the possibility to reduce the high concentration of refractory COD in the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, partly loaded with biologically treated wastewater from a large pharmaceutical industry. COD measurements are used to evaluate the overall reduction of organic matter, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and volatile fatty acids measurements are used for evaluation of the biodegradability of the remaining COD after ozonation. The impact of the ozone dose on the overall COD degradation and degradability of the remaining COD has been estimated. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) measurements confirm that parts of the COD are converted into biodegradable organic matter by ozonation. Biofilters following the ozonation plant secure that any degradable organic matter produced by ozonation is removed, which is confirmed from OUR-measurements.

AB Advanced oxidation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in wastewater produces transformation products (TPs) that are often more biodegradable than the parent compounds. Secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was treated using UV-based advanced oxidation (LPUV/H2O2 and MPUV/NO3) followed by biological aerated filtration (BAF), and different APIs and their transformation products were monitored. The advanced oxidation processes degraded the APIs by 55-87% (LPUV/H2O2) and 58-95% (MPUV/NO3), while minor loss of APIs was achieved in the downstream BAF system. Eleven TPs were detected following oxidation of carbamazepine (5) and iopromide (6); three key TPs were biodegraded in the BAF system. The other TPs remained relatively constant in the BAF. The decrease in UV absorbance (UVA(254)) of the effluent in the BAF system was linearly correlated to the degradation of the APIs (for the MPUV/NO3-BAF), and can be applied to monitor the biotransformation of APIs in biological-based systems.

AB Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is one of the most representative characteristics of pollutant in pharmaceutical industry usually has high biological toxicity, making it difficult to treat. In this study, a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was employed to treat THF pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). During the 80-day operating time, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and THF removal efficiencies reached 95.3% and 98.5% when HRT was above 24 h. Mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) in the attached sludge on membrane surface showed a trend of rising on first 28 days (48h-36 h) and then decreasing. Protein is the major component of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) independent of changes in HRT. The study concludes that THF pharmaceutical wastewater can be effectively remedied in the AnMBR system at low HRT. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, pharmaceutical wastewater with high salinity and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) was treated by an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and an anaerobic bio-entrapped membrane reactor (AnBEMR). The microbial populations and communities were analyzed using the 454 pyrosequencing method. The hydraulic retention time (HRT), membrane flux and mean cell residence time (MCRT) were controlled at 30.6 h, 6 L/m(2) h and 100 d, respectively. The results showed that the AnBEMR achieved higher TCOD removal efficiency and greater biogas production compared to the AnMBR. Through DNA pyrosequencing analysis, both the anaerobic MBRs showed similar dominant groups of bacteria and archaea. However, phylum Elusimicrobia of bacteria was only detected in the AnBEMR; the higher abundance of dominant archaeal genus Methanimicrococcus found in the AnBEMR could play an important role in degradation of the major organic pollutant (i.e., trimethylamine) present in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The presence of xenobiotic compounds especially organic micro-pollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) is a major concern worldwide. The occurrence and removal of trace organic pollutants in a MWWTP by a combined analysis using GC-MS with spectral analysis and acute toxicity were studied in this work. Non-target screening and toxicity analysis of organic compounds were conducted to understand the types of toxic and refractory pollutants in municipal wastewater and evaluated the toxicity removal efficiency of MWWTP. The results showed that most of the effects were significantly reduced or completely eliminated during the waste-water treatment process, while some compounds, such as antioxidants, drugs, and organic plasticizers, had detection rates of up to 100% at each site, indicating that these harmful substances remained throughout wastewater treatment process. Based on Pearson correlation analysis, paired correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between UV254, humification index, conventional parameters, and organic acute toxicity, while acute toxicity was negatively correlated with biological index and fluorescence index. The results indicated that the composition of MWWTP had a similar influence law in different locations, and the combination of spectral analysis provided a new insight to qualitatively and quantitatively showed the distribution of organic pollutants in the wastewater treatment system.

AB Microalgae can utilize the pollutants from wastewater as substrate and act as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. In this study, the pharmaceutical wastewater was pretreated in photobioreactor (PBR) using microalgae Scenedesmus abundans. The pretreated effluent was further treated in a photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) for production of biomass and electricity. The biomass generated in PBR and PMFC was used for biodiesel production. At the end of pretreatment process, maximum 77 +/- 3% of the COD was removed along with nitrate and phosphate removal of 82 +/- 0.5 and 65.9 +/- 0.4%, respectively. In continuation of the treatment process, in PMFC a maximum of 88 +/- 3% COD was removed resulting in 97.24% total COD removal. Overall (97.12% Nitrate and 93.71% phosphate) were also removed. A maximum voltage of 745.96 mV and power density of 838.68 mW/m(2) were achieved. The amount of biomass produced in PBR and PFMC process was 0.97 +/- 0.01 g/L and 0.94 +/- 0.01 g/L, respectively. Fatty acid profile of Scenedesmus abundans from both the processes has shown the presence of ample amount of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with C16 and C18 carbon chain. This study indicates that the integration of microalgal pretreatment may help in an efficient bioremediation process of pharmaceutical wastewater as well as bioelectricity production.

AB The pressure on natural water resources associated with increasing water scarcity highlights the value of using reclaimed water through the development of efficient and environmentally friendly treatment technologies. In this work, the use of magnetic nanoparticles in photo-Fenton catalysis for water disinfection was considered to inactivate natural enteric bacteria present in municipal wastewater effluents under white light and neutral pH. The most recommended ranges were evaluated in key variables such as the loading and composition of nanoparticles (NPs), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, the light source (UV and visible) and treatment time were evaluated in wastewater disinfection expressed in terms of total coliforms and Escherichia coli colony forming units (CFU). The magnetic separation of NPs allowed the disinfection process to be carried out in different cycles, facilitating the recovery of the nanocatalyst and avoiding its discharge with the treated effluent.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are widely recognized as the main source of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) in natural water courses. The problem is aggravated in those regions where water is scarce and its reuse is necessary. With the aim of avoiding these problems, the present paper reports the results obtained by installing a nanofiltration membrane at the outlet of the secondary decanter at the WWTP situated in the municipality of Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), Permeate samples were taken over a period of 72 h while the membranes were operating. Contaminants belonging to the aforementioned families (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin and penicillin G) were analysed by means of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The results indicate that nanofiltration removed these contaminants from the wastewater turning the treated water as suitable to be reused for all the uses included in the Spanish Royal Decree 1620/2007 on water regeneration and reuse. 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High-quality Al@Fe-MOF was prepared by in situ modification of Fe-MOF with Al3+. In this study, Box Behnken design as a response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effects of major operating variables and optimization conditions of Al@Fe-MOF on COD removal of oily wastewater. Results showed that initial pH was important more than other parameters, and the order of influence of the value is: ozone flux > initial pH > MOF dosage > reaction temperature. When the ozone flux is 1602.06 mg / L, the MOF dosage is added 0.32 g, the initial pH of the wastewater is 7.04, and the reaction temperature is 29.32 C, the maximum COD removal rate of the wastewater is 95.52%. The predicted value of the model is more accurate and the model predicts better performance. Therefore, the combination of the best response value and the optimal factor level is also credible.

AB Treated sewage effluent (TSE) is becoming a critical resource in arid parts of the world. The high costs of desalinated potable water and the depletion of fresh groundwater resources necessitate increased use of TSE as an important component of water resource management throughout the Middle East. TSE can replace potable-quality water in irrigation, with the latter becoming too valuable a resource to use for irrigation purposes. In urban regions of the Middle East and North Africa, excess TSE is often available because of seasonal variations in demand and supply or that the development of reuse infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, concomitant water use and TSE generation. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) technology provides an opportunity to store large volumes of TSE for later beneficial use. Natural attenuation processes that occur during underground storage in an ASR system can also act to improve the quality of stored water and thus provide an opportunity to 'polish' already high-quality TSE. Aquifers containing brackish water or those depleted from over-pumping are present throughout much of the Middle East. These aquifers could potentially be used as storage zones for ASR systems. However, currently available hydrogeologic data are insufficient for assessment of potential system performance. Other key design issues are the selection of ASR system locations and storage zones so that TSE will not enter potable water supplies, and ensuring that the ASR systems will be readily integrated into existing or planned sewage treatment, TSE transmission and reuse infrastructure.

AB Stability and removal of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) from wastewater produced at Al-Quds University Campus were investigated. Kinetic studies in both pure water and wastewater coming from secondary treatment (activated sludge) demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory DSP underwent degradation to its hydrolytic derivative, dexamethasone, in both media. The first-order hydrolysis rate of DSP in activated sludge at 25 degrees C (3.80x10(-6)s(-1)) was about 12-fold larger than in pure water (3.25x10(-7)s(-1)). The overall performance of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed in the University Campus was also assessed showing that 90% of spiked DSP was removed together with its newly identified metabolites by the ultra-filtration (UF) system, which consists of a UF hollow fibre (HF) with a 100-kDa cutoff membrane as the pre-polishing stage for the UF spiral wound with a 20-kDa cutoff membrane. In testing other technologies, the effectiveness of adsorption and filtration by micelle-clay (MC) preparation for removing DSP was ascertained in comparison with activated charcoal. Batch adsorption in aqueous suspensions of the MC composite and activated carbon was well described by Langmuir isotherms showing the best results for MC material. Filtration of DSP water solutions demonstrated a significant advantage of columns filled in with a mixture of sand and MC complex in comparison with activated carbon/sand filters.

AB A novel poly-Al-Fe coagulant containing zinc (PAZF) was prepared from a solid waste of galvanized-aluminum slag and its hydrolysis performance was studied. The coagulation behavior by PAZF was investigated in treating different wastewater samples compared to that by poly-aluminum-chloride (PAC). The results showed that PAZF hydrolysis could be seen as a hydrolysis process of complex salt and appeared to be characteristics of different types of salt at various concentrations. PAZF showed the nature of "strong acid and weak base salt" or "strong base and weak acid salt" at lower or higher PAZF level, respectively. For different types of wastewaters, PAZF yielded better removal of color and organic matters than PAC. For dyeing, papermaking, sugar, pharmaceutical and simulated wastewater samples, the removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (CODCr ) by PAZF were up to 60.3%, 97.3%, 60%, 78.3% and 98.5%, and 32.5%, 48.1%, 41.6%, 45.4% and 82%, respectively. PAZF gave more 23%, 5%, 5%, 19% and 4%, and 8.1%, 6%, -1%, 7.2% and 18.4% than PAC in removing color and CODCr , respectively. The best pH for removing color by PAZF was different for different wastewater samples. PAZF could withstand great impact load of wastewater qualities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the biotreatment of an industrial wastewater taken from a chemical plant synthesising drugs for the pharmaceutical sector was studied. Industrial and domestic wastewaters were combined at laboratory scale and the effect of PAC addition was tested in aerobic reactors. The aim of this addition was to decrease inhibitory and nonbiodegradable organics. Two different procedures were applied in testing the effectiveness of PAC. First, PAC was directly added to activated sludge mixed liquor. In the second case, industrial wastewater was first contacted with PAC and then treated biologically. In the evaluation of performance, COD measurements, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurements and measurements in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were taken into consideration. Both direct PAC addition and PAC pretreatment led finally to similar results. In both cases, the concentration of non-biodegradable matter could be lowered. In particular, the colour of the wastewater was significantly reduced. Direct PAC addition appeared to be more practical and plausible. In any case, PAC addition to activated sludge increased the OUR of the sludge, indicating that inhibition could be decreased. The study also pointed out that in the assessment of PAC performance, the combined evaluation of OUR, spectral parameters and COD would be much more informative than the COD parameter alone.

AB This research investigates the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on micropollutant biodegradation of two-stage activated sludge (AS) system augmented with acclimatized sludge treating low-micropollutants wastewater. The experimental wastewater was a mixture of landfill leachate and agriculture wastewater, and HRT was varied between 24, 18, and 12 h. The results showed that, under 24 h HRT, the micropollutant biodegradation efficiencies were 87-93% for bisphenol A (BPA), 2,6-di-tertbutyl-phenol (2,6-DTBP), di-butyl-phthalate (DBP), di-(ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP); 75-81% for carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF); and 88% for N,N-diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET). The degradation efficiencies were similar under 18 h HRT: 87-93% for BPA, 2,6-DTBP, DBP, DEHP; 75-80% for CBZ, DCF; and 80% for DEET. However, the efficiencies substantially declined under 12 h HRT: 71-93%, 55-60%, and 50%, respectively. Importantly, the findings revealed that HRT plays a crucial part in micropollutant biodegradation of bioaugmented AS system. More specifically, too short an HRT (12 h) results in low micropollutant removal efficiency, and too long an HRT (24 h) contributes to low daily throughput and high treatment operation cost. As a result, moderate HRT (18 h) is operationally and economically optimal for bioaugmented AS system treating low-micropollutants wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports an experimental degradation study of nineteen multi-class pharmaceutical products present in the influent wastewater arriving at the Daugavgriva wastewater treatment plant. Collected wastewater samples were filtered and irradiated by electron beam and gamma radiation both generated from a 5 MeV linear particle accelerator. The samples were exposed to ten absorbed doses (0.5-25 kGy) produced at high dose rates (600 and 1200 kGy h(-1) for accelerated electrons, as well as 22.5 and 37.5 kGy h(-1) for gamma radiation). The analysis by a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method indicated that the initial concentrations of pharmaceutical residues were effectively reduced by up to 90-100% in eighty per cent of the cases when samples were exposed to 0.5-5 kGy of electron beam or gamma radiation treatment. Higher doses (> 5 kGy) were needed to decompose macrolide antibiotics. The use of electron beam radiation showed some advantages due to the reduced exposure time, thus enabling a more energy efficient treatment resulting in the degradation of pharmaceutical residues comparable to that achieved by gamma irradiation. Microbiological studies indicated the pronounced degradation effect on bacterial contamination of wastewater, which was successfully eliminated upon increasing the radiation, dose up to 7-12 kGy.

AB The use of acoustic cavitation for water and wastewater treatment (cleaning) is a well known procedure. Yet, the use of hydrodynamic cavitation as a sole technique or in combination with other techniques such as ultrasound has only recently been suggested and employed.
   In the first part of this paper a general overview of techniques that employ hydrodynamic cavitation for cleaning of water and wastewater is presented.
   In the second part of the paper the focus is on our own most recent work using hydrodynamic cavitation for removal of pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, carbamazepine), toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa), green microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris), bacteria (Legionella pneumophila) and viruses (Rotavirus) from water and wastewater.
   As will be shown, hydrodynamic cavitation, like acoustic, can manifest itself in many different forms each having its own distinctive properties and mechanisms. This was until now neglected, which eventually led to poor performance of the technique. We will show that a different type of hydrodynamic cavitation (different removal mechanism) is required for successful removal of different pollutants.
   The path to use hydrodynamic cavitation as a routine water cleaning method is still long, but recent results have already shown great potential for optimisation, which could lead to a low energy tool for water and wastewater cleaning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical method was developed for the determination of nine antiviral drugs (acyclovir, abacavir, lamivudine, nevirapine oseltamivir, penciclovir, ribavirin, stavudine, zidovudine) and one active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) in raw and treated wastewater as well as in surface water using LC/ESI tandem MS detection. Relative recoveries exceeded 80% and limits of quantification ranged between 0.2 and 10 ng L-1. Matrix effects were compensated by the use of stable isotope labeled surrogate standards and optimized chromatographic separation on a Hydro-RP column. All antiviral drugs, except ribavirin, were detected in raw wastewater. A significant reduction in concentrations was observed for acyclovir, lamivudine, and abacavir in treated wastewater indicating a substantial removal, while nevirapine, zidovudine and oseltamivir were found in similar concentrations in raw and treated wastewater. Concentrations in river waters were in the lower ng L-1-range, with a maximum of 190 and 170 ng L-1 for acyclovir and zidovudine, respectively in the Hessian Ried. Estimated total compound loads in the Ruhr river ranged between <0.1 and 16.5 g d(-1) while for the Rhine river values between 370 and 1800 g d(-1) were determined. The ratios of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate were approximately a factor of 10 higher for the Rhine than for the otherrivers and streams indicating a significant contribution from other sources such as discharges from manufacturing facilities.

AB A novel bio-entrapped salt marsh sediment membrane reactor (BESMSMR) was evaluated for treating high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater, and membrane fouling behaviour was also assessed. The BESMSMR was operated in parallel with a conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR), and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) as well as an entrapped biomass MBR (bio-entrapped membrane reactor, BEMR) to facilitate a meaningful comparison of performance characteristics obtained in these reactor systems. Two hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 60 and 40,h with organic loading rates (OLRs) varied from 7.0 to 11.9 kg COD/m(3) d were tested. The pharmaceutical wastewater used has an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of 17,931 1851 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 20,881 2030 mg/L. The BESMSMR demonstrated the highest removal efficiencies of TCOD (78.481.3%), due to the ability of the marine sediment microorganisms seeded from coastal shores to thrive in the hyper-saline environment and degraded recalcitrant organic matter present in the pharmaceutical wastewater. The anoxic zone presented in the inner part of bio-carriers could have triggered the denitrification reaction, and thus improved the TN removal rate by 15-20%. Membrane fouling was reduced with lower concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the entrapped biomass MBRs. Proteins rather than carbohydrates were the main component of EPS and SMP in the MBR systems. The novel BESMSMR possesses the benefits of salt marsh sediment and an entrapped biomass technique that offered effective organic removal for the high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater and reduced membrane fouling.

AB The use of the ligninolytic fungi Trametes versicolor for the degradation of micropollutants has been widely studied. However, few studies have addressed the treatment of real wastewater containing pharmaceutically active compounds (PhAC) under non-sterile conditions. The main drawback of performing such treatments is the difficulty for the inoculated fungus to successfully compete with the other microorganisms growing in the bioreactor. Id the present study, several fungal treatments were performed under non-sterile conditions in continuous operational mode with two types of real wastewater effluent, namely, a reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) from a wastewater treatment plant and a veterinary hospital wastewater (VHW). In all cases, the setup consisted of two parallel reactors: one inoculated with T. versicolor and one non-inoculated, which was used as the control. The main objective of this work was to correlate the operational conditions and traditional monitoring parameters, such as laccase activity, with PhAC removal and the composition of the microbial communities developed inside the bioreactors. For that purpose a variety of biochemical and molecular biology analyses were performed: phospholipid fatty acids analysis (PLFA), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by sequencing. The results show that many indigenous fungi (and not only bacteria, which were the focus of the majority of previously published research) can successfully compete with the inoculated fungi (i.e., Trichoderma asperellum overtook T. versicolor in the ROC treatment). We also showed that the wastewater origin and the operational conditions had a stronger impact on the diversity of microbial communities developed in the bioreactors than the inoculation or not with T. versicolor.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment has a limited capacity to reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes (ARB&ARG). Tertiary treatment processes are promising solutions, although the transitory inactivation of bacteria may select ARB&ARG. This study aimed at assessing the potential of ozonation and UV254 nm radiation to inactivate cultivable fungal and bacterial populations, and the selected genes 16S rRNA (common to all bacteria), intl1 (common in Gram-negative bacteria) and the ARG vanA, bIa(TEM), sul1 and qnrS.
   The abundance of the different microbiological parameters per volume of wastewater was reduced by similar to 2 log units for cultivable fungi and 16S rRNA and intll genes, by similar to 3-4 log units, for total heterotrophs, enterobacteria and enterococci, and to values close or below the limits of quantification for ARG, for both processes, after a contact time of 30 min. Yet, most of the cultivable populations, the 16S rRNA and intll genes as well as the ARG, except qnrS after ozonation, reached pre-treatment levels after 3 days storage, suggesting a transitory rather than permanent microbial inactivation. Noticeably, normalization per 16S rRNA gene evidenced an increase of the ARG and intl1 prevalence, mainly after UV254 (nm) treatment. The results suggest that these tertiary treatments may be selecting for ARB&ARG populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study focuses on the removal of 22 selected micropollutants in an effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) at pilot scale. A reactor of 37 L with five low pressure mercury lamps emitting at 254 nm (UV254) was used. The 22 micropollutants include 15 pharmaceuticals, 2 X-Ray contrast medias, 1 corrosion inhibitor and 4 biocides/pesticides. Five of these 22 compounds were used as indicative substances as proposed by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) (carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, benzotriazole and mecoprop).
   Treatments included UV254 light alone, UV254 + H2O2 and UV254 H2O2+Fe3+. Wastewater coming from the MWTP already contained iron with an average total iron of 1.6 mg L-1. Original pH was not modified and remained between 6 and 7. The parameters changed during the experiments to find the optimal conditions were: wastewater flow rate (2-14 m(3) h(-)1) H2O2 concentration (20-50 mg L-1) and Fe (III) concentration (0-4 mg L-1). Chemicals removal rates were greater than 80% for the majority of the flow rates tested.
   Operating costs for the different conditions evaluated were also estimated and compared. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater effluents due to incomplete removal during the treatment processes may cause potential ecological and human health risks. This study evaluated the removal and uptake of seven EDCs spiked in two types of wastewater effluent (i.e., ultrafiltration and ozonation) and effluent cultivated with the freshwater green alga Nannochloris sp. In ultrafiltration effluent cultivated with Nannochloris sp. for 7 days, the removal rate of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and salicylic acid (SAL) was 60%; but Nannochloris sp. did not promote the removal of other EDCs studied. The algal-mediated removal of E2, EE2, and SAL was attributed to photodegradation and biodegradation. Triclosan (TCS) underwent rapid photodegradation regardless of adding algae in the effluent with 63%-100% removal within 7 days. Triclosan was also found associated with algal cells immediately after adding algae, and thus the primary mechanisms involved were photodegradation and bioremoval (i.e., bioadsorption and bioaccumulation). After algal cultivation, TCS still has a bioaccumulation potential to pose high risks within the food web and the endocrine disrupting properties of the residual estrogens in the effluent are not eliminated. Algal cultivation can be exploited to treat wastewater effluents but the removal efficiencies of EDCs highly depend on chemical types. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not able to remove completely some emerging contaminants, such as residual pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) with potential ecotoxicity to water bodies. An advanced bio-oxidation process (ABOP) using white-rot fungi (WRF) has been proposed as alternative biological treatment for degradation of non-biodegradable compounds. A synthetic and real wastewater spiked with 12 PCs at 50 mu g L-1 was treated by means of ABOP based on WRF in a rotating biological contactor (RBC) at 1 day of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The ABOP achieved a remarkable biological performance in terms of TOC removal and reduction of N-NH4+ and P-PO43- nutrients. Likewise, 5 of the 12 PCs were eliminated with removal efficiencies ranging from 80 to 95%, whereas 6 of 12 PCs were eliminated with removal values ranging from 50 to 70%. The anaerobic digestion of the fungal sludge generated upon the treatment was also evaluated, obtaining a methane yield of 250 mL CH4 g(VS)(-1). These results evidenced that the proposed ABOP is a promising alternative for the sustainable wastewater treatment of urban effluents, combining advanced oxidation with biological operation for the removal of emerging PCs and energy recovery.

AB To assess the stability of precursors of the chloramine disinfection byproduct N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) under conditions expected in effluent-dominated surface waters, effluent samples from four municipal wastewater treatment plants were subjected to chlorination and chloramination followed by incubation in the presence of inocula derived from activated sludge. Samples subjected to free chlorine disinfection showed lower initial concentrations of NDMA precursors than those that were not chlorinated or were disinfected with pre-formed chloramines. For chloraminated and control (unchlorinated) treatments, the concentration of NDMA precursors decreased by an average of 24% over the 30-day incubation in samples from three of the four facilities. At the fourth facility, where samples were collected on three different days, NDMA precursor concentrations decreased by approximately 80% in one sample and decreased by less than 20% in the other two samples. in contrast to the low reactivity of the NDMA precursors, NDMA disappeared within 30 days under the conditions employed in these experiments. These results and measurements made in an effluent-dominated river suggest that although NDMA may be removed after wastewater effluent is discharged, wastewater-derived NDMA precursors could persist long enough to form significant concentrations of NDMA in drinking water treatment plants that use water originating from sources that are subjected to wastewater effluent discharges.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ratio between COD and biomass (SO/Xo) on inert COD fraction in pharmaceutical wastewaters under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In this concept, wastewater diluted to 2000 mg.L-1 with the same initial COD and biomass concentration of 50 mg.L-1 were treated in batch reactors to determine the inert COD fraction. The pharmaceutical wastewater consists of a lot of volatile organic compounds, and high concentrations of COD may inhibit particularly the aerobic systems. The aerobic and anaerobic batch runs were operated for 37 days and 86 days, respectively [1]. The results of the aerobic inert COD experiment indicated that the biological removal was only 19%, and 81% of the initial COD level has been removed by air stripping. The anaerobic experiments were carried out at five different S-0/X-0 ratios and an efficiency of 88 % could be provided. It was seen that increasing S-0/X-0 ratios did not change the soluble inert COD (SI). Some unexpected peaks could be observed in raw wastewater, possibly originating from additive effects of particular wastewater fractions increasing COD by degradation or destroyed cell material. Additionally, the concentrations of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and their behavior in the inert systems were analyzed and discussed.

AB Current wastewater treatment is not designed for the elimination of micropollutants (MP) and therefore these are released into the aquatic environment by means of the municipal wastewater. The MicroStop project investigates a combination of a fixed-bed reactor (FBR) and a nanofiltration plant (NF) for the elimination of organic MP. NF acts as a barrier for MP while biological degradation of the pollutants is to be induced in the FBR. A simultaneous treatment of the retentate should be realized by its return to the FBR. The NF is to be supplied with energy by a large separation of organic matter in the primary clarification. The experiments showed that NF can eliminate more than 95% of the selected and detected MP on average, and therefore, this method represents a suitable barrier for these pollutants. The retentate of the NF was used to test the potential of the biological degradation in the FBR. The test results showed that a significant biological degradation of different MP took place in the FBR. The degradability of the substances could be verified by not detecting significant adsorption on sludge and fixed-bed. For certain MP (sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) only little potential of biodegradation could be detected, which is confirmed by values from the literature. Apart from these two substances, the average degradation rate was 78%. The successful MP-retention in connection with the biological degradation rates demonstrated the potential of the concept.
   Statement of Industrial Relevance It is undisputed that the conventional wastewater treatment has to be upgraded, since it is not able to eliminate residual MP. The following describes how the MicroStop-process is able to address MP where competitive processes such as activated carbon or ozonation fail to do so:
   The process is able to eliminate MP comprehensively and to retain microplastics, pathogenic germs and metabolites to a large extent before they reach the environment.
   The retentate, which normally occurs as residue of the NF, is directly treated in the FBR. The only residue of the MicroStop-process would be the excess sludge, which could easily be used for sludge treatment.
   The effluent of the process is of high quality. This could be used in other regions of the world for irrigating plants, for industrial processes or even as tap water.
   The potentially increased energy consumption (i.e., due to NF) is taken into account in our concept by the carbon extraction in the primary treatment.
   Novelty or Significance The combination of NF with biological degradation of MP in a FBR represents a process that has not yet been investigated in this form.
   In addition, the combination with an elevated carbon extraction in the primary treatment (Powerstep-process) represents the idea of a complete redesign of conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants.

AB In this study an impedimetric immunosensor was developed in order to determine ciprofloxacin (CIP) in wastewater samples, an emergent contaminant widely found in wastewater. To achieve this, an anti-ciprofloxacin antibody was immobilized on the surface of a printed carbon electrode. Then, the developed immunosensor was applied in wastewater samples from Universite Laval residences (Quebec, Canada) through the load transfer resistance (R-ct) using [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) as a redox probe, and the average CIP concentration was found to be 2.90 x 10(-4) mu g mL(-1). The observed R-ct changes presented a linear relationship from CIP concentrations of 10(-5) to 1.0 mu g mL(-1), with detection and quantification limits of 2.50 x 10(-6) and 7.90 x 10(-6) mu g mL(-1), respectively. The immunosensor presented high selectivity and repeatability, as well as a good recovery rate in wastewater samples (97%). Significant interference with other compounds was not observed. The proposed method requires only 30 mu L of sample without the use of organic solvents or preceding sample preparation and/or extraction techniques. Moreover, the method is fast: only 20 min of incubation followed by 2 min of analysis time was sufficient to obtain the CIP concentration. The method's estimated cost is U$ 2.00 per sample.

AB In this study, electrocoagulation process was performed using Al and Fe electrodes for personal care product (PCP) industry wastewater treatment. Response surface methodology approach using Central Composite Design was applied to develop a mathematical model and optimize process parameters (initial pH, current density and electrolysis time) for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS). The predicted values of models obtained using RSM were in good agreement with experimental data. The optimu m conditions for the COD removal were found to be pH of 8.03, current density of 58 mA/cm(2), electrolysis time of 33 with Al electrodes, whereas the optimum conditions were pH of 5.9, current density of 75 mA/cm(2), electrolysis time of 45 min with Fe electrodes. Under optimum conditions, 97.09% COD removal was obtained using Al electrodes and 98.76% COD removal was obtained using Fe electrodes. The operating costs for the COD removal from PCP wastewater by electrocoagulation process using Al and Fe electrodes at optimized conditions were calculated to be 3.75 and 3.86 sic/m(3), respectively. Additionally, the sludge samples formed in the process was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. According to FT-IR results, pollutants in PCP wastewater were linked to Al(OH)(3) and Fe(OH)(3) compounds.

AB Antibiotics used in both human and veterinary medicine make an important group of drugs. However. the use of these compounds causes their expansion into the environment, where there accumulate and develop their resistance. It is documented that they block biological processes in wastewater treatment plants. They also affect natural ecosystems and may concentrate in food chain.
   Sulfonamides (widely known as "sulfa drugs") were the first antimicrobial drugs used in medicine. They are derivates of p-aminobenzenesulfonamide and are used as antimicrobial drugs in both veterinary and human medicine. A large number of human and animal infectious diseases is treated by these compounds.
   The analysis of sulfonamides is highly influenced by their properties, mainly by their insolubility in water, ethanol, ether and dichloromethane.
   The samples were collected from the municipal and veterinary wastewater treatment plants in Brno, the Czech Republic. The simple extraction method for sulfonamides (sulfathiazole) in wastewater has been developed. Sulfathiazole was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethylacetate and evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The evaporation residues were dissolved in methanol and mobile phase. The mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water was used as the mobile phase. The samples were filtered into the amber glass vials through membrane filters. The HPLC instrument equipped with a diode array detector was used to perform the sample analysis.
   The concentration levels of sulfathiazole in real samples are discussed in this paper.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micropollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to reduce the discharge for priority substances and to meet the environmental quality standards set by the European Water Framework Directive. The present work assessed the occurrence of 60 organic substances (priority substances and other relevant pollutants) in municipal wastewater and sludge. Their fate in the treatment processes and their removal efficiencies Were quantified. Thorough on-site mass balances were carried out at 8 municipal wastewater treatment plants chosen among conventional and advanced secondary processes. It was found that 70% of the substances were quantified in raw wastewater and 50% in effluent, with a transfer without a limited degradation for most of them. Low loaded activated sludge (AS) process reduced the emission of more than half of micropollutants. At low sludge retention time (AS under high load), lower removal efficiencies were measured compared to low loaded AS. No influence of temperature of the biological reactor was shown. The membrane bioreactor process increased the removal efficiencies for one third of the substances that were partially removed with AS. Still, five substances were measured at concentrations exceeding the environmental quality standards at the outlet of the studied plants. In addition to efforts for source-reduction, complementary treatments need to be set-up.

AB The aim of the study was to detect and quantify selected antibacterial drugs in the raw and treated wastewater collected under various temperature conditions (i.e. winter and summer period) from two urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), located in the northern and southern part of Poland. An additional goal of the study was to estimate the effectiveness of the removal of these antibacterial drugs in the above-mentioned conditions. For the study were selected: clarithromycin (CLA), erythromycin (ERY), roxithromycin (ROX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (N-Ac-SMX), sulfamethoxine (SMN), sulfamerazine (SMR), tiamulin (TIA), and trimethoprim (TRP). The study showed that CLA, ERY, ROX, SMX, TRP, and N-Ac-SMX (main SMX metabolite) were detected in all wastewater samples, regardless of the place of collection and the season of the sampling, while SMN, SMR, and TIA were not detected in the investigated wastewater. The studies have shown that N-Ac-SMX was the most efficiently removed compound at both treatment plants, regardless of the process temperature (over 95%), however, this substance may reversibly transform into the origin form of SMX under the conditions prevailing at WWTPs, which means that the removal can be only apparent. In the study, the temperature was an important parameter affecting the removal efficiency of CLA, ROX, and TRP. The removal efficiency of these substances always has been higher in summer than in the winter period. The process was also slightly more effective at WWTP 2. At WWTP 2, the average removal for CLA, ROX, and TRP in the summer period was equal to 76%, 47%, and 38%, respectively. Erythromycin, was a substance that was not degraded in any of the investigated technological systems and no effect of temperature on the removal efficiency was observed.

AB The objectives of this study were to measure the sorption capacity of a dilute solution of drugs in water on hydrophobic zeolites and to quantify aspects of their adsorption mechanisms for potential use in wastewater remediation. The removal of three drugs, erythromycin (ERY), carbamazepine (CBZ) and levofloxacin (FLX) from water using three organophilic zeolites (Y, mordenite (MOR), ZSM-5) was investigated. Adsorption isotherms show that these three drugs are adsorbed in remarkable amounts by Y. These data were confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. The presence of these drugs inside the 1, cage was revealed by unit cell parameter variations and structural deformations obtained by X-ray structure analyses carried out using the Rietveld method on zeolite after adsorption. Our results indicate that the adsorption properties of zeolitic materials do not only depend on micropore size and that zeolite shape selectivity also depends on structural features which are difficult to determine "a priori". In order to test the ability of organophilic zeolites in removing drugs from wastewater, the adsorption of ERY, FLX and CBZ on zeolite Y from water samples collected at the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant located in Northern Italy was determined. These drugs were almost completely adsorbed by Y zeolite, confirming that this material is suitable for removing drugs from wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Farmers near towns and cities are using a wide range of highly polluted wastewaters for crop irrigation in Pakistan due to severe freshwater shortage. The present study aimed to promote indigenous bacterial strains isolated from domestic, hospital, textile, pharmaceutical and mixed wastewaters to remove contaminants and colour and render these wastewaters safer for irrigation. Thirty seven bacterial strains were isolated from five wastewater samples collected from different sites in Lahore, Pakistan. Under optimal growth conditions, three isolates (D6, D7 and P1) showed >93% decolourisation potential in the treatment of hospital wastewater. 16S rDNA sequencing identified two of these isolates (D6 and D7) as showing 100% and 99.86% homology to Bacillus paramycoides spp. - novel strains from B. cereus group. Isolate P1 showed 97.47% homology to Alcaligenes faecalis. GCMS analysis of the untreated hospital wastewater revealed the presence of pharmaceutic pollutants, i.e. Phenol (876 mu g/L), Salicylic acid (48 mu g/L), Caffeine (7 mu g/L), Naproxen (23 mu g/L), Octadecene (185 mu g/L) and Diazepam (14 mu g/L). The analysis of treated hospital wastewaters showed percentage degradation of pharmaceutic pollutants (100%-43%) and significant reduction in the BOD5 (91%-68%), COD (89%-52%) and heavy metals concentrations. These strains therefore can represent a low-cost and low-tech alternative to bioremediate complex matrices of hospital wastewater prior to crop irrigation to support the achievement of clean re-usable water in developing countries like Pakistan.

AB Herein we report the analysis of 27 selected psychoactive compounds found in the wastewater of the largest suburb in the eastern part of Central Europe Bratislava-Petrzalka, Slovakia. Thirteen of them (MDMA, metham-phetarnine, amphetamine, THC-COOH, benzoylecgonine, codeine, tramadol, venlafaxine, oxazepam, citalopram, methadone, EDDP, cocaine) were found in concentrations above 30 ng/L These compounds were selected for further monitoring. The possibility of complete degradation of these 13 substances by zerovalent iron and iron(VI) was studied in the wastewater from the Petrzalka treatment plant During the week the concentration of the majority of the studied compounds in wastewater was stable. Concentrations of MDMA, cocaine, tramadol, and oxazepam reached significantly higher levels during the weekend. Only about 10% removal efficiency for tramadol, venlafaxine, oxazepam, MDMA, citalopram, methadone, and EDDP was observed at the treatment plant In contrast, methamphetamine, amphetamine, and codeine were removed with 68%, 83%, and 53% efficiency, respectively. The degradation of synthetic drugs (methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA) in wastewater is limited, while cannabis (of natural biological origin) is degraded with efficiency greater than 90%. After utilization of the Fenton reaction, its modification, and use of ferrate(VI), a high efficiency of eliminating all of these substances to values below the limit of detection was achieved.

AB This paper evaluated the effect of mixing the effluent of a pharmaceutical plant producing acetylsalicylic acid with tannery wastewater, on the biodegradation of the effluents. The evaluation involved the analysis of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), profiles of each wastewater and the mixture by respirometry. Model calibration using the experimental OUR data identified major COD fractions and associated process kinetics for all samples analyzed. The tannery sample was a plain-settled effluent having a total COD of around 2200 mg/L with a readily biodegradable fraction of 15%. The same fraction was 57% in the pharmaceutical wastewater sample having a much stronger total COD content of 40,435 mg/L. Consequently, mixing of the pharmaceutical effluent with the tannery wastewater up to 38% of the total COD in the mixture increased the readily biodegradable COD fraction but had an inhibitory effect on the biodegradation kinetics. This effect was relatively lower on growth, but quite significant on the hydrolysis of the slowly biodegradable COD decreasing the maximum hydrolysis rate from 2.0 day(-1) to 1.2 day(-1). Model evaluation of the respirometric data, as performed in this study sets a workable protocol for the assessment of the compatibility of different wastewater mixtures for biological treatability.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are now routinely detected in raw and treated municipal wastewater. Since conventional wastewater treatment processes are not particularly effective for PPCP removal, treated wastewater discharges are the main entry points for PPCPs into the environment, and eventually into our drinking water. This study investigates the use of laccase-catalyzed oxidation for removing low concentrations of PPCPs from municipal wastewater primary effluent. Oxybenzone was selected as a representative PPCP. Like many other PPCPs, it is not recognized directly by the laccase enzyme. Therefore, mediators were used to expand the oxidative range of laccase, and the efficacy of this laccase mediator system in primary effluent was evaluated. Eight potential mediators were investigated, and 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), a synthetic mediator, and acetosyringone (ACE), a natural mediator, provided the greatest oxybenzone removal efficiencies. An environmentally relevant concentration of oxybenzone (43.8 nM, 10 mu g/L) in primary effluent was completely removed (below the detection limit) after two hours of treatment with ABTS, and 95% was removed after two hours of treatment with ACE. Several mediator/oxybenzone molar ratios were investigated at two different initial oxybenzone concentrations. Higher mediator/oxybenzone molar ratios were required at the lower (environmentally relevant) oxybenzone concentration, and ACE required higher molar ratios than ABTS to achieve comparable oxybenzone removal. Oxybenzone oxidation byproducts generated by the laccase-mediator system were characterized and compared to those generated during ozonation. Enzymatic treatment generated byproducts with higher mass to charge (m/z) ratios, likely due to oxidative coupling reactions. The results of this study suggest that, with further development, the laccase mediator system has the potential to extend the treatment range of laccase to PPCPs not directly recognized by the enzyme, even in a primary effluent matrix.

AB This study shows the evaluation of the possible use of the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha for the removal of some recalcitrant contaminants, namely many pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse that are not sufficiently removed from civil wastewaters. This mollusk has an enormous filtering capability and is highly resistant to natural and anthropogenic stresses and to a significant bioaccumulation of lipophilic contaminants. All these characteristics may be particularly useful for the removal of compounds not easily eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment processes. To verify this hypothesis an experimental study was conducted at the pilot scale using a pilot plant installed in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Milan (Milano-Nosedo, Italy). First, we presented results obtained in several preliminary tests in order to evaluate the capability of zebra mussel specimens to survive in different wastewater mixtures, its filtering capacity and the possible influence of bio- and photo-degradation in the abatement of the molecules of interest. Finally, data obtained in the final tests demonstrated a capacity of this filter-feeder to reduce the concentrations of several pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse higher than that obtained by the simple natural sedimentation, suggesting a possible implementation of the bio-filtration process in wastewater management.

AB Photo solid-phase microextraction (photo-SPME) is applied for the first time to study the photochemical behavior of an emerging pollutant, triclosan, in real contaminated wastewater samples using a solar simulator. In this study, water samples are extracted by SPME and then, the fiber coating is irradiated for a selected time. This on-fiber procedure, so-called photo-SPME, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry makes it possible to study photodegradation kinetics and the generation of byproducts. Several photoproducts were identified in the real samples including the 2,8-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, dichlorophenols and a compound tentatively identified as other DCDD congener or a dichlorohydroxydibenzofuran. Accordingly, it was possible to postulate main photodegradation mechanisms. Photo-SPME demonstrated slower kinetics in wastewater than in spiked ultrapure water probably due to the presence of dissolved organic matter. This technique was extensively compared with conventional aqueous photodegradation showing high similarity. The influence of pH on the triclosan photolysis and on the triclosan-dioxin conversion was also investigated in wastewater. Photodegradation of triclosan and formation of 2,8-DCDD occurred independently of sample pH. This study represents an advance in the use of photo-SPME to understand the photochemical fate of environmental organic pollutants and demonstrates its clear advantages with real samples.

AB The bulk manufacturing of carbamazepine (CBZ) by pharmaceutical manufacturing industries leads to generation of huge amount of wastewater containing this recalcitrant compound. This necessitates the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as a pretreatment strategy for the treatment of such complex industrial wastewaters. Therefore, in the present study, effect of Fenton treatment was investigated for removal of CBZ from real wastewater containing higher CBZ concentrations. The preliminary studies were conducted to assess the significant factors in Fenton treatment and pH, Fenton dose and time were found to be statistically significant parameters affecting the Fenton process. Based on these results, further experimental trials were designed statistically using Central Composite Design in MINITAB 16 software. The process conditions were optimized using Response Surface Optimizer Tool in MINITAB 16 and pH = 3.5 and H2O2 concentration of 8.5 g/L was obtained as optimum condition leading to 49.39 +/- 0.93% CBZ removal from pharmaceutical wastewater containing higher CBZ concentrations. The detoxification of Fenton-treated wastewater through granulated activated carbon (GAC) column resulted in an overall CBZ removal of 99.51 +/- 0.02%. The detoxification was further corroborated through seed germination test which demonstrated a potential reduction in toxicity post-detoxification using GACs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work aimed to compare the adsorptive removal of diclofenac from ultrapure and wastewater by different adsorbents. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out using two different activated carbons (GPP20 and WP70, from Chemviron Carbon) and a non-ionic polymeric resin (SP207, from Resindion). The pseudo-second-order equation fitted the kinetic experimental results and the corresponding k(2) (gmg(-1)min(-1)) determined for the activated carbons was one order of magnitude higher than for the polymeric resin. The equilibrium results were fitted by the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. The determined maximum adsorption capacity (Q(m), mgg(-1)) and the adsorbent-adsorbate affinity parameter (K-LF, mgg(-1) (mgL(-1))(-1/n)) were one order of magnitude higher for the activated carbons than for the polymeric resin. With respect to the influence of the aqueous matrix, both the k(2) and the Q(m) remained the same in ultrapure as in wastewater. Differently, the K-LF showed one order of magnitude higher values in waste than in ultrapure water. WP270 displayed the best adsorptive performance providing 0.00106gmg(-1)min(-1) (k(2)), 315mgg(-1) (Q(m)), and 1.7mgg(-1) (mgL(-1))(-1/n) (K-LF) for the adsorption of diclofenac from wastewater. These results support the practical application of activated carbon for the removal of diclofenac during the tertiary treatment of waste effluents.

AB In this paper, the flow dynamic behavior of the filter press electrochemical reactor (FPECR) has been investigated for the treatment of liquid biomedical wastewater. The residence time distribution is utilized as a tool to investigate the flow dynamic behavior of the electrolyte within the reactor. The reactor is operated at different current densities of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A/dm(2) with RuO2/Ti as an electrode by varying flow rates such as 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 L/h. Impacts of various flow rates on flow dynamics were examined. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the presence of a dead volume and short-circuiting in the reactor were reduced for the lowest flow rate of 20 L/h in the reactor at 10 A/dm(2). The potential of the FPECR was experimentally validated by analyzing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, total dissolved solids, and total suspended solids emanating from the wastewater. Findings of this study reveal that maximum COD reduction of about 94% was achieved with a maximum current efficiency of 18.47% at a flow rate of 20 L/h which has good mixing and less back mixing condition inside the reactor. The experimental findings prove that the FPECR can be used for the treatment of pharmaceutical-based liquid biomedical waste and can achieve the quality of the standards prescribed for reuse of biomedical wastewater.

AB The study examined the feasibility of using combined TiO2 photocatalysis (UV/TiO2/H2O2) and sequencing batch biological reactor (SBR) process for treatment of an antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin. In the first part of the study, the effect of TiO2 and H2O2 dose on the UV/TiO2/H2O2 process was evaluated. The best TiO2 and H2O2 dose were observed to be 1000 and 250 mg/L, respectively. Under the best TiO2 and H2O2 dose and pH 5, HPLC analysis confirmed complete degradation of both antibiotics in 30 min. In the second part of the study, the effect of UV/TiO2/H2O2 treated wastewater characteristics under different UV/TiO2/H2O2 operating conditions and SBR cycle period on SBR and combined process performance were evaluated. Increasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 24 to 48 hr significantly improved SBR efficiency. Under the best operating conditions (H2O2 dose 250 mg/L, TiO2 dose 1000 mg/L, pH 5, irradiation time 5 hr and HRT 48 hr), the combined UV/H2O2/TiO2-SBR process achieved an overall efficiency of 57% in terms of sCOD removal and final sCOD of the effluent was 236 mg/L Based on the results, the feasibility of using combined UV/H2O2/TiO2-SBR process for treatment of antibiotic wastewater containing amoxicillin and cloxacillin is limited.

AB The applicability of Fenton's oxidation to improve the biodegradability of a pharmaceutical wastewater to be treated biologically was investigated. The wastewater was originated from a factory producing a variety of pharmaceutical chemicals. Treatability studies were conducted under laboratory conditions with all chemicals (having COD varying from 900 to 7000 mg/L) produced in the factory in order to determine the operational conditions to utilize in the full-scale treatment plant. Optimum pH was determined as 3.5 and 7.0 for the first (oxidation) and second stage (coagulation) of the Fenton process, respectively. For all chemicals, COD removal efficiency was highest when the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ was 150-250. At H2O2/Fe2+ ratio of 155, 0.3 M H2O2 and 0.002 M Fe2+, provided 45-65% COD removal.
   The wastewater treatment plant that employs Fenton oxidation followed by aerobic degradation in sequencing batch reactors (SBR), built after these treatability studies provided an overall COD removal efficiency of 98%, and compliance with the discharge limits. The efficiency of the Fenton's oxidation was around 45-50% and the efficiency in the SBR system which has two reactors each having a volume of 8 m(3) and operated with a total cycle time of 1 day, was around 98%, regarding the COD removal.

AB Private wells in Ireland and elsewhere have been shown to be prone to microbial contamination with the main suspected sources being practices associated with agriculture and domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTS). While the microbial quality of private well water is commonly assessed using faecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, such organisms are not usually source-specific, and hence cannot definitively conclude the exact origin of the contamination. This research assessed a range of different chemical contamination fingerprinting techniques (ionic ratios, artificial sweeteners, caffeine, fluorescent whitening compounds, faecal sterol profiles and pharmaceuticals) as to their use to apportion contamination of private wells between human wastewater and animal husbandry wastes in rural areas of Ireland. A one-off sampling and analysis campaign of 212 private wells found that 15% were contaminated with E. coli. More extensive monitoring of 24 selected wells found 58% to be contaminated with E. coli on at least one occasion over a 14-month period. The application of fingerprinting techniques to these monitored wells found that the use of chloride/bromide and potassium/sodium ratios is a useful low-cost fingerprinting technique capable of identifying impacts from human wastewater and organic agricultural contamination, respectively. The artificial sweetener acesulfame was detected on several occasions in a number of monitored wells, indicating its conservative nature and potential use as a fingerprinting technique for human wastewater. However, neither fluorescent whitening compounds nor caffeine were detected in any wells, and faecal sterol profiles proved inconclusive, suggesting limited suitability for the conditions investigated.

AB Xenobiotics are man-made, non-biodegradable compounds present in the environment at higher concentrations than usual. Phenols, dyes, surfactants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals are some of the xenobiotics. These pollutants have an adverse effect on the environment because of their toxicity, complex structure and carcinogenic nature and are not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Researchers round the globe have demonstrated various physical and chemical methods for the treatment of xenobiotics. This mini-review focuses on the application of electrocoagulation for the removal of xenobiotics. Different operating parameters that affect the removal efficiency, the types of electrodes used and the treatment cost of xenobiotics are elaborated in this article.

AB As attention is drawn towards the monitoring of the so-called emerging pollutants, some common household chemicals are not well researched. Household antimicrobials can also present wastewater treatment challenges if not taken cognisance of. Herein we report the application of a recently reported coupled dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) with supported liquid phase micro-extraction (LPME) for the extraction of triclosan from wastewater. A univariate approach was used to investigate various parameters amenable to DLLME while no attempt was made to optimise the LPME, achieving the following optimum conditions: 25 mu L of a 1:1 toluene-chloroform mixture with 10% sodium chloride into 1 mL aqueous triclosan solutions and extraction time of 15 min achieving an enrichment efficiency 167 times the reference solution prepared with distilled water, good linearity (R-2 = 0.9946) with the estimated limit of detection at 0.013 mu g/mL and good repeatability (%RSD <= 10). The method showed considerable ruggedness with a similar linearity (R-2 = 0.9957) and repeatability (%RSD < 10), with only the limit of detection being compromised (0.31 mu g/mL) when applied to a wastewater sample using a matrix-matched standard addition approach. Although the GC-FID method detected triclosan in the wastewater sample, the results were negated by those from the GC-MS; as such it therefore could not be concluded with confidence whether the water contained any triclosan or not. However, the results demonstrated the potential of this method in determination of triclosan in water-based samples when the extraction was coupled to a more rugged system such as a GC-MS.

LA English
DT Article
ID AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; METABOLITES; WATER; DEGRADATION
AB The European Medicines Agency guideline for the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products provides a step-by-step phased approach to evaluate the potential risks of new medicines to the environment Phase I ("prescreen") estimates the initial exposure of the new medicine in the environment. Phase II A ("screen") estimates the fate and effects in the environment The fate screen determines the inherent properties of the new medicinal active ingredient to sorb to sludge, soil, and sediment matrices and its potential to degrade in a sewage treatment plant and in the subsequent water-sediment compartment Current ERA Guidance (2006) recommends the OECD 301B Ready Biodegradation Test for Phase II Tier A testing without a clear recommendation for Phase II Tier B testing when further refinement may be needed. With the recent approval of the OECD 314B method for activated sludge, there is now an alternative test method that may be better suited for Phase II Tier A testing and to the data needs of the ERA. As a batch test, it fits the needs of a Tier A screen. It is not designed to simulate the operational steps of a sewage treatment plant such as the OECD 303 tests, and yet provides the following without considerable costs or resources of OECD 303: (1) useful kinetic information in a test that reflects the conditions of the sewage-treatment environment i.e., realistic biomass solids concentrations and low level test material concentrations to simulate first-order (nongrowth) kinetics, (2) mass balance analysis for CO(2) evolution and for residues found in mixed liquor, (3) use of an abiotic control to assess losses other than those attributed to biotic biodegradation, and (4) biotransformation profile of degradants. This paper presents the results of OECD 301B with that of OECD 314B for activated sludge biodegradation for five Pfizer drug substances. The use of this new method as an alternative to OECD 301B would strengthen the fate testing screen in Phase II Tier A of the EMEA ERA. It would provide a characterization of a substance's potential for biotransformation and mineralization during sewage treatment and provide a means for revising predicted environmental concentration of surface water for amount removed during sewage treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are molecules used for the treatment of physiological disorders that can generate environmental imbalances when discharged into wastewater. In this work, the use of Penicillium oxalicum XD-3.1 as bioremediation tool for the elimination of PhACs in non-sterile real hospital wastewater in batch bench scale bioreactor and its impact on microbial community was evaluated. A quantitative analysis using UHPLC-QToF was performed under three different conditions to determine the elimination of the different (PhACs) by this ascomycetes fungus. On the other hand, the changes on microbial community over time were analysed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform and a phylogenetic microarray (PhyloChip). P. oxalicum XD 3.1 was able to reduce the concentration of the majority of the analysed PhACs in 24 h such as ketoprofen, naproxen and paracetamol. Moreover, P. oxalicum inhibited the native fungal populations present in the wastewater, including opportunistic human pathogens such as Mycosphaerella and Drechslera, as well as some bacterial human pathogens belonging to Clostridiaceae and Brucellaceae families. However, important degraders such as Pseudomonadaceae bacteria groups remained in the system, indicating a possible natural consortium formation between fungi and bacteria. These results indicate the possibility to use this system for the removal of PhACs in real applications.

AB Laccases were studied for their ability to remove two compounds, 2-chlorophenol and sulfamethoxazole, in batch studies, both in buffered solutions and in wastewater samples from different points in a municipal water resource recovery facility. Two enzymes with and without a mediator (acetosyringone) were investigated: a commercial product derived from Myceliphthora thermophile and a laboratory-generated enzyme mix derived from Tramates versicolor. The chlorophenol was removed rapidly by the commercial enzyme in the presence of acetosyringone, but the primary products were coupling complexes of the reactants. Excellent removal was achieved without acetosyringone by the natural enzyme mix. Sulfamethoxazole was poorly removed in all laboratory-generated chemically buffered solutions, but was very well removed, without the addition of mediators, in secondary effluent suspensions from a municipal water resource recovery facility. Mechanistic studies are still required, but the results suggest that treatment via direct addition of enzymes is feasible to remove recalcitrant compounds in municipal wastewater.

AB A vast number of persistent organic pollutants have been found in wastewater effluent, surface water, and drinking water around the world. This indicates their ineffective removal from water and wastewater using conventional treatment technologies. In addition to classical persistent organics such as organochlorine insecticides, solvents, and polychlorinated biphenyls, a growing number of emerging pollutants of both synthetic and natural origins have been identified as major environmental pollutants in recent years. A variety of advanced and conventional treatment options have been suggested for the removal and/or destruction of these persistent organics in water and wastewater, such as chemical oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration. Of these options, chemical oxidation using ozone, alone or in combination with additional physical/chemical agents (i.e., advanced oxidation), has been proved a highly effective treatment process for a wide spectrum of emerging aqueous organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, surfactants, microbial toxins, and natural fatty acids. In this paper, we discuss the emerging organic pollutants of concern in the aquatic environment and focus on the issues associated with their removal using ozonation and advanced oxidation processes.

AB This study revealed the recovery process of an anaerobic-aerobic wastewater treatment system, which was seriously inhibited by oxytetracycline at 200 mg/L, over a period of 91 days after the antibiotic potency in the wastewater was removed through enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment (85 celcius for 6 h). The organic loading rate (OLR) of the upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor was maintained at 2 g COD/L/d for 36 days in the first recovery stage, and gradually increased to 10 g COD/L/d in 4 steps. The UASB reactor fully restored its soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal performance in the first stage, which was accompanied by the rebound of the hydrolysis/fermentation/acetogenesis bacteria, including vadinHA17_norank, Mesotoga, Longilinea, Anaerolineaceae_norank, Lentimicrobiu, Blvii28_wastewater-sludge_group, and Synergistaceae_norank. In the aerobic reactor receiving the effluent from the UASB reactor, stable SCOD removal occurred on day 54 and complete nitrification occurred on day 64 at an OLR and ammonia load of 0.147 g COD/L/d and 0.015 g N/L/d, respectively. The resistome abundances in the UASB and aerobic reactors decreased from 1.01 (copies/16S rRNA gene) and 1.11 to 2.7 x 10-1 and 3.0 x 10-1, respectively, over the whole experimental period. The relatively high resistome levels in the final stage might be associated with the adsorbed oxytetracycline in both reactors (7.4 +/- 0.3 g/Kg and 0.7 +/- 0.2 g/Kg, respectively). The result demonstrated that, for the biological systems damaged by high concentrations of antibiotics, their wastewater treatment functions could be recovered easily by removing influent antibiotics, but the further reduction of resistant determinants depended on the removal of adsorbed antibiotics.

AB With the recent emergence of estrogenic contaminants as reclaimed wastewater quality issue, our study has investigated the removal of bisphenol-A (BPA) using a submerged membrane bioreactor. Experiments were performed at initial BPA concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 15 mg/L. A very low sludge mineralization occurred in the bioreactor (with a VSS/TSS ratio around 0.8-0.9), irrespective of the variation of biomass concentration and a long retention time of solids. The specific oxygen uptake rate values recorded did not reveal any significant change in the microbial respiratory activity in the absence (2.00 mg O-2/g VSS h) and in the presence (1.4 mg O-2/g VSS h) of BPA in the synthetic effluent. The performance of the bioreactor in terms of COD removal remained constant and reached 99% irrespective of the hydraulic retention time imposed (3-6 h), whereas 66-99% of COD removal was recorded while using conventional activated sludge system. The limit of the toxicity (21.6 g BPA/m(3)/d) determined for the bioreactor membrane system was higher than that recorded for the conventional activated sludge (2.5 g BPA/m(3)/d). BPA was effectively removed in the membrane bioreactor (abatement >= 98% was reached) due to adsorption and biodegradation/transformation processes. Residual BPA concentrations recorded in the mixed liquor remained low (0.017-0.004 mg/L), when the raw wastewater contained a concentration of 1.0 mg BPA/L. This indicates that BPA was not accumulated in the membrane bioreactor, but bacteria oxidized it. Likewise, the membrane bioreactor was found to be effective in removing ammonia-nitrogen (>99% of N-NH4 removed), whereas 61% of phosphate (P-PO4) could be simultaneously removed. The membrane bioreactor was a total barrier for total suspended solid and turbidity was effectively removed (residual turbidity was lower than 1.0 NTU). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study surveyed the hospital wastewater characters focusing on antibiotic contamination in seven hospitals in Bangkok. It detected 19 antibiotics of which the high-frequent detection were quinolones such as ofloxacin + levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin including sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared the highest concentrations of 12.11 and 9.60 mu g/L, respectively. Most antibiotic concentrations in the wastewaters of the studied hospitals gave a good correlation (r(2) = 0.77-0.99) to the amount of usage. In this study, batch acute toxicity tests were performed to assess the toxicity of hospital wastewater on mixed liquor, freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus quadricauda), and microcrustacean (Moina macrocopa). The hospital wastewaters could inhibit the mixed liquor growth and gave similar toxic levels among test species: algae and microcrustacean (9.81-13.63 and 2.62-3.09 TU, respectively). The conventional activated sludge (CAS) and rotating biological contactor (RBC) could remove fluoroquinolones and tetracycline via biomass adsorption. After treatment, most of treatment could reduce the toxicity. Nevertheless, the effluent gave slight toxicity on some test species which might be caused from chlorination and a common toxicant (NH3-N).

AB Sewage treatment plants effluent is considered the primary source of many micropollutants in aquatic systems since their biological treatment is commonly unable to remove persistent micropollutants. However, its efficacy can be achieved with the aid of advanced treatment technologies, such as membrane processes. This work evaluated the removal efficiency of 7 pharmaceuticals (Ketoprofen, Prednisone, Fenofibrate, Fluconazole, Betamethasone, Loratadine and 17 alpha-Ethinyl estradiol) in a hybrid system (EGSB-MBR) where an ultrafiltration membrane was submerged in an anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. This integrated system improved the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals (>84 %) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The EGSB reactor alone showed COD reductions around 92 %, while the EGSB-MBR system achieved COD reductions above 98 %. Furthermore, the permeate showed lower concentrations of nutrients (P, N-NH4+) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) than the effluent from the anaerobic reactor alone. Anaerobic biodegradability tests, together with bioreactor results, pointed out the mechanisms involved in the removal of each drug. The risk assessment showed that the permeate presented a low probability of risk to human health and that the OF membrane was able to reduce the risk of the final effluent.

AB Once discharged into the sewage system, many pharmaceuticals may undergo degradation reactions in the presence of chemical disinfectants, generating by-products that may possess enhanced toxicity relative to the parent compounds. For this reason, the stability of the widely used cytostatic etoposide in chlorinated water has been investigated for the first time in the present work. Taking advantage of the high-resolution/accurate-mass capabilities of the hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer Q Exactive, two new oxidation by-products of etoposide were reliably identified. The time course of etoposide and its by-products was followed at different pH values, free chlorine concentrations and water matrices. Finally, the occurrence of etoposide and its major identified by-product (3'-O-desmethyl etoposide) was investigated in real water samples by on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a 4000QTRAP hybrid quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The etoposide by-product was found in various river and wastewater samples at levels between 14 and 33 ng L-1, whereas etoposide was not detected in any sample. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Groundwater pollution by emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), has caused increasing concerns around the world. The vadose zone is an active zone where lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere interact. It is an important medium for PPCPs removal and entry into groundwater from irrigation using wastewater or polluted surface water. In the present study, the occurrence and distribution of eleven PPCPs in areas with a vadose zone (up to 16 m) was investigated from wastewater irrigated farmland, groundwater irrigated farmland and a seasonal river course in Beijing (China). Nine out of eleven PPCPs were detectable, and carbamazepine and caffeine had the highest detection frequencies, above 50%. The PPCPs were detectable deep in 16 m below ground level (bgl), and their concentrations ranged from bLOD (limit of detection) to 12.5 mu g/kg. Compared to the vadose zone soils irrigated with groundwater, wastewater-irrigated vadose zone soils had significantly higher PPCPs detection frequencies and contamination levels, suggesting the important roles of irrigation water sources on PPCPs accumulation and transport in the vadose zone. Additionally, PPCPs vertical distribution presented a bell-shape pattern in the vadose zone soils with wastewater irrigation, peaking at 3-6 m bgl. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated a significant correlation between PPCPs concentrations in the vadose zone soils and geochemical variables, including available potassium and silt content. This study provides important evidence on the influential factors of PPCPs accumulation and migration in the vadose zone soils resulted from wastewater irrigation. The incomplete removal of PPCPs poses certain risks in subsurface environment, potentially challenging groundwater quality and drinking water safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have a limited capacity to eliminate micropollutants. One option to improve this is tertiary treatment. Accordingly, the WWTP Eriskirch at the German river Schussen has been upgraded with different combinations of ozonation, sand, and granulated activated carbon filtration. In this study, the removal of endocrine and genotoxic effects in vitro and reproductive toxicity in vivo was assessed in a 2-year long-term monitoring. All experiments were performed with aqueous and solid-phase extracted water samples. Untreated wastewater affected several endocrine endpoints in reporter gene assays. The conventional treatment removed the estrogenic and androgenic activity by 77 and 95 %, respectively. Nevertheless, high anti-estrogenic activities and reproductive toxicity persisted. All advanced treatment technologies further reduced the estrogenic activities by additional 69-86 % compared to conventional treatment, resulting in a complete removal of up to 97 %. In the Ames assay, we detected an ozone-induced mutagenicity, which was removed by subsequent filtration. This demonstrates that a post treatment to ozonation is needed to minimize toxic oxidative transformation products. In the reproduction test with the mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a decreased number of embryos was observed for all wastewater samples. This indicates that reproductive toxicants were eliminated by neither the conventional nor the advanced treatment. Furthermore, aqueous samples showed higher anti-estrogenic and reproductive toxicity than extracted samples, indicating that the causative compounds are not extractable or were lost during extraction. This underlines the importance of the adequate handling of wastewater samples. Taken together, this study demonstrates that combinations of multiple advanced technologies reduce endocrine effects in vitro. However, they did not remove in vitro anti-estrogenicity and in vivo reproductive toxicity. This implies that a further optimization of advanced wastewater treatment is needed that goes beyond combining available technologies.

AB Domestic drinking water wells serve 44 million people in the US and are common globally. They are often located in areas served by onsite wastewater treatment systems, including septic systems, which can be sources of biological and chemical pollutants to groundwater. In this study we tested 20 domestic drinking water wells in a sand and gravel aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, for 117 organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) and for inorganic markers of septic system impact. We detected 27 OWCs, including 12 pharmaceuticals, five per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), four organophosphate flame retardants, and an artificial sweetener (acesulfame). Maximum concentrations of several PFASs and pharmaceuticals were relatively high compared to public drinking water supplies in the US. The number of detected OWCs and total concentrations of pharmaceuticals and of PFASs were positively correlated with nitrate, boron, and acesulfame and negatively correlated with well depth. These wells were all located in areas served exclusively by onsite wastewater treatment systems, which are likely the main source of the OWCs in these wells, although landfill leachate may also be a source. Our results suggest that current regulations to protect domestic wells from pathogens in septic system discharges do not prevent OWCs from reaching domestic wells, and that nitrate, a commonly measured drinking water contaminant, is a useful screening tool for OWCs in domestic wells. Nitrate concentrations of 1 mg/L NO3-N, which are tenfold higher than local background and tenfold lower than the US federal drinking water standard, were associated with wastewater impacts from OWCs in this study.

DE Membrane distillation; Potable water reuse; Organic transport;

AB In this study, the feasibility of the membrane distillation (MD) process as a wastewater reclamation system for portable reuse was investigated. The flux was stably maintained at about 20 L/m(2)h (LMH) at Delta T 30 degrees C, compared to higher flux at Delta T 50 degrees C, which showed a rapid decrease in the flux due to severe fouling. MD produced excellent quality of potable water satisfied the drinking water standards of Korea from effluent of sewage treatment plant (ESTP). The fractions of the hydrophobic OC (HOC) and chromatographic DOC (CDOC) from LC-OCD analysis was firstly suggested to understand different organic transport during the MD process. The transport of organic matters across the MD membrane mitigated at low operation temperature and the transported organics in all the tested waters were mostly volatile low molecular weight organics, aromatic amino acids. All of thirteen selected pharmaceuticals were completely removed by MD, regardless of their properties. In order to retard the membrane fouling of the MD process, coagulation and filtration pre-treatments were applied. The pre-treatment process coupled MD process could successfully remove impurities including NH4-N without severe membrane fouling. Moreover, coagulation pretreatment reduced transport of ammonia due to decrease in pH.

AB Fifteen antibiotics, including seven sulfonamides (SAs); three macrolides (MLs); three quinolones (QNs); one lincosamide, lincomycin (LIN); and one tetracycline (TC), were detected in the surface water of the Xi'an section of the Weihe River by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The detection rates were 12.50-100%, and the detected concentrations were in the range of nd-270.60 ng/L. The average detected concentrations of the SAs, MLs, QNs, LIN and TC were 113.68, 111.79, 20.55, 23.81 and 25.66 ng/L, respectively. Among these, SAs and MLs were the dominant antibiotics detected in the Weihe River. Compared with those in other water bodies in China and abroad, the antibiotic residues in the Weihe River were at a moderate contamination level. The SAs concentration distribution followed upstream > midstream > downstream, while the MLs concentration distribution was midstream < downstream < upstream. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that domestic sewage, livestock discharge, and aquaculture and pharmaceutical wastewater are the main sources of antibiotic residues in the Weihe River. In addition, the detected ciprofloxacin (CFX), ofloxacin (OFX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) pose high ecological risk in the short and long term.

AB The presence of antibiotic traces in the aquatic system due to the inefficient treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater represented threats, such as bioaccumulation and antibiotic-resistance, to the environment and human health. Accordingly, for the first time, the current work utilized the photocatalytic degradation and the adsorption approach for Levofloxacin (LEVO) in pharmaceutical wastewater using new designed nano aspects. Therefore, spherical Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP) sized 17 nm and ultrathin sheet-like structure graphene oxide nanosheets (GONS) with layer thickness similar to 5 nm were fabricated separately or in a combination between them then characterized via Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transforms Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), absorption spectra (UV-Vis) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Additionally, several parameters were investigated to evaluate the potential of the removal process, such as pH, the exposure time to UV radiation, the type and concentration of the nanoparticles (NPs) and the initial concentration of the drug using a mixed fractional factorial design. The most effective parameter for LEVO removal was the NPs type followed by the initial drug concentration. Furthermore, an RP-HPLC/UV method was developed and validated for measuring the percentage of removal for LEVO drug. The highest percentage removal for both 50 and 400 mu g mL(-1) LEVO was 99.2% and 99.6%, respectively, which was achieved using ZnONP/GONS combination at pH 9 +/- 0.05 and UV light exposure time 120 min. In addition, the negative antibacterial activity of the treated wastewater sample confirmed the drug removal. The established protocol was successfully applied on wastewater samples collected from a pharmaceutical company that encouraged researchers to mainstream this design to be applied on other pharmaceutical wastewater drugs.

AB Progesterone (P4) and synthetic progestins (gestagens) from contraceptives and hormone therapy occur in treated wastewater and surface water, and they may have adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Little is known about the molecular and reproductive effects of P4 and synthetic progestins in fish, and effects of the antiprogestin mifepristone (RU486, an abortive) are unknown. We aimed at elucidating effects on the hormone system by quantitative determination of transcriptional changes of target genes induced by 2, 20, and 200 ng/L P4, RU486, norethindrone (NET), and levonorgestrel (LNG). We exposed zebrafish embryos for 144 h post fertilization (hpf) to these compounds and analyzed expressional changes of ar, esr1, vtg1, hsd17 beta 3, and progesterone (pgr), mineralo- (mr), and glucocorticoid (gr) receptors, each at 48, 96, and 144 hpf Concentrations of NET and LNG were constant during exposure, while P4 and RU486 decreased. P4 and RU486 were the most potent steroids. Significant up to 4-fold induction of pgr, ar, mr, and hsd17b3 occurred at 2 ng/L P4 and higher, while RU484 inhibited pgr expression. NET and LNG modulated some transcripts mainly above 2 ng/L. The expressional chances occurring at environmental levels may translate to negative interference with differentiation of brain and gonads, and consequently reproduction.

AB Implementing advanced wastewater treatment (WWT) to eliminate organic micropollutants (OMPs) is a necessary step to protect vulnerable freshwater ecosystems and water resources. To this end, sorption of OMP by activated carbon (AC) is one viable technology among others. However, conventional AC production based on fossil precursor materials causes environmental pollution, including considerable emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study, we produced activated biochar (AB) from wood and woody residues by physical activation and evaluated their capability to eliminate OMPs in treated wastewater. Activated biochar produced under optimized conditions sorbed 15 model OMPs, of which most were dissociated at circumneutral pH, to the same or higher extent than commercial AC used as a reference. While wood quality played a minor role, the dosage of the activation agent was themain parameter controlling the capacity of ABs to eliminate OMP. Our results highlight the possibility for local production of AB from local wood or woody residues as a strategy to improveWWT avoiding negative side effects of conventional AC production.

AB The environmental loads of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in Beijing were estimated from direct discharge of untreated wastewater and WWTP treated effluent. The annual environmental loads of 15 PPCP components ranged from 16.3 kg (propranolol) to 9.85 tons (caffeine). A fugacity model was developed to successfully estimate the PPCP pollution based on the estimated environmental load. The modeled results approximated the observed PPCP concentrations in Beijing. The untreated wastewater contributed significantly to PPCP pollution in Beijing, ranging from 46% (propranolol) to 99% (caffeine). The total environmental burden of target PPCPs ranged from 0.90 kg (propranolol) to 536 kg (caffeine). Water is the most important media for the fate of PPCPs. Monte Carlo-based concentration distributions of PPCPs are consistent with the observed results. The most important way to reduce the PPCP pollution is to both improve wastewater collection rate and adopt deep treatment technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation of three different synthetic pharmaceutical formulation wastewater containing two human antibiotics and a veterinary antibiotic has been studied to enhance the their biodegradability. The effects of pH and initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) value as well as addition of hydrogen peroxide on ozonation process were investigated. Total organic carbon (TOC), COD, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and aromatic content (UV254) were the parameters followed to evaluate the performance of ozonation process. Comparison of the biodegradability of selected wastewaters containing different antibiotics confirmed that the variation of biodegradability was associated with the target compound. While BOD5/COD ratio of veterinary antibiotic formulation wastewater was increased from 0.077 to 0.38 with an applied ozone dosage of 2.96 g/l, this ratio for human antibiotic I and human antibiotic II was increased from 0 to 0.1 and 0.27 respectively. Moreover the results of this investigation showed that the ozonation process is capable of achieving high levels of COD and aromaticity removals at about their natural pH values.

AB Augmentation of potable water sources by planned indirect potable reuse of wastewater is being widely considered to address growing water shortages. Environmental buffers such as lakes and dams may act as one of a series of barriers to potable water contamination stemming from micropollutants in wastewater. In South-East Queensland, Australia, current government policy is to begin indirect potable reuse of water from reverse osmosis equipped advanced water treatment plants (AWTPs) when the combined capacity of its major storages is at 40% capacity. A total of 15 organic contaminants including NDMA and bisphenol A have been publically reported as detected in recycled water from one of South-East Queensland's AWTPs, while another 98 chemicals were analysed for, but found to be below their detection limit. To assess the natural attenuation in Lake Wivenhoe, a Level III fugacity based evaluative fate model was constructed using the maximum concentrations of these contaminants detected as input data. A parallel aquivalence based model was constructed for those contaminants, such as dichloroacetic acid, dalapon and triclopyr, which are ionised in the environment of Lake Wivenhoe. A total of 247 organic chemicals of interest, including disinfection by-products, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, xenoestrogens and industrial chemicals, were evaluated with the model to assess their potential for natural attenuation. Out of the 15 detected chemicals, trihalomethanes are expected to volatilise with concentrations in the outflow from the dam approximately 400 times lower than influent from the AWTPs. Transformation processes in water are likely to be more significant for NDMA and pharmaceuticals such as salicylic acid and paracetamol as well as for caffeine and the herbicides dalapon and triclopyr. For hydrophobic contaminants such as cholesterol and phenolic xenoestrogens such as 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol and bisphenol A, equilibrium between water and sediments will not be attained and hence fate processes such as removal in outflow are predicted to become relatively important.

AB Due to the potential ecological and human health risks, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are considered as contaminants of emerging concern. PPCPs can be discharged to the aquatic environment from various sources, including municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), animal feeding operations, hospitals, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. A major challenge to regional characterization of ecological and human health risks is identification of the environmental emissions of PPCPs. This study established a facile approach for calculation of PPCP emission factors from raw wastewater and wastewater effluent. Using reported concentrations from WWTPs, nine PPCPs, namely carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, were identified as priority contaminants based on environmental significance (i.e., high detection frequency and potential ecological risk) and data availability. Emission factors were calculated for the nine PPCPs in raw wastewater, secondary effluent, and tertiary effluent for low, medium and high emission scenarios according to the concentration distributions of these nine PPCPs. The emission factors were used to estimate the mass of the PPCPs discharged from the nine provinces and two municipalities of the Yangtze River valley. The total mass of the nine PPCPs emitted into the watershed was estimated as 3867 kg, 8808 kg and 21,464 kg for low, medium and high emission scenarios respectively in 2018. Although uncertainty is inevitable in the emission factors, the reported approach provides a viable alternative to top-down and multimedia fugacity estimation strategies that require an abundance of sewershed-, WWTP-, and compound-specific information that is difficult to collect in developing countries.

AB Pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in the aquatic environment, and have potentially damaging effects. Effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are major sources of these substances. The use of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) STPs, involving cycling between aerobic and anoxic conditions to promote nitrification and denitrification, is increasing but these have yet to be understood in terms of removal of pharmaceutical residues. This study reports on the development of a laboratory rig to simulate a SBR. The rig was used to investigate the fate of radiolabelled propranolol. This is a commonly prescribed beta blocker, but with unresolved fate in STPs.
   The SBR rig (4.5 L) was operated on an 8 h batch cycle with settled sewage. Effective treatment was demonstrated, with clearly distinct treatment phases and evidence of nitrogen removal. Radiolabelled C-14-propranolol was dosed into both single (closed) and continuous (flow-through) simulations over 13 SBR cycles. Radioactivity in CO2 off-gas, biomass and liquid was monitored, along with the characteristics of the sewage. This allowed apparent rate constants and coefficients for biodegradation and solid:water partitioning to be determined.
   Extrapolation from off-gas radioactivity measurements in the single dose 4-d study suggested that propranolol fell outside the definitions of being readily biodegradable (DegT50 = 9.1 d; 60% biodegradation at 12.0 d). During continuous dosing, 63-72% of propranolol was removed in the rig, but less than 4% of dose recovered as (CO2)-C-14, suggesting that biodegradation was a minor process (K-biol(M) L kg d(-1) = 22 49) and that adsorption onto solids dominated, giving rise to accumulations within biomass during the 17 d solid retention time in the SBR. Estimations of adsorption isotherm coefficients were different depending on which of three generally accepted denominators representing sorption sites was used (mixed liquor suspended solids, reactor COD or mass of waste activated sludge).
   With further development and evaluation, the rig developed for simulating SBR processes has potential to be used for informing better environmental risk assessments for those pharmaceuticals showing ambiguous results in field fate studies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Environmentally sustainable solutions for wastewater management including the improvement of water quality and water recycling are considered key priority areas globally. The challenges facing our water resources are unprecedented due to the presence of organic and inorganic pollutants derived from numerous anthropogenic activities. This situation has been further complicated by emerging persistent contaminants such as pharmaceuticals which possess low biodegradability and resistance to chemical and biological treatments. Excretion of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites via human waste, improper disposal and veterinary applications is recognized as the principal sources of pharmaceuticals ending up in various compartments of the environment. Heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) has proven to be a promising treatment method for the degradation of pharmaceuticals.
   Here, we review recent research concerning the application of TiO2 photocatalysis for the removal of selected pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic drug classes. These classes of pharmaceuticals were chosen based on their environmental prevalence and potential adverse effects. The highlighted conclusions from this review are that (1) TiO2 photocatalysis may play a major role in the degradation of pharmaceuticals; (2) various factors such as catalyst loading, initial concentrations, and water matrices significantly influence both the degradation rate and kinetics of degradation; (3) mineralization remains incomplete, despite complete abatement of the parent pharmaceutical due to the formation of stable by-products; (4) structures or number of intermediates formed differ due to the variation of photocatalytic experimental parameters, and (5) laboratory-scale experiments with artificial pharmaceutical solutions, in particular single compounds, are more common than pilot-scale or real wastewater samples. The main conclusion is that the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis can be considered a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Further studies are needed to optimize the operating conditions for maximum degradation of wastewater containing multiple pharmaceuticals under realistic conditions and on industrial scales.

AB A reliable wastewater characterization is an integral part of treatment and management strategies for industrial effluents. This is especially true for the pharmaceutical industry, which exhibits significant differences in its line of activity, generating effluents of very specific and complex natures. Any hazard or risk assessment of wastewater and/or determination of its treatability must include an evaluation of its degradability. Usually various non-standardized laboratory or pilot-scale long-term tests are run by measuring summary parameters for several days to determine the biodegradation potential of the effluent. A complex approach, based on stabilization studies, was proposed to determine the hazardous impact of wastewaters in terms of biodegradable and persistent toxicity.
   The objective of our work was to carry out complex hazard evaluation of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Whole effluent toxicity was determined using two different toxicity tests. First we measured the inhibition of, oxygen consumption by activated sludge. The test indicated toxicity of the wastewater and thus we performed an additional acute toxicity test with luminescent bacteria Vibrio fisheri. The next step was the determination of whole effluent ready biodegradability. It was determined with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption (ISO 9804) and carbon dioxide production (ISO 9439); in a closed respirometer, accompanied by DOC/IC measurements. The pharmaceutical wastewater degraded readily (83%, lag phase was 2 days, biodegradation rate was 0.339 day(-1)) on the basis of O-2 measurements. The biodegradation,calculated from the CO2 measurements, was comparable. We also applied mass balances of DOC/IC at the beginning and at the end of biodegradation experiments to confirm the extent and rate of biodegradation. The determination of hazardous impact and treatability of the effluent was concluded: with aerobic stabilization studies. Biodegradation of the wastewater during the study was followed by relevant biochemical analysis and DOC/IC mass balance.

AB Artificial sweeteners are ubiquitous constituents of sanitary wastewater and are not completely attenuated by wastewater treatment processes. Consequently, artificial sweeteners are increasingly employed as a tool to detect wastewater and help evaluate its impact on aquatic environments. In rural areas, septic systems are known point sources of artificial sweeteners to groundwater, however the potential contribution of artificial sweeteners to streams via this pathway is unknown. We analyzed 294 samples from 173 stream sites in Southern Ontario, Canada, for acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose, and found that 91% had one or more of these compounds present. The stream sites sampled did not have municipal wastewater treatment plants upstream and therefore septic system effluent was the most likely source of the artificial sweeteners. Acesulfame, which is the most recalcitrant of the four artificial sweeteners, was by far the most ubiquitous in streams, with a 91% detection frequency, compared to 27, 8, and 3% for saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose, respectively. Stream concentrations ranged from non-detectable to maximum values of 225, 380, 204, and 291 ng/L for acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose, respectively. We calculated that water from septic effluent contributed from < 0.005% to 0.5% of streamflow, with a median value of 0.052%. This is the first study to use artificial sweetener concentrations to quantify the fraction of septic effluent reaching streams via groundwater flow. Using acesulfame concentrations, we calculated that approximately 13% of the septic effluent water generated in rural Southern Ontario eventually ends up in local streams, however this is likely a conservative estimate. Although much of the septic effluent water that reaches streams may be free of all but the most persistent anthropogenic compounds, our study demonstrates that domestic wastewater must be considered as a possible source of stream contaminants, even if municipal wastewater is not a factor in the watershed.

AB An immobilized photoactive TiO2 coating grown directly on titanium meshes was successfully exploited for the electrochemical photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in real secondary wastewater effluent. The catalyst was prepared by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation and during the photocatalytic water treatment an electrical polarization (bias) was applied to the catalyst. The investigated process was compared with the conventional one employing suspended TiO2 powder (Degussa P25). Results showed that carbamazepine degradation rate follows the order UV/supported TiO2+bias approximate to UV/TiO2 Degussa P25 > UV/supported TiO2 > UV. The investigation also included the identification of other micropollutants and degradation products. This allowed the detection of 201 compounds present in the secondary wastewater effluent employed for the photocatalysis tests, 51 of them also successfully associated to compounds of emerging concern (CECs), and 194 to transformation products (TPs). The degradation of detected compounds followed first-order kinetics and the mean kinetic constant values of the 51 CECs resulted to be 0.048, 0.035 and 0.043 min(-1) for the TiO2+Bias + UV, TiO2+UV and UV, respectively. As for TPs, results showed that the TiO2+Bias + UV treatment is much more efficient than both TiO2+UV and UV in minimizing the intensity of the organics in the real wastewater. Such a better performance was more pronounced at higher reaction time reaching 60% reduction of mean peak area of TPs at 90 min of reaction. Among the detected TPs also compounds belonging to known carbamazepine TPs were found. This allowed to propose a degradation pathway of carbamazepine. The supported catalyst was positively tested for 15 cycles demonstrating that it has the potential to be used in real wastewater tertiary steps aimed at removing CECs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clindamycin is widely prescribed for its ability to treat a number of common bacterial infections. Thus, clindamycin enters wastewater via human excretion or disposal of unused medication and widespread detection of pharmaceuticals in rivers proves the insufficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants in removing clindamycin. Recently, it has been discovered that attached biofilm reactors, e.g., moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) obtain a higher removal of pharmaceuticals than conventional sludge wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, this study investigated the capability of MBBRs applied in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove clindamycin. First, a batch experiment was executed with a high initial concentration of clindamycin to identify the transformation products. It was shown that clindamycin can be removed from wastewater by MBBR and the treatment process converts clindamycin into the, possibly persistent, products clindamycin sulfoxide and N-des methyl clindamycin as well as 3 other mono-oxygenated products.
   Subsequently, the removal kinetics of clindamycin and the formation of the two identified products were investigated in batch experiments using MBBR carriers from polishing and nitrifying reactors. Additionally, the presence of these two metabolites in biofilm-free wastewater effluent was studied. The nitrifying biofilm reactor had a higher biological activity with k-value of 0.1813 h-1 than the reactor with polishing biofilm (k = 0.0161 h-1) which again has a much higher biological activity for removal of clindamycin than of the suspended bacteria (biofilm-free control). Clindamycin sulfoxide was the main transformation product which was found in concentrations exceeding 10% of the initial clindamycin concentration after 1 day of MBBR treatment. Thus, MBBRs should not necessarily be considered as reactors mineralizing clindamycin as they perform transformation reactions at least to some extent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is widely demonstrated that antibiotics in the environment affect microbial community structure. However, direct evidence regarding the impacts of antibiotics on microbial functional structures in wastewater treatment systems is limited. Herein, a high-throughput functional gene array (GeoChip 3.0) in combination with quantitative PCR and clone libraries were used to evaluate the microbial functional structures in two biological wastewater treatment systems, which treat antibiotic production wastewater mainly containing oxytetracycline. Despite the bacteriostatic effects of antibiotics, the GeoChip detected almost all key functional gene categories, including carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, etc., suggesting that these microbial communities were functionally diverse. Totally 749 carbon-degrading genes belonging to 40 groups (24 from bacteria and 16 from fungi) were detected. The abundance of several fungal carbon-degrading genes (e.g., glyoxal oxidase ( glx), lignin peroxidase or ligninase (lip), manganese peroxidase (mnp), endochitinase, exoglucanase_genes) was significantly correlated with antibiotic concentrations (Mantel teSt; P < 0.05), showing that the fungal functional genes have been enhanced by the presence of antibiotics. However, from the fact that the majority of carbon-degrading genes were derived from bacteria and diverse antibiotic resistance genes were detected in bacteria, it was assumed that many bacteria could survive in the environment by acquiring antibiotic resistance and may have maintained the position as a main player in nutrient removal. Variance partitioning analysis showed that antibiotics could explain 24.4% of variations in microbial functional structure of the treatment systems. This study provides insights into the impacts of antibiotics on microbial functional structure of a unique system receiving antibiotic production wastewater, and reveals the potential importance of the cooperation between fungi and bacteria with antibiotic resistance in maintaining the stability and performance of the systems.

AB In this study, pharmaceutical wastewater with high total dissolved solids (TDSs) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) content was treated through a sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment process. For the anaerobic process, an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) was applied, and a COD removal efficiency of 41.3 +/- 2.2% was achieved with an organic loading rate of 8.11 +/- 0.31 g COD/L/d and a hydraulic retention time of 48 h. To evaluate the salinity effect on the anaerobic process, salts in the wastewater were removed by ion exchange resin, and adverse effect of salinity was observed with a TDS concentration above 14.92 g/L. To improve the anaerobic effluent quality, the UASB effluent was further treated by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Both the UASB + MBR and UASB + SBR systems achieved excellent organic removal efficiency, with respective COD removal of 94.7% and 91.8%. The UASB + MBR system showed better performance in both organic removal and nitrification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deep well injection is widely used in South Florida, USA for wastewater disposal largely because of the presence of an injection zone ("boulder zone" of Floridan Aquifer System) that is capable of accepting very large quantities of fluids, in some wells over 75,000m(3)/ day. The greatest potential risk to public health associated with deep injection wells in South Florida is vertical migration of wastewater, containing pathogenic microorganisms and pollutants, into brackish-water aquifer zones that are being used for alternative water-supply projects such as aquifer storage and recovery. Upwards migration of municipal wastewater has occurred in a minority of South Florida injection systems. The results of solute-transport modeling using the SEAWAT program indicate that the measured vertical hydraulic conductivities of the rock matrix would allow for only minimal vertical migration. Fracturing at some sites increased the equivalent average vertical hydraulic conductivity of confining zone strata by approximately four orders of magnitude and allowed for vertical migration rates of up 80m/year. Even where vertical migration was rapid, the documented transit times are likely long enough for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms.

AB This paper aims to examine the multiresidue enantiomeric profiling of (fluoro)quinolones and their metabolites in solid and liquid environmental matrices using chiral HPLC-MS/MS method and a CHIR-ALCEL (R) OZ-RH column. Simultaneous chiral separation was obtained for chiral ofloxacin and its main metabolites ofloxacin-N-oxide and desmethyl-ofioxacin; moxifloxacin; the prodrug prulifloxacin and its active compound ulifloxacin; flumequine; nadifloxacin and R-(+)-besifloxacin. Achiral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid) were also included in the method to enable the analysis of all targeted quinolones within one analytical run. Satisfactory enantiomeric resolution (Rs >= 1) was obtained for five out of eight chiral drugs enabling quantitative analysis. The overall performance of the method was satisfactory with a method precision <20%, relative recoveries >70% for most of the analytes and method detection limits (MDL) at low ng L-1 levels (0.1 < MDL (ng L-1)< 6.4, 0.1 < MDL (ng L-1)< 6.6 and 0.1 <MDL (ng L-1)< 7.0 in influent, effluent and river waters for 83% compounds, 0.01 <MDL (ng g(-t))< 4.9 in solids for 91% compounds). Enantiomeric profiling from a week-long monitoring campaign in the UK showed that (+/-)-ofloxacin was found to be racemic in upstream waters but it was enriched with S-(-)-enantiomer in wastewater and in receiving waters. This could be due to the fact that ofloxacin can be used both as a racemate and as a S-(-)-enantiomer. Its consumption was further confirmed by the chiral signature of the investigated ofloxacin metabolites. As a result, alterations in the enantiomeric composition of antibiotics could influence not only their activity and toxicity in the environment, but also could induce changes in the microbial communities constantly exposed to them.

AB Sediments from a rural to urban gradient along the Alafia River in Florida, USA, were collected to determine the risk of environmental contamination with legacy (organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)) and new contaminants (pharmaceuticals).
   Bed sediments (0-10 cm) collected from rural and urban sub-basins of the Alafia River were analyzed for OCPs and pharmaceuticals using standard gas chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques.
   Three most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in sediments were carbamazepine (100 % of samples), trimethoprim (89 % of samples), and pseudoephedrine (63 % of samples). While acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, lidocaine, and nicotine were detected in < 30 % of samples. The detection of caffeine in all sediment samples suggests that domestic wastewater from wastewater treatment plants and/or septic systems may be a contributing source at all the sites. Among the OCPs, endosulfan I was most frequently detected (37 % of samples), followed by delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (15 % of samples), gamma-chlordane and endosulfan II (both in 11 % of samples), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and methoxychlor (both in 7 % of samples). The lower concentrations of OCPs (sum 0-16.1 ng g(-1)) than pharmaceuticals (sum 0.5-61.9 ng g(-1)) in sediments are probably due to the historic use of OCPs since these were banned for use in the USA in the 1970s, while pharmaceuticals are still used.
   The variability in detection and concentrations of legacy and new compounds in rural and urban stream sediments is likely due to the different magnitude of input sources, site characteristics, and chemical properties of individual compounds. Significant positive correlations between OCPs and sediment properties (organic matter, silt, and clay) suggest that sediments are a major sink of various contaminants in the Alafia River. We conclude that the concentrations of both pharmaceuticals and OCPs in sediments of this urban river are relatively lower than existing literature; however, these can still be of environmental concern to aquatic organisms.

AB Large quantities of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are susceptible of entering the terrestrial environments through the application of recycled wastewater, manures, and biosolids, resulting in their progressive contamination and possible long-term effects over terrestrial species. Many studies on the environmental fate of CECs focus on aquatic environments and/or wastewater treatment plants, but little is still known about their behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations in agricultural soils. In this study, we evaluated the adsorption and degradation of nine different pharmaceuticals (nadolol, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethopyridazone, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, diclofenac, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil) and four artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate, and sucralose) in two soils under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The sorption of target compounds in soils fitted well to a Freundlich isotherm model and was relatively low (K-f < 200 L kg(-1)) Sorption was highest for cyclamate (K-f = 162 L kg(-1)) and acesulfame (K-f = 156 L kg(-1)), while lowest sorption coefficients were measured for ibuprofen (K-f = 1-7 L kg(-1)) All target compounds (except for carbamazepine) were susceptible to microbial degradation under aerobic conditions, with half-lives ranging from 1 to 18 days. Degradation occurred at a higher rate under aerobic conditions for most contaminants, but they were relatively persistent under anaerobic conditions. For instance, over 90% of the initial amount of spiked nadolol was degraded in aerobic soils after 4 days of incubation, while only 18-24% was lost in absence of oxygen after 1 month, resulting in t(1/2) values between 95 and 103 days. The degradation behavior of the target compounds varied in relation to soil and compound physicochemical properties as well as the microbial activities (e.g., 220 ppm of CH4 were produced in anaerobic experiments) and aeration of the tested soils. Overall, the poor adsorption and relative persistence of sucralose and carbamazepine suggests that both may be used as potential tracers for soil and groundwater contamination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of the research presented in this paper was twofold: (1) to demonstrate the coupling of two state-of-the-art techniques: a time-weighted polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and microliquid chromatography-electrospray/ion-trap mass spectrometry and (2) to assess the ability of these methodologies to detect six drugs (azithromycin, fluoxetine, omeprazole, levothyroxine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) in a real-world environment, e.g., waste water effluent. In the effluent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), azithromycin was detected at concentrations ranging from 15 to 66 ng/L, which is equivalent to a total annual release of 1 to 4 kg into receiving waters. Detected and confirmed in the effluent from two WWTPs were two illicit drugs, methamphetamine and MDMA, at 2 and 0.5 ng/L, respectively. Although the ecotoxicologic significance of drugs in environmental matrices, particularly water, has not been closely examined, it can only be surmised that these substances have the potential to adversely affect biota that are continuously exposed to them even at very low levels. The potential for chronic effects on human health is also unknown but of increasing concern because of the multiuse character of water, particularly in densely populated, arid areas.

AB DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is one of the most frequently detected trace organic contaminants (TOrC) in wastewaters and is used primarily as an insect repellent. It was introduced for use in the general public in 1957. It is ubiquitously present in the environment and DEET concentrations are usually among the highest reported for TOrCs. Due to recent concerns about possible analytical interferences in detection methods being reported, this study focused on possible artifacts caused by seasonal, spatial, and diurnal variations in wastewater influent concentration of DEET. We also compared usage data to observed wastewater concentrations of seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in four different regions in the US monitored from November 2014 to November 2016. Consumption data obtained reveal patterns of consumption according to climatic regions and season. During the summer DEET usage accounts for almost 60% of all usage during a year, while during the winter months DEET usage accounts for< 5%. Concerning spatial distribution, while per capita consumption of DEET in Florida is three times higher than the one observed in Arizona (44 g vs 14 g), DEET concentrations in wastewater tend to be much higher in Arizona. Regardless of WWTPs or monitoring period, concentrations as high as 15,200 ng/L were observed during the month of October 2016. While DEET has a diurnal variation in the wastewater influent, with a maximum at 18:00, the diurnal variability is not enough to explain the great discrepancies between consumption of DEET versus occurrence in wastewaters. Although LC-MS/MS analysis of isobaric and structural mimics suggests some possibility of interferences, NMR spectroscopy analysis of environmental samples does not support the presence of such mimics in real samples.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination of contiguous groundwater is a substantial concern in wastewater-impacted streams, due to ubiquity in effluent, high aqueous mobility, designed bioactivity, and to effluent-driven hydraulic gradients. Wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) closures are rare environmental remediation events; offering unique insights into contaminant persistence, long-term wastewater impacts, and ecosystem recovery processes. The USGS conducted a combined pre/post-closure groundwater assessment adjacent to an effluent-impacted reach of Fourmile Creek, Ankeny, Iowa, USA. Higher surface-water concentrations, consistent surface-water to groundwater concentration gradients, and sustained groundwater detections tens of meters from the stream bank demonstrated the importance of WWTF effluent as the source of groundwater pharmaceuticals as well as the persistence of these contaminants under effluent-driven, pre-closure conditions. The number of analytes (110 total) detected in surface water decreased from 69 prior to closure down to 8 in the first post-closure sampling event approximately 30 d later, with a corresponding 2 order of magnitude decrease in the cumulative concentration of detected analytes. Post-closure cumulative concentrations of detected analytes were approximately 5 times higher in proximal groundwater than in surface water. About 40% of the 21 contaminants detected in a downstream groundwater transect immediately before WWTF closure exhibited rapid attenuation with estimated half-lives on the order of a few days; however, a comparable number exhibited no consistent attenuation during the year-long post-closure assessment. The results demonstrate the potential for effluent-impacted shallow groundwater systems to accumulate pharmaceutical contaminants and serve as long-term residual sources, further increasing the risk of adverse ecological effects in groundwater and the near-stream ecosystem.

AB In this study, the occurrence in wastewater of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), naproxen and ibuprofen, and one personal care product, triclosan, was assessed using the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS). The samplers were initially calibrated in the laboratory to obtain sampling rates (R-s) for each target compound followed by deployment in the influent and effluent of Goudkoppies and Northern Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs), South Africa. Exposure was done for 14 days in 2012. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence (FLD) detectors was used to analyse POCIS extracts. Laboratory calibration of POCIS yielded R-s values for the three compounds that were between 0.087 and 0.383 l.d(-1) in quiescent conditions, and 0.125 and 0.936 l.d(-1) in stirred conditions. From the accumulated amounts in field-deployed samplers, estimated freely dissolved concentrations of the studied compounds in wastewater influent ranged from 55.0 to 78.4 mu g.l(-1) and 52.3 to 127.7 mu g.l(-1) in Goudkoppies and Northern WWTPs, respectively. Average concentrations of these compounds in the treated effluent ranged from 10.7 to 13.5 mu g.l(-1) in Goudkoppies WWTP, and 20.4 to 24.6 mu g.l(-1) in Northern WWTP. Analyte removal efficiencies varied between 68 and 86% in Goudkoppies WWTP and 61 and 82% in Northern WWTP. Grab samples processed by SPE method yielded higher analyte concentrations (up to three-fold) as compared to POCIS-derived estimates. This discrepancy was attributed to SPE's ability to extract both the free dissolved, and particle sorbed fractions of the contaminants.

AB Pharmaceutical contamination in the aquatic environment is a global issue that affects aquatic animals, microorganisms and human health. The occurrence and preliminary ecological risk of 12 (11 antibiotics and 1 antiepileptic drug) pharmaceuticals were investigated for the first time in the surface water of the old Brahmaputra River, where open-water-fed aquaculture activities are being practiced in Bangladesh. The pharmaceuticals were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), operated with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Nine pharmaceuticals were detected in the river surface water, whereas three were below the limit of detection (LOD). Metronidazole was detected in all the samples with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 13.51 ng L-1 Trimethoprim had the second highest frequency of detection (95%) with the highest concentration (17.20 ng L-1). The ranges of concentration and detection frequency of sulfonamides and macrolides were < LOD-11.35 and < LOD-16.68 ng L-1 ; 35-70 and 60-85%, respectively, whereas carbamazepine was in the range of < LOD-8.80 ng L-1 and had a detection frequency of 65%. The concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin were distinctly higher in the fed aquaculture areas. The principal component analysis confirmed that fed aquaculture activities contributed most of the pharmaceutical contamination in the river surface water. Hospitals, nursing homes, sewage wastewater or surface runoff from the surrounding areas might all contribute to the presence of metronidazole and carbamazepine. The preliminary ecological risk assessment revealed that sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin showed medium risk, and carbamazepine displayed low risk to sensitive aquatic organisms for maximum measured concentrations. Thus, this study suggests that pharmaceutical contamination in different rivers and seasons needs to be quantified, and ecological as well as human health risks need to be assessed in Bangladesh.

AB An environmental risk assessment of eleven pharmaceuticals according to the guideline recommended by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) was performed. Cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, cyclophosphamide, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen. metoprolol, paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and trimethoprim were selected for assessment by the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated according to both the EMEA guideline and a conventional model for comparison and ranged from 0.0002 to 45 mu g/L. Available acute and chronic toxicity data were collected from the literature, although no data were available for cyclophosphamide. Toxicity tests showed cyclophosphamide to have relatively low acute toxicity with an EC50 for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata > 100 mg/L and a Daphnia magna reproduction NOEC of 56 mg/L. These and the literature data were used to derive predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC). Risk quotients (PEC/PNEC) were then calculated for all I I pharmaceutical compounds. Risk quotients greater than I were obtained for ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ethinylestradiol, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline according to the EMEA guideline. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs) confirmed that the release of ciprofloxacin from wastewater treatment works may potentially be of environmental concerti in Norway. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Six trace contaminants (acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), carbamazepine (CBZ), diatrizoic acid (DTA), 1H-benzotriazole (BTZ) and its 4-methyl analogue (4-TTri)) were traced from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to receiving waters and further to riverbank filtration (RBF) wells to evaluate their prediction power as potential wastewater markers. Furthermore, the persistence of some compounds was investigated in advanced wastewater treatment by soil aquifer treatment (SAT). During wastewater treatment in four conventional activated sludge WWTPs ACE, SUC, and CBZ showed a pronounced stability expressed by stable concentration ratios in influent (in) and effluent (out) (ACE/CBZ: in45, out40; SUC/CBZ: in1.8, out1.7; and ACE/SUC: in24, out24). In a fifth WWTP, additional treatment with powdered activated carbon led to a strong elimination of CBZ, BTZ, and 4-TTri of about 80% and consequently to a distinctive shift of their ratios with unaffected compounds. Data from a seven month monitoring program at seven sampling locations at the rivers Rhine and Main in Germany revealed the best concentration correlation for ACE and CBZ (r(2) = 0.94) and also a good correlation of ACE and CBZ concentrations to BTZ and 4-TTri levels (r(2) = 0.66 to 0.82). The comparison of ratios at different sampling sites allowed for the identification of a CBZ point source. Furthermore, in Switzerland a higher consumption of SUC compared to Germany can be assumed, as a steadily increasing ACE/SUC ratio along the river Rhine was observed. In RBF wells a good correlation (r(2) = 0.85) was again observed for ACE and CBZ. Both also showed the highest stability at a prolonged residence time in the subsurface of a SAT field. In the most peripheral wells ACE and CBZ were still detected with mean values higher than 36 mu g L-1 and 1.3 mu g L-1, respectively. Although SUC concentrations in wastewater used for SAT decreased by more than 80% from about 18 mu g L-1 to 2.1 mu gL(-1) and 3.5 mu g L-1 in these outlying wells, the compound was still adequate to indicate a wastewater impact in a qualitative way.

   methodology; Membranes; Characterization
AB The pollution of hydric sources by pharmaceuticals is an issue in many countries, particularly in Brazil. The presence of these substances causes deleterious effects on the environment and human health. One of the main sources of this contamination is domestic sewage, due to the expressive amount of medicines released in their unaltered form. Unfortunately, traditional wastewater treatment is not effective for the removal of pharmaceuticals and, for this reason, membrane technology is an attractive alternative to overcome this issue. In this regard, hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), are the most suitable. However, their high affinity with water causes intense swelling, leading to severe modifications in the membrane properties. In view of all these facts, the present work evaluated the swelling of PVA-based membranes, with the aim of finding the membrane preparation method that has the lowest swelling, thereby providing the most suitable characteristics for pharmaceutical removal from wastewater. The membranes were prepared by the casting of a polymeric solution, with PVA as a basis polymer, citric acid as a crosslink agent and glycerol and silver nanoparticles as performance additives. The process optimization was performed using a design of experiments with posterior analysis by the response surface methodology (RSM). The RSM assessed the effect on the membrane swelling of the factors, including citric acid concentration and the time and temperature of crosslinking. The membrane characterization was performed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with a field emission gun (SEM-FEG) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. Overall, the condition that showed the lowest swelling was obtained with 10% of citric acid and crosslinking for 4 h at 130 degrees C. Under these conditions, the membrane had a mass swelling of 42% and a dimensional swelling of 24%. Additionally, the statistical analysis revealed that the factors with the dominant effects were the citric acid concentration and the temperature of crosslinking. The FT-IR analysis suggested that the crosslinking occurred by an esterification reaction, as showed by the stretching frequencies of C=O at 1710 cm(-1) and ester C-O at 1230 cm(-1). Moreover, the SEM-FEG images revealed a smooth and flat surface and a dense cross section with a thickness of similar to 113 mu m. Concerning the WCA, the angle was at similar to 80 degrees, which is characteristic of hydrophilic materials. Finally, the data suggested that it is possible to optimize the membrane preparation process with adequate properties so that it can be subsequently applied to the removal of pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater.

AB The use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is rapidly increasing to respond to the ever-growing demands for water and food resources. However, this practice may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in agricultural settings. To evaluate this potential risk, we analyzed microbiomes and resistomes of soil and Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) root samples from pots irrigated with tap water spiked with 0, 20, or 100 mu g L-1 of a mixture of three antibiotics (Trimethoprim, Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole). The presence of antibiotics induced changes in bacterial populations, particularly in soil, as revealed by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Parallel shotgun sequencing identified a total of 56 different ARGs conferring resistance against 14 antibiotic families. Antibiotic-treated samples showed increased loads of ARGs implicated in mutidrug resistance or in both direct and indirect acquired resistance. These changes correlated with the prevalence of Xantomonadales species in the root microbiomes. We interpret these data as indicating different strategies of soil and root microbiomes to cope with the presence of antibiotics, and as a warning that their presence may increase the loads of ARBs and ARGs in edible plant parts, therefore constituting a potential risk for human consumers.

AB This work deals with the biodegradability and toxicity of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) treated by ozonation. The results show that the total removal of 200 mg L-1 of diclofenac and 100 mg L-1 of naproxen is possible using an ozone dose of 0.20 and 0.04 g L-1, respectively. For 200 mg L-1 of ibuprofen, 90% removal is achieved using an ozone dose of 2.3 g L-1. The BOD5/COD ratio, the Zahn-Wallens test and EC50 toxicity test (Microtox) are chosen as biological and toxicity indicators of NSAID intermediates. The evolution of BOD5/COD ratio during 1 hour of treatment is evaluated and the results show that ozonation improves the biodegradability for the three NSAID treated solution. The Zahn-Wellens test for diclofenac and ibuprofen solutions shows that biological mineralization, after 28 days, is higher for diclofenac than for ibuprofen solution. According to the Microtox test, the treatment with ozone removes the toxicity of the naproxen solution. Taking into account the results obtained with the biocompatibility tests it could be assumed that ozonation is an adequate treatment for removal NSAID in aquatic medium, and the ozonated effluents could be post-treated in a biological wastewater facility.

AB This work is focused on the study of the role of several conductive-diamond characteristics (boron doping, sp(3)/sp(2) ratio, diamond-layer thickness) on the performance of the electrolysis of enrofloxacin (as model complex-organic pollutant). Commercial lots provided by an important conductive-diamond manufacturing company have been used. Results show that enrofloxacin electrooxidation is strongly influenced by the conductive-diamond characteristics; particularly the ratio diamond/graphite carbon was found one of the most significant parameters in this process: the higher the content in diamond-carbon the greater the TOC and COD decays in the bulk electrolyses. These results have been interpreted in terms of the oxidation mechanism involved. High graphite content favours direct oxidation of the pollutant on the electrode surface and leads to the formation of many intermediates. On contrary, high diamond content seems to favour the complete oxidation of the organic to carbon dioxide, thanks to the contribution of the oxidants (hydroxyl radicals and electrogenerated reagents) present in a region close to the electrode surface. Likewise, the oxidation rate seems to be improved with increase in the concentration of boron and decrease in the thickness of the substrate layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Steam explosion pretreatment was developed and evaluated to remove pharmaceuticals and heavy metals from wastewater sludge and to improve its biodegradability and methane yield. Effects of pressure (5-15 bar) and duration (1-15 min) during the pretreatment were examined, and the pretreatment efficiency was evaluated based on the solubilization degree, the capillary suction time (CST) test and anaerobic digestion. The removal efficiency of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and amoxicillin was 65%, 69%, and 66% and 70%, 66%, and 70% in primary sludge (PS) and waste-activated sludge (WAS), respectively. The highest percent release efficiency of heavy metals, i.e., lead, cadmium, and silver, for PS and WAS was 78%, 70%, and 79% and 79%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. The highest methane yield was obtained after pretreatment at 10 bar for 15 min and at 15 bar for 10 min, with respective yields of 380 and 358 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS) for the PS and 315 and 334 mL CH4/g VS for the WAS. The results of methane production indicated that the decreased concentrations of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals resulted in increased biodegradability of PS and WAS.

AB Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) are widely used pharmaceuticals which have been detected in the environment. Predicting the transport and ultimate fate of beta blockers in the environment requires understanding their adsorption to soils and sediments, something for which little information is currently available. The objective of this work was to examine the adsorption of three beta blockers, propranolol, metoprolol and nadolol, to a natural alluvial material, as well as to six minerals present as components of the alluvial material. Batch adsorption experiments indicate that, for most of the minerals studied, compound hydrophobicity is an important predictor of adsorption, with propranolol, the most hydrophobic compound studied, adsorbing to the greatest extent. Results further suggest that, for the minerals studied, electrostatic effects are not a good predictor of adsorption; adsorption extent was not well-predicted by either surface zeta potential or by the difference between experiment pH and point of zero charge, despite the cationic nature af the three beta blockers at experiment pH values. Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), on adsorption. Results indicate that SDBS significantly increases the adsorption of propranolol to two different sorbents. This result is potentially important because surfactants such as SDBS are likely to be present in wastewater effluents with beta blockers and could influence their mobility in the environment.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic exposure to municipal sewage treatment effluent at environmentally relevant concentrations on immune parameters in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), including the assessment of potential differences in reactivity between sexually mature male and female fish. Trout were exposed to 1.5 and 15% (v/v) secondary treated municipal sewage effluent for 32 weeks. Fish were injected intra-peritoneally either with inactivated Aeromonas salmonicida to simulate an infection or with PBS as control for this immune challenge 6 weeks prior to sampling., Exposure to effluent resulted in a decrease in A. salmonicida-specific serum antibody level and blood lymphocyte numbers in mature females, but not in male fish. Injection of A. salmonicida resulted in enhanced serum lysozyme activity in mature male trout, which were not exposed to effluent. This stimulating effect of A. salmonicida could not be found in effluent-exposed trout, again potentially revealing a suppressive effect of the effluent. An influence of sampling fish on two consecutive days was observed in many immune parameters, most likely reflecting handling stress. Leucocyte and lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood were consistently lower in male and female fish on the second sampling day. Phagocytosis in head kidney macrophages from male trout was also influenced by sampling day, whereby a stimulation of this reaction occurred on the second day of sampling. Liver mixed function oxygenase activity was found to be enhanced in mature male trout exposed to 15% effluent. In conclusion, the study showed, that exposure to sewage treatment plant effluent, in surface water relevant concentrations, can lead to potentially adverse effects on selected immune reactions in rainbow trout. However, this study also demonstrated that both handling stress and the sex of mature fish have distinct influences on the immune response detected in male and female fish and are likely to influence measured immune parameters to the extent that subtle effluent induced changes may be difficult to detect.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are one of the most prescribed pharmaceutical classes worldwide. They have reached the focus as environmental pollutants in the current scientific research, due to their potential risks to aquatic organisms even in the lower ng L-1 range. The objective of this study was to determine the kinetic behavior of selected GCs and to identify their main transformation products (TPs) in lab scaled biodegradation experiments. Therefore, we analyzed the removal of 13 GCs in aerated incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a German municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as inoculum. For all steroids, an exponential decrease of the concentrations was observed, which was modelled by pseudo-first order kinetics. Overall, the rate constants k(biol )ranged from 0.07 L g(ss)(-1) d(-1) (triamcinolone acetonide) to 250 L g(ss)(-1)d(-1) (prednisolone). These results emphasize the broad variation in the biodegradability and recalcitrance of certain GCs. The selection of the studied GCs enabled a deduction of microbiological stability related to functional groups. Based on the identified TPs, a variety of enzymatically mediated reactions were postulated. Moreover, the identified TPs are characterized by an intact steroid core structure. Thus residual endocrine activity cannot be ruled out. The main observed reactions were regioselective hydrogenation of carbon double-bonds, degradation of the steroid C17 side-chain, ester hydrolysis and oxidative hydroxylation. In total, 41 TPs were tentatively identified and 22 of them were unambiguously confirmed via reference standards. Additionally, 12 TPs were detected in the effluents of municipal WWTPs and, to the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of eight of these TPs has been shown for the first time. These TPs might significantly contribute to the detected residual endocrine activities in the aquatic environments. Therefore, there is a strong need for efficient removal strategies, in particular for persistent steroid hormones with elevated potencies. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of most prescribed antibiotic compounds from four therapeutic classes (beta-lactam, cephalosporins, macrolides, fluoroquinolones) were studied at two full-scale WWTPs, two rivers, thirteen groundwater resources, and five water treatment plants in Tehran. Analytical methodology was based on high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. Samples were collected at 33 sample locations on three sampling periods over four months from June to August 2016. None of the target antibiotics were detected in groundwater resources and water treatment plants, while seven out of nine target antibiotics were analyzed in two studied river waters as well as the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants at concentrations ranging from <LOQ to 926.32 ng/L. Ciprofloxacin predominated in all analyzed influent (552.6-796.2 ng/L) and effluent (127-248.7 ng/L) samples of WWTP A, whereas cephalosporins including cephalexin (523.3-977.7 ng/L) and cefixime (278.65 to 422.1 ng/L) were the most abundant detected antibiotics in the influent and effluent of WWTP B. Aqueous phase removal efficiencies were assessed and ranged from 339.83% to 100% for the seven detected antibiotics. "Negative removals" were observed for erythromycin, azithromycin, and cefixime due to the deconjugation of conjugated metabolites via biological transformation in the studied WWTPs. From a statistical point of view, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the concentrations of cefixime, cephalexin, azithromycin, and erythromycin in the effluent of both studied WWTPs. Ciprofloxacin and cephalexin were the most abundant detected antibiotics in the two studied river waters. Statistical results revealed that there were significant differences in the concentrations of ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and erythromycin (p < 0.05) in Firozabad ditch (receiving WWTP effluent) and Kan River (non-receiving WWTP effluent) which demonstrated thatWWTPs discharges could be an important source of antibiotics being released in water bodies.

AB Solid-liquid partitioning is one of the main fate processes determining the removal of micropollutants in wastewater. Little is known on the sorption of micropollutants in biofilms, where molecular diffusion may significantly influence partitioning kinetics. In this study, the diffusion and the sorption of 23 micropollutants were investigated in novel moving bed biofllm reactor (MBBR) carriers with controlled biofllm thickness (50, 200 and 500 gm) using targeted batch experiments (initial concentration = 1 mu g L-1, for X-ray contrast media 15 mu g L-1) and mathematical modelling. We assessed the influence of biofilm thickness and density on the dimensionless effective diffusivity coefficient f (equal to the biofilm-to-aqueous diffusivity ratio) and the distribution coefficient K-d,K-eq (L g(-1)). Sorption was significant only for eight positively charged micropollutants (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, citalopram, venlafaxine, erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin), revealing the importance of electrostatic interactions with solids. Sorption equilibria were likely not reached within the duration of batch experiments (4 h), particularly for the thickest biofllm, requiring the calculation of the distribution coefficient K-d,K-eq based on the approximation of the asymptotic equilibrium concentration (t > 4 h). K-d,K-eq values increased with increasing biofilm thickness for all sorptive micropollutants (except atenolol), possibly due to higher porosity and accessible surface area in the thickest biofilm. Positive correlations between K-d,K-eq and micropollutant properties (polarity and molecular size descriptors) were identified but not for all biofilm thicknesses, thus confirming the challenge of improving predictive sorption models for positively charged compounds. A diffusion-sorption model was developed and calibrated against experimental data, and estimated fvalues also increased with increasing biofllm thickness. This indicates that diffusion in thin biofilms may be strongly limited (f << 0.1) by the high biomass density (reduced porosity). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The research focuses on the monitoring of trace metals and pharmaceuticals as potential anthropogenic indicators of industrial and urban influences on surface water. This study includes analysis of tracers use for the indication of water pollution events and discussion of the detection method of these chemicals. The following criteria were proposed for the evaluation of indicators: specificity (physical chemical properties), variability (spatial and temporal), and practicality (capacity of the sampling and analytical techniques). The combination of grab and passive water sampling (i.e., diffusive gradient in the thin film and polar organic chemical integrated samplers) procedure was applied for the determination of dissolved and labile trace metals (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diazepam, paracetamol, caffeine, diclofenac, and ketoprofen). Samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS; trace metals) and liquid chromatography-tandem MS electrospray ionization+/- (pharmaceuticals). Our results demonstrate the distinctive spatial and temporal patterns of trace elements distribution along an urban watercourse. Accordingly, two general groups of trace metals have been discriminated: "stable" (Cd and Cr) and "time varying" (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb). The relationship Cd a parts per thousand << aEuro parts per thousand Cu > Ag > Cr a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand Zn was proposed as an anthropogenic signature of the industrial and urban activities pressuring the environment from point sources (municipal wastewaters) and the group Pb-Ni was discussed as a relevant fingerprint of the economic activity (industry and transport) mainly from non-point sources (runoff, atmospheric depositions, etc.). Pharmaceuticals with contrasting hydro-chemical properties of molecules (water solubility, bioaccumulation, persistence during wastewater treatment processes) were discriminated on conservative, labile, and with combined properties in order to provide information on wastewater treatment plant efficiency, punctual events (e.g., accidents on sewage works, runoff), and uncontrolled discharges. Applying mass balance modeling, medicaments were described as relevant socio-economic indicators, which can give a picture of main social aspects of the region.

AB There is an increasing focus on research related to the removal of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) from wastewater by using constructed wetlands (CWs). However, research is lacking on translating the available scientific evidence into decision support tools. In this paper, a novel decision tree framework is developed and demonstrated. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) generate a list of EOCs by the analysis of the wastewater; (2) select the best type of CW for each of the selected EOCs; (3) select a final type of CW for the removal of the selected EOCs; (4) identify detailed design and operational features of the proposed CW such as, depth, area, plants, support matrix, hydraulic loading rate, organic loading rate, and hydraulic retention time; and (5) assess the expected removal efficiency of EOCs in the selected CW. A novel decision support tool, named as DTFT-CW, was developed to generate data and information for the application of the proposed decision tree framework. DTFT-CW (given as a supplementary material) was developed using Microsoft Excel 2016 to support decisions on the design, operation, and performance of CWs for the removal of 59 EOCs (33 pharmaceuticals-PhCs, 15 personal care products-PCPs, and 11 steroidal hormones-SHs). The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the developed decision-making tools by considering 19 EOCs (13 PhCs, one PCPs, and five SHs) as an example, which pose high environmental risk and are on the European Union watch list (six of the 19 EOCs). An integrated design of HCW (combining vertical flow CW, horizontal flow CW-HFCW, and freewater surface CW) is recommended for the treatment of multiple EOCs instead of a single type of CW such as HFCW that is most widely used in practice. The proposed tools could be useful for decision makers such as policy makers, design engineers, and researchers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photoreactivity of treated wastewater effluent organic matter differs from that of natural organic matter, and the indirect phototransformation rates of micropollutants originating in wastewater are expected to depend on the fractional contribution of wastewater to total stream flow. Photodegradation rates of four common compounds of wastewater origin (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine, cimetidine and caffeine) were measured in river water, treated municipal wastewater effluent and mixtures of both to simulate various effluent-stream water mixing conditions that could occur in environmental systems. Compounds were chosen for their unique photodegradation pathways with the photochemically produced reactive intermediates, triplet-state excited organic matter ((OM)-O-3*), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot). For all compounds, higher rates of photodegradation were observed in effluent relative to upstream river water. Sulfamethoxazole degraded primarily via direct photolysis, with some contribution from OH center dot and possibly from carbonate radicals and other unidentified reactive intermediates in effluent-containing samples. Sulfadimethoxine also degraded mainly by direct photolysis, and natural organic matter appeared to inhibit this process to a greater extent than predicted by light screening. In the presence of effluent organic matter, sulfadimethoxine showed additional reactions with OH center dot and O-1(2). In all water samples, cimetidine degraded by reaction with O-1(2) (>95%) and caffeine by reaction with OH" (>95%). In river water mixtures, photodegradation rate constants for all compounds increased with increasing fractions of effluent. A conservative mixing model was able to predict reaction rate constants in the case of hydroxyl radical reactions, but it overestimated rate constants in the case of (OM)-O-3* and O-1(2) pathways. Finally, compound degradation rate constants normalized to the rate of light absorption by water correlated with E-2/E-3 ratios (sample absorbance at 254 nm divided by sample absorbance at 365 nm), suggesting that organic matter optical properties may hold promise to predict indirect compound photodegradation rates for various effluent mixing ratios.

AB Characterization and treatment of a real pharmaceutical wastewater containing 775 mg dissolved organic carbon per liter by a solar photo-Fenton/biotreatment were studied. There were also many inorganic compounds present in the matrix. The most important chemical in this wastewater was nalidixic acid (45 mg/L), an antibiotic pertaining to the quinolone group. A Zahn-Wellens test demonstrated that the real bulk organic content of the wastewater was biodegradable, but only after long biomass adaptation; however, the nalidixic acid concentration remained constant, showing that it cannot be biodegraded. An alternative is chemical oxidation (photo-Fenton process) first to enhance biodegradability, followed by a biological treatment (Immobilized Biomass Reactor - IBR). in this case, two studies of photo-Fenton treatment of the real wastewater were performed, one with an excess of H2O2 (kinetic study) and another with controlled H2O2 dosing (biodegradability and toxicity studies). In the kinetic study, nalidixic acid completely disappeared after 190 min. In the other experiment with controlled H2O2, nalidixic acid degradation was complete at 66 mM of H2O2 consumed. Biodegradability and toxicity bioassays showed that photo-Fenton should be performed until total degradation of nalidixic acid before coupling a biological treatment. Analysis of the average oxidation state (AOS) demonstrated the formation of more oxidized intermediates. With this information, the photo-Fenton treatment time (190 min) and H2O2 dose (66 ram) necessary for adequate biodegradability of the wastewater could be determined. An IBR operated in batch mode was able to reduce the remaining DOC to less than 35 mg/L. Ammonium consumption and NO3 generation demonstrated that nitrification was also attained in the IBR. Overall DOC degradation efficiency of the combined photo-Fenton and biological treatment was over 95%, of which 33% correspond to the solar photochemical process and 62% to the biological treatment.

Although biological treatment by conventional and membrane bioreactor failed, the advanced oxidation methods using ozone (O3), O3/UV or hydrogen peroxide in combination with UV (H2O2/UV), successfully achieved their complete elimination. Target compounds could be confirmed as permanently present pollutants in Aachen-Soers wastewater in concentrations between 0.006 and 1.9 g L-1 prior to AOP treatment resulting in a complete elimination.

AB The use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is rapidly increasing to respond to the ever-growing demands for water and food resources. However, this practice may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in agricultural settings. To evaluate this potential risk, we analyzed microbiomes and resistomes of soil and Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) root samples from pots irrigated with tap water spiked with 0, 20, or 100 mu g L-1 of a mixture of three antibiotics (Trimethoprim, Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole). The presence of antibiotics induced changes in bacterial populations, particularly in soil, as revealed by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Parallel shotgun sequencing identified a total of 56 different ARGs conferring resistance against 14 antibiotic families. Antibiotic-treated samples showed increased loads of ARGs implicated in mutidrug resistance or in both direct and indirect acquired resistance. These changes correlated with the prevalence of Xantomonadales species in the root microbiomes. We interpret these data as indicating different strategies of soil and root microbiomes to cope with the presence of antibiotics, and as a warning that their presence may increase the loads of ARBs and ARGs in edible plant parts, therefore constituting a potential risk for human consumers.

AB The removal of hydrophobic organic pollutants in water to surfactant-coated aluminum hydroxide [surfactant-Al(OH)(3)] was investigated. Anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT), and sodium oleate were sorbed on positively charged aluminum hydroxide at pH 7 and formed hydrophobic aggregates that can incorporate hydrophobic organic pollutants in water. Because of the hydrophobic interaction and decrease in the positive charge, surfactant-Al(OH)(3) was coagulated into precipitates that can readily be separated from water. Hydrophobic organic pollutants such as alkylphenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, estrogens, chlorinated antifungals, and pesticides were well collected to the precipitates and thus efficiently removed from water. The collection of hydrophobic organic pollutants was correlated to their aqueous-octanol distribution coefficient. The decomposition of hydrophobic organic pollutants was examined using a bacterial agent (Bacillus subtilis). Hydrophobic organic compounds collected to AOT-Al(OH)(3) or sodium oleate-Al(OH)(3) were insufficiently decomposed. On the other hand, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and pendimethalin collected to SDS-Al(OH)(3) were decomposed within 1 week. The decomposition was accelerated by the collection to SDS-Al(OH)(3).

AB The effect of effluent recirculation on the removal of total nitrogen (TN) and eight pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) was evaluated during 9 months in an experimental hybrid constructed wetland (CW) system applied in the treatment of urban wastewater. An Imhoff tank was followed by three stages of CWs (two 1.5m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF) beds alternating feed-rest cycles, a 2-m(2) horizontal (HF) and a 2-m2 free water surface (FWS) wetland in series). A fraction of the final effluent was recycled back to the Imhoff tank with a recirculation rate of 50% (hydraulic loading rate = 0.37 m d(-1)). The system's performance varied throughout the study. In Period I (summer) consistently high load removal efficiencies of TN (89 +/- 5%) and a removal rate of 6.6 +/- 1.4 g TN m(-2) d(-1) were exhibited. In Period II (fall), the poor performance of the FWS during the senescence of macrophytes caused a large increase in organic matter, solids and nutrient concentrations, drastically deteriorating water quality. The determination of PPCPs was conducted during this period. Recalcitrant compounds, namely sulfamethoxazole, carbamazapine, TCEP and sucralose were negligibly removed in all CWs. However, noteworthy was the;approximate to 30%removal of sucralose in the VF wetland. Caffeine (80%) and fluoxetine (27%) showed similar elimination rates in both VF and HF units, whereas trimethoprim and DEET were significantly better removed in the VF than in the HF. The concentration of the four latter compounds showed a severe increase in the FWS, indicating possible desorption from the sediment/biomass during adverse conditions. Harvesting of the aboveground biomass in this unit returned the system 's performance back to normality (Period III), achieving 77 +/- 7% TN removal despite the winter season, proving effluent recirculation as an effective strategy for TN removal in hybrid CW systems when stringent restrictions are in place.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) tend to partially remove recalcitrant chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals. Among these, the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is of great environmental concern. In this work a continuously aerated submerged fixed bed bioreactor was used for the biological removal of EE2 at mu g L-1 levels.
   RESULTS: Removal efficiencies higher than 96% were obtained at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4.3 days and a volumetric loading rate (B-v) of 11 mu g EE2 L-1 d(-1). Increasing the B-v up to 40 and 143 mu g EE2 L-1 d(-1) led to slightly lower removal efficiencies, 81 and 74%, respectively. Nitrification was confirmed to be the main biological mechanism involved in EE2 removal. Most interestingly, the elimination of EE2 was not affected by the absence of ammonium in the feed, suggesting that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were able to maintain their population density and their activity, even after several months of starvation.
   CONCLUSION: The concept of an aerated submerged fixed bed bioreactor, capable of removing estrogens in a sustainable and biological way, shows great potential as an effluent polishing step for existing WWTPs. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical industry

AB Reports of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have raised substantial concern among important potable drinking water and reclaimed wastewater quality issues. Our study investigates the removal of EDC/PPCPs of 52 compounds having different physico-chemical properties (e.g., size, hydrophobicity, and polarity) by nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes using a dead-end stirred-cell filtration system. EDC/PPCPs were applied to the membrane in one model water and three natural waters. Experiments were performed at environmentally relevant initial EDC/PPCP concentrations ranging typically from 2 to < 250 ng/L. EDC/PPCP retention was quantified by liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy. A general separation trend due to hydrophobic adsorption as a function of octanol-water partition coefficient was observed between the hydrophobic compounds and porous hydrophobic membrane during the membrane filtration in unequilibrium conditions. The results showed that the NF membrane retained many EDC/PPCPs due to both hydrophobic adsorption and size exclusion, while the UF membrane retained typically hydrophobic EDC/PPCPs due mainly to hydrophobic adsorption. However, the transport phenomenon associated with adsorption may depend on water chemistry conditions and membrane material. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is rapidly increasing to respond to the ever-growing demands for water and food resources. However, this practice may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in agricultural settings. To evaluate this potential risk, we analyzed microbiomes and resistomes of soil and Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) root samples from pots irrigated with tap water spiked with 0, 20, or 100 mu g L-1 of a mixture of three antibiotics (Trimethoprim, Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole). The presence of antibiotics induced changes in bacterial populations, particularly in soil, as revealed by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Parallel shotgun sequencing identified a total of 56 different ARGs conferring resistance against 14 antibiotic families. Antibiotic-treated samples showed increased loads of ARGs implicated in mutidrug resistance or in both direct and indirect acquired resistance. These changes correlated with the prevalence of Xantomonadales species in the root microbiomes. We interpret these data as indicating different strategies of soil and root microbiomes to cope with the presence of antibiotics, and as a warning that their presence may increase the loads of ARBs and ARGs in edible plant parts, therefore constituting a potential risk for human consumers.

AB Investigation during 11-month period was performed to study the presence of caffeine in the Lis River in Leiria Town in Portugal, and a monitoring during 9-month period was realized to check the contribution of the human pollution of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) that discharge their effluents to the studied river. The samples were collected in five sampling points along the river and in two influents and two effluents of the studied WWTPs. Caffeine was detected in all ninety-one collected samples. The caffeine concentration ranged from 25.3 to 321 ng/L in the river samples, from 112 to 1927 ng/L in the WWTP effluents, and from 9478 to 83,901 ng/L in the WWTP influents. The highest concentration in the river was detected in the two sampling points located after the effluent discharge points and reached 315 and 321 ng/L. Risk assessment was performed for three trophic levels using the risk quotient calculation and revealed that caffeine do not cause toxic effect on Daphnia magna and on fish but could be possibly toxic to algae. The results proved that caffeine can be an effective indicator of human-born pollution.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs), such as pharmaceuticals, sterols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are frequently detected in the environment. ECs are refractory, toxic, tend to bioaccumulate and have a potential to disrupt the endocrine system of living organisms. These compounds are only partially eliminated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Due to their hydrophobic nature, they tend to accumulate in sludge. However, the fate of the majority of ECs in sludge treatment processes is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of a sequential anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic (AN/AERO/ANOX) digestion and a conventional single-stage AN digestion (as control) was investigated on mixed primary and secondary sludge. Digesters were operated at an overall solid retention time (SRT) of 18 days. The steady-state results have shown that sequential AN/AERO/ANOX digestion configurations improved the removal of three classes of ECs (e.g., sterols, PAHs and pharmaceuticals) by either reducing their accumulation or enhancing their removal. Moreover, sequential AN/AERO/ANOX digestion also achieved 45% less ammonia generation, 20% faster digestate dewaterability and 4% enhanced volatile solids removal compared to single-stage AN digestion.

AB To simulate complex pollutant conditions encountered in wastewater treatment plant influents, a solution containing three common pharmaceuticals was prepared. The adsorbents were exposed to various dilutions (1-100 mg/L) of a solution containing equal amounts carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim (TMP). The adsorbents were composed of varying proportions of sewage sludge and fish waste, such that the former represented 100%, 90%, 75% and 25% of the composition, while the remainder consisted of fish waste. Adsorption isotherms were used to determine adsorption capacity for each pharmaceutical. To understand the surface changes during adsorption, analysis by TA-MS and potentiometric titration were carried out. The results were compared to those obtained for single component pharmaceutical solutions. CBZ was consistently adsorbed from the multi-component solution in greater quantities than was either SMX or TMP on all adsorbents. The adsorption of SMX was most negatively impacted by the presence of multiple pharmaceuticals. The best adsorbent performance varied depending on the pharmaceutical, as the mechanism of adsorption varied between pharmaceuticals, with CBZ interacting more with the carbon phase of the material, whereas SMX and TMP were more apt to react with the inorganic content.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment raises many questions about risk to the environment and risk to human health. Researchers have attributed adverse ecological effect effects to the presence of these compounds, particularly EDCs, though there is no consensus on what risk, if any, these compounds pose to human health. The scientific community is in the process of developing a better understanding of the occurrence, fate, and transport of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in the environment, including a better characterization of human exposure via drinking water. This paper provides a brief review of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in drinking water, as well as uses examples from Lake Mead, Nevada, USA, to highlight the issues associated with their fate and transport. Lastly, the effects of natural or anthropogenically driven processes, like natural seasonal flow or climate-change/prolonged drought are discussed as they are factors which can drastically alter environmental concentrations of these compounds. Without question, the propensity for the contamination of fresh water will rise as (1) human population continues to grow or (2) patterns of natural surface water slow and wastewater becomes a larger fraction of flow further highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental behavior.

AB A novel Arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (nAES) assay has been developed for detection of estrogenic activity in various liquid samples such as wastewater, seawater, brackish water and swine urine Two bio-components were engineered to co-express the human estrogen receptor alpha (hER alpha) and an inducible reporter gene: either the non-conventional phytase gene (phyK, derived from Klebsiella sp ASR1) or the non-conventional tannase gene (ATAN1, derived from Am:a) Both reporters were put under the control of an Arxula derived glucoamylase (GM) promoter, which was modified by the insertion of two estrogen-responsive elements (EREs). The Arxula transformation/expression platform Xplor (R) 2, which lacks resistance markers and E. coli elements, was used to select stable mitotic transformants They were then analyzed for robustness and suitability as the bio-component for the nAES assay Two types of the nAES assay based on the reporter proteins phytase and tannase (nAES-P, nAES-T) were used in this work. The nAES-P type is more suitable for the analysis of seawater, brackish water and urine whereas the nAES-T type exhibited higher robustness to NaCl Both assay types have similar characteristics for the determination of estrogen in sewage and urine samples e g 6-25 h assay period with detection and determination limits and EC50 values for 17 beta-estradiol of 2 8 ng L-1, 5 9 ng L-1. 33 2 ng L-1 (nAES-P) and 3 1 ng L-1, 6 7 ng L-1 and 394 ng L-1 (nAES-T) Substrate specificity and analytical measurement range (AMR) for both assay types are also similar These characteristics show that the nAES assay based on non-conventional salt tolerant yeast is applicable for a high throughput estrogen analysis in the environmental and regulatory control sectors (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Progesterone, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, has been frequently detected in wastewater for decades, posing a serious threat to ecological and human health. However, it is still a challenge to achieve the effective detection of progesterone in complex matrices water samples. In this study, a novel adsorbent CNT@CS/P(MAA) was prepared by grafting methacrylic polymers on the surface of modified carbon nanomaterials. Compared with other reported materials, the hybrid carbon nanomaterial could selectively identify the progesterone in the complex industrial pharmaceutical wastewater, and its adsorption performance is almost independent of the pH and environmental temperature. In addition, this nanomaterial could be reused with a good recovery rate. The prepared nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results confirmed that the methacrylic polymers and chitosan layer were successfully grafted on the surface of carbon nanotubes. Adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, and selectivity tests showed that CNT@CS/P(MAA) had a high adsorption capacity (44.45 mg center dot g(-1)), a fast adsorption rate and a satisfied selectivity for progesterone. Then, CNT@CS/P(MAA) was used as solid phase extraction sorbent and combined with HPLC to enrich progesterone from the wastewater samples. Under the optimum conditions, a good linearity was obtained with the correlation coefficient was 0.9998, and the limit of detection was 0.003 ng center dot mL(-1). Therefore, this method could be used for the selective and effective detection of progesterone in industrial wastewater with complex substrates and provided a new method for the detection of progesterone in other environmental waters.

AB There is little quantitative information on the temporal trends of pharmaceuticals and other emerging compounds, including artificial sweeteners, in urban groundwater and their suitability as tracers to inform urban water management. In this study, pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners were monitored over 6 years in a shallow urban groundwater body along with a range of conventional sewage tracers in a network of observation wells that were specifically constructed to assess sewer leakage. Out of the 71 substances screened, 24 were detected at above the analytical detection limit. The most frequent compounds were the iodinated X-ray contrast medium amidotrizoic acid (35.3%), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (33.3%) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (27.5%), while all other substances occurred in less than 10% of the screened wells. The results from the group of specifically constructed focus wells within 10 m of defective sewers confirmed sewer leaks as being a major entrance pathway into the groundwater. The spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners corresponds well with predictions by pipeline leakage models, which operate on optical sewer condition monitoring data and hydraulic information. Correlations between the concentrations of carbamazepine. iodinated X-ray contrast media and artificial sweeteners were weak to non-existent. Peak concentrations of up to 4130 ng/l of amidotrizoic acid were found in the groundwater downstream of the local hospital. The analysis of 168 samples for amidotrizoic acid, taken at 5 different occasions, did not show significant temporal trends for the years 2002-2008, despite changed recommendations in the medical usage of amidotrizoic acid. The detailed results show that the current mass balance approaches for urban groundwater bodies must be adapted to reflect the spatially distributed leaks and the variable wastewater composition in addition to the lateral and horizontal groundwater fluxes.

AB The role of soluble microbial products (SMP), the most important component of effluent organic matter from municipal wastewater treatment plants, in sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-based advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) remains substantially unclear. In this study, we first utilized a suite of macro- and microanalytical techniques to characterize the SMP from a membrane bioreactor for its fundamental molecular, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties. The degradation kinetics of three representative pharmaceuticals (i.e., naproxen, gemfibrozil, and sulfadiazine) in the presence of SMP was significantly reduced as compared to in its absence. Possible mechanisms for the interference by SMP in degrading these target compounds (TCs) were investigated. The low percentage of bound TCs to SMP ruled out the cage effect. The measurement of steady-state O-1(2) concentration indicated that formation of O-1(2) upon UV irradiation on SMP was not primarily responsible for the degradation of TCs. However, the comparative and quenching results reveal that SMP absorbs UV light acting as an inner filter toward the TCs, and meanwhile scavenges SO4 center dot- with a high second-order rate constant of 2.48 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1).

AB Urban estuaries receive large volumes of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment facilities containing numerous contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals residues. Water was sampled for 16 highly prescribed pharmaceuticals at 17 sites along the Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary located in the Northeastern U.S. Pharmaceutical concentrations were highest in western LIS, ranging from non-detect to 71 ng L-1 and declining steadily eastward, while river samples from four major tributaries ranged from non-detect to 83 ng L-1. Two tracers, sucralose and caffeine, accurately predicted pharmaceutical behavior in LIS while only sucralose was effective at the river sites. Sucralose also tracked well with the salinity gradient in LIS, exhibiting conservative behavior along the transect. Attenuation factors were determined for measurable pharmaceuticals and compared against sucralose to estimate the magnitude of decline in concentrations that may be attributable to in situ degradation and partitioning. The results demonstrate sucralose's effectiveness as a tracer of wastewater-borne contaminants under estuarine conditions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over-the-counter pharmaceutical compounds can serve as microbial substrates in wastewater treatment processes as well as in the environment. The metabolic pathways and intermediates produced during their degradation, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate an anaerobic wastewater community that metabolizes naproxen via demethylation. Enriched cultures, established from anaerobic digester inocula receiving naproxen as the sole carbon source, transformed naproxen to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen (DMN) within 22 days. Continual enrichment and culture transfer resulted in consistent demethylation of naproxen with no loss of DMN observed. Methane was generated at 0.83 mmol per 1 mmol transformed naproxen. In addition to naproxen, the consortium readily demethylated syringic acid and vanillic acid. DNA analysis revealed a community of acetogenic bacteria and syntrophic acetate oxidizing archaea. Combined with the biotransformation data, this suggests the enriched consortium performs aromatic O-demethylation through a syntrophic relationship between specific acetogens, acetate oxidizers, and methanogens. The proposed model of carbon transfer through the anaerobic food web highlights the significance of linked community interactions in the anaerobic transformation of aromatic O-methyl compounds such as naproxen.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate interactions of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NP) and natural organic matter (NOM) in aqueous suspensions. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of particles of TiO2 NP and NOM in the suspensions ranged from 113 to 255 nm. During batch experiments the radioactivity resulting from (CIP)-C-14 was determined in the filtrate (filter pore size 100 nm) by scintillation measurements,
   to 72 h, no significant sorption of NOM to TiO2 NP was observed at a TiO2 NP concentration of 5 mg/L. When the concentration of TiO2 NP was increased to 500 mg/L, a small amount of NOM of 9.5% +/- 0.6% was sorbed at 72 h. The low sorption affinity of NOM on TiO2 NP surfaces could be explained by the negative charge of both components in alkaline media or by the low hydrophobicity of the NOM contents.
   a TiO2NP concentration of 5 mg L r, the sorption of CIP on TiO2 NP was insignificant (TiO2 NP/CIP ratio: 10). When the TiO2 NP/CIP ratio was increased to 1000, a significant amount of 53.6% +/- 7.2% of CIP was sorbed on TiO2 NP under equilibrium conditions at 64 h. In alkaline media, CIP is present mainly as zwitterions which have an affinity to sorb on negatively charged TiO2 NP surfaces. The sorption of CIP on TiO2 NP in the range of TiO2 NP concentrations currently estimated for municipal wastewater treatment plants is estimated to be rather low. The Freundlich sorption coefficients (K-F) in the presence of NOM of 2167 L-n mg mg(-n) kg(-1) was about 10 times lower than in the absence of NOM. This is an indication that the particle fraction of NOM < 100 nm could play a role as a carrier for ionic organic micro-pollutants as CIP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A halo-tolerant bacterial consortium comprised of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain R1, Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum R2 and Shewanella chilikensis strain AM1 were isolated and used as inoculums in a moving bed bioreactor for treatment of a saline petrochemical wastewater. Observations demonstrated the halo-tolerant capability of isolated strains up to around 3.2%. The influence of varying organic loading rates and TDS concentrations were evaluated on bioreactor efficiency and biokinetic coefficients. A COD removal of 77% was observed for organic loading rate of less than 2.7 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and TDS concentrations of 25,000 and 30,000 mg L-1. Growth yield (Y) varied from 0.178 to 0.129 mg VSS mg COD-1 in different TDS concentrations. Results indicated that the biokinetic coefficients were in the range close to typical ranges reported for similar industrial wastewaters, except that of the half saturation constant (K-s).

AB This study aimed at gaining knowledge on the degradation pathway during biological treatment of wastewater of diclofenac and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac, its main human metabolite. For that purpose, an aerobic MBR was acclimatised to diclofenac, and the MBR biomass subsequently incubated with C-14-diclofenac or C-14-4'hydroxydiclofenac over 25 days. It was demonstrated that diclofenac degradation was much slower and limited than that of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac. Indeed, after 18 days of batch incubation, diclofenac was removed up to 40%, this rate remained stable till the end of the experiment, while 4'-hydroxydiclofenac was completely degraded within nine days. The analyses of supernatant samples have shown that diclofenac degradation led to four transformation products, more polar than the parent compound, one of them being 4'-hydroxydiclofenac. The degradation of 4'-hydroxydiclofenac led to the formation of the same metabolites than those detected during diclofenac degradation. With these results, the hydroxylation of diclofenac to 4'-hydroxydiclofenac was identified as one major bottleneck in diclofenac degradation during biological treatment of wastewater.

AB Marine clams Ruditapes philippinarum were exposed under laboratory conditions to sediments sampled at five sites affected by wastewater effluents at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain). Contamination and early biological stress were determined. Metabolism and antioxidant system differed according to seasons. Health status diminished in summer. Metabolism of detoxification, and oxidative effect were related to concentration of metals, PAH, secondary alkane sulfonates (SAS) and antibiotics in winter. Antioxidant system and DNA damage were linked to metals and pharmaceutical products. Phase I and antioxidant system were associated to PAH and SAS in summer. Oxidative stress and effects were related to pharmaceuticals. Phase II was linked to metals and pharmaceuticals. Seasonality of sediment contamination by organic compounds and biological responses was determined. Clams were useful bioindicators, since the set of biomarkers applied was validated as potential tools for sediment quality assessment of wastewater discharges areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous in surface waters as a consequence of discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants. However, few studies have assessed the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals to fish in natural waters. In the present study, passive samplers and rainbow trout were experimentally deployed next to three municipal wastewater treatment plants in Finland to evaluate the degree of animal exposure. Pharmaceuticals from several therapeutic classes (in total 15) were analyzed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry in extracts of passive samplers and in bile and blood plasma of rainbow trout held at polluted sites for 10?d. Each approach indicated the highest exposure near wastewater treatment plant A and the lowest near that of plant C. Diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen were found in rainbow trout, and their concentrations in bile were 10 to 400 times higher than in plasma. The phase I metabolite hydroxydiclofenac was also detected in bile. Hence, bile proved to be an excellent sample matrix for the exposure assessment of fish. Most of the monitored pharmaceuticals were found in passive samplers, implying that they may overestimate the actual exposure of fish in receiving waters. Two biomarkers, hepatic vitellogenin and cytochrome P4501A, did not reveal clear effects on fish, although a small induction of vitellogenin mRNA was observed in trout caged near wastewater treatment plants B and C.

AB In this work, it is studied the treatment of real wastewater (intensified with two target compounds) using electro-irradiated technologies. Two types of effluents coming from an organic-synthesis pharmaceutical industry and the outlet of a municipal wastewater treatment plant were intensified with metoprolol (beta-blocker) and caffeine (stimulant), respectively. Conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO), photolysis, sonolysis and all possible combinations among these technologies were evaluated for the treatment of both wastes. Results demonstrate that complete oxidation of the target compounds, as well as mineralization of the organic compounds contained in the matrixes, can be attained by all electro-irradiated technologies and no salt addition was needed to obtain an efficient treatment. Single irradiated technologies were inefficient in the oxidation but their combination with CDEO improves significantly the efficiency of the process showing clear synergistic effects. However, due to the large energy requirement of ultrasound irradiation, this combination is only cost-effective in the case of ultraviolet irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since most of the existing wastewater treatment options lack the ability to treat micro-contaminants, the increased use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and release as human waste have become a serious concern in recent years. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are a low-cost technology for wastewater treatment, however, its performance in term of PPCPs removal has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to characterize the removal factors and efficiency of acetaminophen (ACT) removal by CWs. The results revealed the decreased concentrations of ACT with increasing hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 0, 3, 5 days. The contribution of removal factors was found to be varied with initial ACT concentration. At the low ACT concentration (i.e. 1 ppb), plant uptake was the dominant, followed by microbial and photolytic removal. In contrast, at the high ACT concentration (i.e. 100 ppb), microbial and photolytic removal were found as dominant factors. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration was found at higher level in the plant shoot than in the root probably due to occurrence of the Fenton reaction resulting in PPCPs removal.

AB Microbacterium sp. strain BR1 is a bacterial strain that recently received attention for its capability to mineralize sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and other sulfonamides. In this study, the survival of Microbacterium sp. in municipal sludge waters was tested in batch experiments to explore optimal process conditions. Inoculation of Microbacterium sp. was subsequently performed in a pilot membrane bioreactor (MBR) operated in two configurations: treating full-scale MBR permeate (post-treatment) and treating raw municipal wastewater. SMX removal by Microbacterium sp. could not be proved in any of the configurations, except for SMX concentrations far higher than the ones normally found in municipal wastewater. By use of molecular tools (fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis) a low capability to survive in activated sludge systems was assessed. After inoculation, Microbacterium sp. was reduced to a small fraction of the viable biomass. The observed growth rate appeared to be many times lower than the one of typical activated sludge micro-organisms. Possibilities of application in full-scale municipal wastewater treatment are scarce.

AB A fast and simple method for the analysis of 17 commonly used antibiotics in Finland in water samples was developed. The method combines online solid phase extraction using a reusable online trapping column combined with analytical separation on a C-18 analytical column and detection by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The method was fully validated for detection and quantification limits as well as linearity, repeatability, and matrix effects. The method gave an excellent linear response (r (2) > 0.99) and detection limits for all compounds (1-10 ng(-1)), except for tetracycline (20 ng l(-1)) and roxithromycin (50 ng l(-1)). The repeatability was evaluated at two concentrations, and the values at 5 ng l(-1) ranged from 5 to 39% and at 100 ng l(-1) ranged from 3 to 19%. To test the method on real samples at low environmental concentrations, water samples collected from a river receiving discharges from two wastewater treatment plants were analyzed as well as samples from a pristine river. Seven antibiotics as well as carbamazepine were detected in the samples. The concentration of the compounds ranged from 5 to 81 ng l(-1).

AB We developed a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method for the high throughput determination of 28 common veterinary antibiotics in swine wastewater using one-step dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) for sample cleanup and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for detection. The orthogonal test method was used to systematically investigate the parameters that might influence d-SPE efficiency. The optimal d-SPE procedure utilized 40 mg primary secondary amine sorbent and 3 g L-1 Na(2)EDTA. The recoveries ranged from 50 to 100% with relative standard deviations <20% for all target analytes except for enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for all the analytes ranged from 0.002 to 0.200 ng mL(-1) and 0.005-0.500 ng mL(-1), respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 28 antibiotic residues in swine wastewater from 10 pig farms located in central China. Fourteen antibiotics including 4 sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfamonomethoxine and trimethoprim), 5 fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefioxacin, enrofloxacin, and ofloxacin), 1 lincosamide (lincomycin) and 4 tetracyclines (doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline) were detected at levels ranging from 0.0560 to 1793 ng mL(-1). Our results demonstrated that the optimized method is a simple but reliable analytical technique for the routine monitoring of veterinary antibiotics in swine wastewater. Swine wastewater samples that we analyzed from 10 pig farms in Jiangxi Province, China were highly contaminated and pose a serious threat to ecosystems and to public health. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and distribution of tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethazine (SMZ), and the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated in six agricultural sites in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in southern China. Irrigation water and irrigated soils at two different depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were analyzed. The total concentrations of TC and SMZ in irrigation water ranged from 69.3 to 234 ng/L and from 4.00 to 58.2 ng/L, respectively, while the total concentrations of TC and SMZ in irrigated soils ranged from 5.00 to 21.9 mu g/kg and from 1.30 to 4.20 mu g/kg, respectively. After long-term irrigation with domestic and fishpond wastewater in the field, the residual TC and SMZ and their corresponding ARGs in soils were significantly higher in fishpond-irrigated soils (Dongguan and Shenzhen) than in domestic wastewater-irrigated soils (Foshan, Guangzhou, Huizhou and Zhongshan). The concentrations of antibiotics and their ARGs were significantly higher in irrigation water than in irrigated soils, which indicated that wastewater was the primary source of antibiotics in the soil environments. The domestic and fishpond wastewater were important repositories of antibiotics and their ARGs, which require effective treatment before their discharge into the environment. Other factors such as soil physicochemical properties, manure application, irrigation water sources and (Topping patterns also affect the antibiotic concentrations and ARG abundances. The residual antibiotic concentrations statistically correlated with the corresponding ARGs in irrigation water and irrigated soils, both of which decreased with increasing soil depth, indicating that the concentration of antibiotics in the environment exerted a selection pressure on the microorganisms in the environment.

AB The results of an inter-laboratory comparison exercise to determine cytostatic anticancer drug residues in surface water, hospital wastewater and wastewater treatment plant effluent are reported. To obtain a critical number of participants, an invitation was sent out to potential laboratories identified to have the necessary knowledge and instrumentation. Nine laboratories worldwide confirmed their participation in the exercise. The compounds selected (based on the extent of use and laboratories capabilities) included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, etoposide, methotrexate and cisplatinum. Samples of spiked waste (hospital and wastewater treatment plant effluent) and surface water, and additional non-spiked hospital wastewater, were prepared by the organising laboratory (JoA3/4ef Stefan Institute) and sent out to each participant partner for analysis. All analytical methods included solid phase extraction (SPE) and the use of surrogate/internal standards for quantification. Chemical analysis was performed using either liquid or gas chromatography mass (MS) or tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry. Cisplatinum was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A required minimum contribution of five laboratories meant that only cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide could be included in the statistical evaluation. z-score and Q test revealed 3 and 4 outliers using classical and robust approach, respectively. The smallest absolute differences between the spiked values and the measured values were observed in the surface water matrix. The highest within-laboratory repeatability was observed for methotrexate in all three matrices (CV a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 12 %). Overall, inter-laboratory reproducibility was poor for all compounds and matrices (CV 27-143 %) with the only exception being methotrexate measured in the spiked hospital wastewater (CV = 8 %). Random and total errors were identified by means of Youden plots.

AB Pharmaceuticals are continually being introduced into the influent of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Developing a better understanding of pharmaceutical removal mechanisms within the different treatment processes is vital in preventing downstream contamination of our water resources. in this study, ibuprofen, a popular over-the-counter pain reliever, was monitored by taking wastewater samples throughout the City of Guelph municipal WWTP. Greater than 95% of ibuprofen was found to be removed in the aeration tank, with aerobic biodegradation being the dominant mechanism. For comparison, first-order kinetics were used to quantify ibuprofen biodegradation in a conventional WWTP aeration tank and in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant. The rate constants, k(biol), for the conventional tank and the MBR were determined to be (-6.8 +/- 3.3) L/g SS*d and (-8.4 +/- 4.0) L/g SS*d, respectively. These two rate constants were found to be statistically similar. Preliminary study of a biological nutrient removal pilot system also suggests that ibuprofen can be anaerobically degraded.

AB Total and dissolved rare earth element (REEs) and U concentrations were determined for waters from Lake Paranod (Brasilia, Brazil) sampled in the dry (November 2012) and wet seasons (July 2013). Shale-normalized REE patterns of all samples display the M-type lanthanide tetrad effect and large positive Gd anomalies, but only the total REE pool shows a positive Ce anomaly, possibly reflecting aeolian and/or fluvial input from surrounding laterites. The positive Gd anomaly increased strongly between 2012 and 2013. It reveals an anthropogenic dissolved Gd source that enters the lake with effluents from wastewater treatment plants, originating from the use of Gd-based contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. Because anthropogenic Gd is a tracer for other wastewater-derived substances, such as pharmaceuticals, REE geochemistry offers an inexpensive way to monitor the presence of wastewater-derived substances in the lake, which may be utilized as a drinking water reservoir in the near future.

AB This research investigates the toxic organic compounds biodegradation efficiency of two-stage activated sludge systems with (bioaugmented) and without aged sludge bioaugmentation (non-bioaugmented). The influent was a mixture of leachate and agriculture wastewater (1:1, v/v), used as the representative high strength wastewater. The bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented systems were operated in parallel, with three levels (low, moderate, and high) of concentrations of organics, nitrogen, and toxic organic compounds in the influent (conditions 1, 2, and 3). The results showed that both systems could efficiently degrade the organic compounds. Nevertheless, the toxic organic compounds biodegradation efficiency of the bioaugmented system was higher than that of the non-bioaugmented one. The bioaugmentation enhanced the overall removal efficiency under conditions 1 and 2. However, the bioaugmented system became less effective under condition 3. Further analysis indicated that the bacterial groups essential to the toxic organic compounds biodegradation were abundant in the aged sludge, including heterotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria, and nitrifying bacteria. The abundance of the effective bacteria improved the biodegradation and wastewater treatment performance of the bioaugmented system. In essence, the aged sludge bioaugmentation is a viable and eco-friendly solution to improving the treatment efficiency of the biological activated sludge system, despite limited biodegradation efficiency in an elevated compounds-concentration environment.

AB In this work, the feasibility of the CWPO-Photoassisted process for the on-site treatment of real hospital wastewaters has been evaluated using the low-cost mineral ilmenite. The ability of the process for the degradation of pharmaceuticals was firstly demonstrated in both deionized water and hospital wastewater matrices. Although the latter led to slow constant rates due to scavenging effects (0.42 and 0.02 min(-1), respectively), the complete elimination of the pharmaceuticals was reached in both cases operating at 30 degrees C and using 1 g L-1 ilmenite. The complete removal of coliforms in the hospital wastewater was also achieved. The treatment of the hospital wastewater was fairly efficient (TOC conversion above 80% in 5 h reaction time) operating at 50 degrees C with a catalyst load of 1 g L-1 and the stoichiometric amount of H2O2, which was attributed to the combination of both CWPO and photocatalytic reactions. A lumped kinetic model allowed to describe fairly well the evolution of the global parameters viz. TOC and H2O2 along the process where both CWPO and photocatalytic reactions were considered. The unique properties of ilmenite allowed the fast degradation of the organic pollutants by CWPO into hydroxylated species, while further photocatalysis led to the formation of short-chain organic acids and their subsequent mineralization. Finally, the stability of ilmenite was confirmed upon three sequential runs.

AB Many different excipients are used in galenical pharmaceutical production, in addition to the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Excipients are little investigated regarding their environmental fate and impact, even though some of them are used in appreciable quantities. For 35 excipients used in galenical production at Roche Basle and Roche Kaiseraugst, both in Switzerland, in the years 2013 and 2014, the environmentally relevant properties were collated. A predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was calculated for the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the receiving water, the River Rhine for both sites, based on maximum daily losses of the single excipients to wastewater, derived by mass balance, and the site-specific dilution factor. Predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived for the WWTPs and the River Rhine. PECs and PNECs were compared for the WWTPs and the receiving water, in an environmental risk assessment. Additionally, to simulate a worst case scenario, certain galenical productions where given excipients are used in the highest amounts were assumed to take place in parallel on the same day, resulting in theoretical maximum excipient losses to wastewater. All PEC/ PNEC risk characterisation ratios for the excipients currently used by Roche in Switzerland are well below 1 throughout. Together with the fact that based on biodegradability data many excipients will be removed in the WWTP, this indicates that the excipients currently used do not present a risk to the environment.

AB Seventy-three commonly administered pharmaceuticals from twelve different therapeutic classes were investigated at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in northern Italy featuring a conventional activated sludge system (full-scale) and a polishing horizontal subsurface flow bed (pilot plant). Removal of these micro-pollutants by the two systems was assessed in order to evaluate their respective contributions. Mean concentrations and standard deviations were calculated and found to differ for the compounds detected, ranging from few ng/L to over 1165 ng/L in the secondary effluent and from 11 to 533 in the polished effluent. Eighteen compounds were consistently below the detection limit and the remaining 55 compounds were found at a minimum of one sampling point.
   Average removal efficiencies of both treatment steps and in treatment train as a whole are evaluated and discussed, highlighting the difficulties in predicting the fate of pharmaceuticals in both an activated sludge system and a horizontal subsurface flow bed. Comparison between the observed average removal efficiencies and those reported in the literature was also carried out for the pharmaceuticals of interest, and the discrepancies that emerged are discussed. The investigated constructed wetland did show efficacy in removing some of these compounds, and it contributed to the overall removal efficiency of each therapeutic class. Indeed, evaluation of the specific mass loadings of each class of PhC detected in the raw wastewaters, secondary and polished effluent evidences that the investigated constructed wetland is able to further reduce the load of micropollutants, which could become a necessity, especially where the receiving water body is an effluent-dominant river and mitigation measures of the discharge impact are required to protect and safeguard the aquatic environment.

AB Rivers are ecosystems affected first by environmental pollution. Pollutants originating from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities are firstly involved in rivers. At times when the human population was low, waste materials that had been mixed into rivers could be diluted in a short distance and disintegrated from natural routes. However, with the excessive population growth and industrialization that accompanied development, domestic and industrial wastes also multiplied and the rivers became unable to clean themselves.ln the Northeastern Mediterranean, where the freshwater is exposed to a wide variety of different wastewater, it is inevitable for the settlement centers in the vicinity to leave the Iskenderun Gulf, which is a commercially important region, irreversibly polluted.In this study, accumulation levels of 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormones were investigated in the chemicals that disturbed the endocrine system that caused the pollution of some freshwater sources pouring into Iskenderun Bay and started to worry scientists in the last decade.In our country, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) hormone levels were found to be high in all freshwater resources covered by the study, according to the Regulation on the Monitoring of Surface Waters and Underground Waters in which the Water Framework Directive was implemented at the national level.

AB The adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol, a toxic by-product of triclosan commonly found in wastewater treatment plant effluents, was studied on paper sludge/wheat husks biochar. By using response surface methodology, the optimum conditions and effects of pH, temperature, initial 2,4-DCP concentration and time were determined. The solution pH was found to be the most influential parameter whereas the optimum adsorption conditions were predicted as: C-0 = 40.28 mg L-1, T = 326 K, pH = 2.8, t = 143 min, where a 99.95% adsorption could be achieved. Both Langmuir and Freundlich provided a good fit for the experimental data, indicating a surface and multi-layer adsorption. Kinetically, the process primarily followed the pseudo-second order model (chemisorption). By comparing the adsorption capacity at equilibrium of our main biochar (q(e) = 9.28 mg g(-1)) to 3 biochars prepared from different biomasses (q(e) values 1.57-2.96 mg g(-1)), it was concluded that pH-dependent electrostatic interactions and non-covalent pi-electron donor-acceptor mechanisms play the most important role. Finally, there was indication that high concentrations of Ca and K may promote the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and enhance adsorption.

AB Nowadays, the number of treatment plants has been increasing due to advancing technology and industrialization throughout Turkey and the world. This situation brings with it the need to analyse the features of the wastewater of treatment plants and treatment sludge in a more detailed way. In recent years, it has been remarkable to see studies conducted on endocrine disrupting substances (EDCs) in wastewaters and treatment sludge and the effects of these substances on the environment and public health. Being one of the estrogenic hormones, which are EDCs and which are found naturally in organisms, 17-estradiol and estrone are highly important for the ecological balance. In the adsorption studies for the removal of estrogenic hormones, removal efficiencies, adsorption isotherms, kinetic values and thermodynamic studies have been conducted for 17-estradiol and estrone. In adsorption studies, isotherm calculations are made with 90% and over removal efficiency and it is seen that the adsorption is in conformity with the Freundlich isotherm. Following the kinetic calculations, it is also seen that the adsorption is in conformity with the second-order rate equations. Following the analysis of the adsorption thermodynamically, G Gibbs free energy is found to be positive and enthalpy and entropy variations are also found to be positive.

AB This study investigated the oxidation of the oral contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) during ozonation. First, the effect of ozone (O-3) on the estrogenic activity of aqueous solutions of EE2 was studied using a yeast estrogen screen (YES). It could be shown that O-3 doses typically applied for the disinfection of drinking waters were sufficient to reduce estrogenicity by a factor of more than 200. However, it proved impossible to completely remove estrogenic activity due to the slow reappearance of 0.1 - 0.2% of the initial EE2 concentration after ozonation. Second, oxidation products formed during ozonation of EE2 were identified with LC-MS/MS and GC/MS and the help of the model compounds 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthol (THN) and 1-ethinyl-1-cyclohexanol (ECH),which represent the reactive phenolic moiety and the ethinyl group of EE2. Additionally, oxidation products of the natural steroid hormones 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) were identified. The chemical structures of the oxidation products were significantly altered as compared to the parent compounds, explaining the diminished estrogenic activity after ozonation. Overall, the results demonstrate that ozonation is a promising tool for the control of EE2, E2, and El in drinking water and wastewater.

AB Effluent-impacted surface water has the potential to transport not only water, but wastewater-derived contaminants to shallow groundwater systems. To better understand the effects of effluent discharge on in-stream and near-stream hydrologic conditions in wastewater-impacted systems, water-level changes were monitored in hyporheic-zone and shallow-groundwater piezometers in a reach of Fourmile Creek adjacent to and downstream of the Ankeny ( Iowa, USA) wastewater treatment plant ( WWTP). Water-level changes were monitored from approximately 1.5 months before to 0.5 months after WWTP closure. Diurnal patterns in WWTP discharge were closely mirrored in stream and shallow-groundwater levels immediately upstream and up to 3 km downstream of the outfall, indicating that such discharge was the primary control on water levels before shutdown. The hydrologic response to WWTP shutdown was immediately observed throughout the study reach, verifying the far-reaching hydraulic connectivity and associated contaminant transport risk. The movement of WWTP effluent into alluvial aquifers has implications for potential WWTP-derived contamination of shallow groundwater far removed from the WWTP outfall.

AB The degradation of seven compounds which are usually recalcitrant in classical activated sludge treatment (e.g., diclofenac, propranolol, iopromide, iohexol, iomeprol tebuconazole and propiconazole) was studied in a biofilm reactor (slow sand filtration). This reactor was used to treat real effluent-wastewater at different flow rates (hydraulic loadings) under aerobic conditions so removal and degradation kinetics of these recalcitrant compounds were calculated. With the hydraulic loading rate of 0.012 m(3) m (2) h(-1) the reactor removed 41, 94, 58,57 and 85% of diclofenac, propranolol, iopromide, iohexol and iomeprol respectively. For these compounds the removal efficiency was dependent on hydraulic residence-times. Only 59 and 21% of the incoming tebuconazole and propiconazole respectively were removed but their removal did not depend on hydraulic residence time. Biofilm reactors are thus efficient in removing micro-pollutants and could be considered as an option for advanced treatment in small wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, treatability of etodolac chemical synthesis wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry was investigated in a hybrid ozonation-Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) system. The AnMBR was successfully operated up to 7500 mg/L of chemical oxygen demand (COD), but sulfite inhibition occurred at this loading. A pre-ozonation process was applied to overcome the problem of sulfite inhibition resulted from raw wastewater by decreasing the sulfite concentration through oxidation to sulphate. Furthermore, it was shown that this process was also effective obtaining high etodolac removal efficiencies up to 99%. Approximately 90% COD removal efficiency was achieved by the combined system. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) decreased in the conditions of long sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and low organic loading rate (OLR) values. Therefore, the granule size also decreased during the entire operation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that high sulfite concentration affected the microbial population in the order of methanogens, acedogens and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB).

AB The pharmaceutical valsartan is classified as a trace organic compound and is released into wastewater from human consumption. Trace organic compounds are not completely removed during conventional wastewater treatment. In order to prevent their release into the aquatic environment, advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as ozonation are currently implemented. Ozonation leads to the formation of transformation products (TPs), which then enter the receiving waters. In the present work, laboratory-scale ozonation experiments of valsartan solutions were performed. The resulting TPs were analyzed by HPLC-MS and searched for using a non-targeted approach. Of the 51 compounds detected, 27 have tentative structural suggestions based on MS/MS experiments. Ozonation of valsartan does not lead to the formation of TPs with higher toxicity towards A. fischeri than the parent compound. According to QSAR-based environmental behavior estimations, most TPs reveal lower lipophilicity, increased biodegradability as well as decreased acute and chronic toxicities concerning fish, daphnia and algae compared to their parent compound valsartan.

AB Evidence of ecotoxicological effects of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) has increased research into their environmental fate. In low and low-middle income countries (LLMICs) the main source of APIs to surface waters is from discharge of untreated wastewater. Consequently, concentrations of APIs can be relatively high in the "impact zone" downstream of a discharge point. Little is known about the fate of APIs in these impact zones. In this laboratory scale investigation, the effect of successive dilution of synthetic untreated wastewater (dilution factor 1 to 10) on the distribution of APIs was studied. The sorption was consistent with the chemical properties of each compound: charge, lipophilicity, and structure. Dilution increased desorption of the basic and neutral APIs (up to 27.7%) and correlated with their lipophilicity (R-2 > 0.980); the positive charge was of secondary importance. Anions did not significantly desorb (< 10% loss). Increased concentrations of dissolved organic matter at dilutions of 8 and 10 times that of untreated wastewater coincided with lower dissolved API concentrations. The data showed a dear trend in the desorption process of APIs that may lead to higher exposure risk than anticipated. Therefore, it is suggested that these aspects should be accounted for in the development of dedicated environmental risk assessment approach for APIs in riverine impact zones of LLMICs countries.

AB Wastewater reuse is important to address the challenge of water shortage but direct reuse could still introduce undesired contaminants to final products, e.g., via agricultural irrigation. Advanced membrane treatment such as forward osmosis can further purify the treated wastewater with recovery of high quality water. Herein, a forward osmosis - electrodialysis (FO-ED) hybrid system has been investigated by using diammonium phosphate (DAP), a common fertilizer, as a non-regeneration draw solute to achieve water reclamation and mitigation of salinity buildup. The system achieved consistent water recovery in the FO with low specific reverse solute flux for both NH4+-N (0.063 g L-1) and PO43--P (0.083 g L-1). Intensified fouling condition was observed when actual treated wastewater was applied as the feed, requiring periodical membrane cleaning. There were only Na+, Cl-, and small amounts of organics being presented in the recovered water (diluted draw solution of FO) at an acceptable level towards water reuse for agricultural irrigation. The ED accomplished successful recovery of 96.6 +/- 3.0% reverse-fluxed DAP under 3.0 V 1-h daily operation, which could be reused in the FO. The energy consumption of the hybrid system was as low as 0.72 kWh m(-3) or 0.45 kWh kg(-1) DAP. These results have demonstrated a synergy between FO and ED for creating an energy-efficient solution to enhance wastewater reuse.

AB An investigation to study the distribution and persistence of cephalosporins in the cephalosporin producing wastewater was carried out in this paper. The target cephalosporins included ceftriaxone (CRO), cefalexin (CEF), cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin (CZO), cefuroxime (CXM), cefoxitin (CFX) and cefradine (CF). A rapid and reliable detection method for cephalosporins was established based on solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. In the cephalosporin producing wastewater effluent (CPWWeff), the limit of quantification for the targets ranged from 27.5 ng/L to 131.8 ng/L, and the recoveries for all of the analytes ranged from 73% to 102%. The mean concentrations of the seven cephalosporins were 12.85-141.55 mu g/L and 0.05-24.38 mu g/L in cephalosporin producing wastewater influent and effluent, respectively. Although high removal efficiencies were achieved for the cephalosporins (78.8-99.7%), up to 1.9 kg of cephalosporins was discharged per day from the investigated C-WWTP. The degradation processes of CRO, CEF, CZO and CXM followed first-order kinetics in CPWWeff under all of the testing conditions. The degradation rates of tested cephalosporins were accelerated by high temperature and light. Persistence of CXM was the highest among the four tested cephalosporins in CPWWeff.

AB This work is the first-ever study of the concurrence of four insecticides (chlorantraniliprole, imidacloprid, pirimicarb and thiamethoxam) and their main transformation products (TPs) in soil and pepper crop irrigated with reclaimed and non-reclaimed water under agricultural field conditions. Field experiments were conducted using different irrigation supplies: control water (CW), wastewater polluted with phytosanitary commercial products containing the studied insecticides (WW) and reclaimed wastewater after a photocatalytic processing with TiO2/ Na2S2O8 at pilot plant under sunlight (RWW). Photocatalytic treatments removed most of the insecticides and their TPs generated during the photoperiod. Neither target insecticides nor their TPs were detected in pepper samples when CW and RWW were used as irrigation source, whereas the four insecticides and two TPs were detected when WW was used. In the experiment carried out with WW, all insecticides and eight TPs were detected in soil samples. The impact of using reclaimed water on the quality of pepper crop was also assessed, showing barely any significant difference.

AB Herein we report on the interactions between two common pharmaceuticals and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) enter wastewater treatment plants from industrial and household sewers. These chemicals are not completely removed during wastewater processing, and in many countries, are being found in drinking water sources and in surface waters downstream of wastewater treatment plants. If treated wastewater effluent is re-used to irrigate crops, the potential adverse interactions between PPCPs and plants needs to be understood. beta-estradiol and gemfibrozil appeared to affect wheat seedlings through oxidative stress, as indicated by increases in lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide, carotenoid, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, plant cell damage in wheat seedlings was indicated by an increase in electrolyte leakage. Although our study was not designed to elucidate possible mechanisms, the changes in activity of plant enzymes in response to some pharmaceuticals is likely the consequence of oxidative stress and the initiation of pathways to protect the plant from further cell damage.

AB The wide use of Acetaminophen (ACT) for pain relief and lack of ability of most wastewater treatment plants to treat ACT residues have increased the risk of surface and groundwater contamination. Constructed wetlands (CW) are a low cost technology for effective wastewater treatment to treat micro-pollutants through the roles of CW media such as adsorption and Fenton reaction. This study aimed to characterize the potential of laterite soil as a CW media for ACT removal from wastewater through Fenton reaction. The experimental data showed enrichment of rhizosphere with exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under ACT contaminant water (hospital wastewater). The contributions of plant uptake and Fenton reaction for ACT removal were found to be 0.04-1.35 and 35.34%, respectively. Media adsorption together with other factors (i.e., microbial degradation and by-product transformation) constituted about 60.76-64.61% of ACT removal. The laterite soil media coupling Fenton reaction was found promising due to advanced degradation of ACT, yielding inorganic, and less toxic final products.

AB Membrane bioreactor technology has become increasingly popular for treating various industry wastewater because of its high treatment efficiency, small footprint and excellent effluent quality. Performance of aerobic granules (AG) and activated sludge (AS)-based submerged membrane bioreactors implemented for tomato paste processing wastewater treatment was investigated and compared in this work, particularly in terms of membrane fouling and microbial community structure at different conditions. The results revealed that the chemical oxygen demand in the aerobic granular system showed slightly better removal efficiencies (92%) than those in the activated sludge system (90%) while the performance of activated sludge membrane bioreactor is more stable over the experimental test time. According to the total filtration resistance, the aerobic granular system demonstrated superiority initially, while the activated sludge system performed better with disintegrated aerobic granules. Indeed, the membrane fouling resulted from disintegrated aerobic granules was most serious, which was further confirmed by atomic force microscopy. In addition, the cleaning efficiency was 96% in the aerobic granular system, which was nearly 10% higher than that of the activated sludge system. The difference between the bacterial community structures in both systems was analyzed, and the dominant bacteria were transformed into Rhodocyclaceae and ASSO-13 at the family level indicating that consortia gradually became the predominant bacteria in the tomato paste processing wastewater.

AB A reliable multiclass method has been developed and validated for the determination of eight antibiotics from distinct classes (sulfonamides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, cephalosporins and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors) in wastewater - influent and effluent and surface water from Porto Alegre, Brazil. The pre-concentration and clean-up was conducted with a simple and fast protocol using solid-phase extraction allowing a 100-fold concentration factor. The proposed method was validated by using spiked blank wastewater samples in terms of linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, recovery, matrix effects and limits of detection and quantification. Recovery was obtained in the range of 66-149%. Method limit of quantification ranged between 1.6 and 61.7 ng L-1. Samples (n = 16) were taken from January to August 2011 in one wastewater treatment plant, which uses conventional biological treatment. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim show higher concentration, ranging from >10 to <6500 ng L-1, whereas erythromycin presented the lower amount. Differences between influent and effluent profiles were discussed. Surface water samples (n = 8) were collected in Arroio Diluvio, in four sampling points, in February 2012. From the eight antibiotics analysed, five were detected: sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azythromicyn, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, in a concentration range of 376-572 ng L-1, 27-94 ng L-1, 24-40 ng L-1, 16-66ng L-1 and 30-54 ng L-1, respectively.

AB European policy is direct towards increasing the agricultural reuse of sludge on soil for improving the fertility; however, the effects of long-term pharmaceutical sewage sludge (PSS) application on soil properties are still unknown. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the agronomic and environmental effects on soil after 17 years of organic amendment with PSS derived from daptomycin production. Five different doses of PSS were spread on lands located in Anagni, Central Italy. Physico-chemical soil properties were investigated, as well as total and bioavailable heavy metals, changes in the soil organic matter quality and biochemical functioning.
   PSS application showed a positive agronomic potential, improving SOM quality, increasing soil humified organic matter and raising plant nutrients. SOM dynamic was different at low and high PSS supplies, as confirmed by the chemical and biochemical analysis (e.g. C biomass, FDA hydrolysis activity, basal respiration, dehydrogenase, urease and phosphatase activities). However, in a long-term agticultural reuse, environmental risks of PSS recycling were related to the increase of some heavy metals (Hg, Zn and Cu) and exchangeable Na. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The fate and behaviour of two groups of endocrine disrupting chemicals, steroid estrogens and nonylphenol ethoxylates, have been evaluated during the anaerobic digestion of primary and mixed sewage sludge under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Digestion occurred over six retention times, in laboratory scale reactors, treating sludges collected from a sewage treatment works in the United Kingdom. It has been established that sludge concentrations of both groups of compounds demonstrated temporal variations and that concentrations in mixed sludge were influenced by the presence of waste activated sludge as a result of transformations during aerobic treatment. The biodegradation of total steroid estrogens was >50% during primary sludge digestion with lower removals observed for mixed sludge, which reflected bulk organic solids removal efficiencies. The removal of nonylphenol ethoxylates was greater in mixed sludge digestion (>58%) compared with primary sludge digestion and did not reflect bulk organic removal efficiencies. It is apparent that anaerobic digestion reduces the concentrations of these compounds, and would therefore be expected to confer a degree of protection against exposure and transfer of both groups of compounds to the receiving/re-use environment.

AB The behaviour of 13 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) has been studied during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge: two musks (Galaxolide and Tonalide), one tranquilliser (Diazepam), one anti-epileptic (Carbamazepine), three anti-phlogistics (Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Diclofenac), two antibiotics (Sulfamethoxazole and Roxithromycin), one X-ray contrast medium (Iopromide) and three oestrogens (Estrone, 17 beta-oestradiol and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol). Two parallel processes have been carried out, one in mesophilic range (37 degrees C) and the other in thermophilic range (55 degrees C). The influence of temperature and sludge retention time (SRT) has been analysed. Among the substances considered, the higher removal efficiencies were achieved for the antibiotics, natural oestrogens, musks and Naproxen. For the other compounds, the values ranged between 20% and 60%, except for Carbamazepine, which showed no elimination. The removal of oestrogens, Diazepam and Diclofenac occurred after sludge adaptation. In general, no influence of SRT and temperature on PPCPs removal was observed.
   Considering the difficulty of obtaining reliable PPCPs concentrations, especially those corresponding to the fractions sorbed onto sludge, a methodology to validate the experimental data has been developed and successfully applied. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, conditions of solid phase extraction (SPE) for determination of some antibiotics such as trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azythromycin, doxycycline, sulfamethazine, ciprofloxacin, chlortetracycline, sulfamethoxazole in wastewaters were optimized. After the optimum volume and pH of the sample were determined, the effect of the concentration of the compounds and matrix were investigated. The highest recovery rates for antibiotic compounds were determined between 82% and 105% in 200 mL sample volume and pH 2.5. Then, antibiotic compounds were investigated in influent and effluent samples taken from Konya Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant. The concentration of the antibiotics was detected range of 0.11-101 ng/L in influent waters and <dl-288 ng/L in effluent samples in wastewater treatment plant. Hazard quotients (HQs) of antibiotic compounds determined in WWTP effluents to evaluate the risk towards different aquatic organisms (algae, Daphnia magna and fish) were determined. Azythromycin for fish and erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin for algae posed a moderate risk while azythromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, oxytetracycline posed a high risk for algae in the receiving environment.

AB The concept of immobilization technology has been incorporated in this research study for biomethanation of high strength herbal based pharmaceutical wastewater. Accordingly, an investigation has been made on laboratory scale to assess the feasibility of an anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor system to pre-treat herbal-based pharmaceutical wastewater with recourse to energy recovery, including influence of operating conditions. The work was carried out with laboratory-scale upflow reactor, equipped with nylon scrubber as random support. The reactor was operated at 35 degreesC. COD removal efficiencies ranging from 76 to 98% were achieved for organic loading rates upto 10 kgCOD/m(3) d, while the highest organic loading rate (around 48 kg COD/m(3) d) led to efficiencies of 46-50%. The influences of hydraulic retention time and substrate concentration were also studied. The reactors did now show destabilization under impulse hydraulic and organic overloadings. Reactor stability was easily achieved under intermittent operation, with breaks, after which the reactors rapidly returned to their optimal performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Accurate and precise application of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) in the quantification of environmental pollutants is a strenuous task. In this work, the electrochemical response of alendronate sodium trihydrate (ALN) was evaluated by the fabrication of two sensitive and delicate membrane electrodes, viz. polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. A linear response was obtained at concentrations from 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-2) M for both electrodes. A Nernstian slope of 29 mV/decade over a pH range of 8-11 for the PVC and GC membrane electrodes was obtained. All assay settings were carefully adjusted to obtain the best electrochemical response. The proposed technique was effectively applied for the quantification of ALN in pure form and wastewater samples, acquired from manufacturing industries. The proposed electrodes were effectively used for the determination of ALN in real wastewater samples without any prior treatment. The current findings guarantee the applicability of the fabricated ISEs for the environmental monitoring of ALN.

ID PRETREATMENT; REMOVAL
AB Pharmaceutical wastewater generated by an antibiotics (penicillin) company was treated by aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). At a low organic loading rate of 0.22 kg-COD m(-3) d(-1), both types of reactors were capable of treating the wastewater such that the treated effluent met the discharge regulation except for the total dissolved solids. However, when the loading rate was increased to 2.92 kg-COD m(-3) d(-1), foaming issues resulted in unstable performance. Overall, the MBRs achieved better solid removal but the SBRs performed better in regards to the degradation of aromatic compounds, as determined by UV absorbance (UVA). Finally, ozonation was applied on two different streams and showed promise on the strong stream - that corresponds to the formulation effluent and contains most of the biorefractory compounds. Ozonation successfully reduced the UVA, lowered the pH and increased the biochemical oxygen demand : chemical oxygen demand (BOD5 : COD) ratio of the strong stream. However, it was less efficient on the effluent having undergone pre-treatment by a biofilter due to a lack of selectivity towards refractory compounds.

AB Two antibacterials, amoxicillin trihydrate and cefuroxime axetil spiked into wastewater were completely removed by sequential wastewater treatment plant's membranes, which included activated sludge, ultrafiltration (hollow fibre and spiral wound membranes with 100 and 20 kDa cut-offs), activated carbon column and reverse osmosis. Adsorption isotherms in synthetic water which employed activated carbon and micelle-clay complex (octadecyltrimethylammonium-montmorillonite) as adsorbents fitted the Langmuir equation. Q(max) of 100 and 90.9 mg g(-1), and K values of 0.158 and 0.229 L mg(-1) were obtained for amoxicillin trihydrate using activated carbon and micelle-clay complex, respectively. Filtration of antibacterials in the ppm range, which yielded variable degrees of removal depending on the volumes passed and flow rates, was simulated and capacities for the ppb range were estimated. Stability study in pure water and wastewater revealed that amoxicillin was totally stable for one month when kept at 37 degrees C, whereas cefuroxime axetil underwent slow hydrolysis to cefuroxime.

AB In this study, photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide was modified by doping with silver metal. This was done by simple preparation procedure at room temperature. Different preparation conditions were studied and their effects on photocatalytic activity were investigated. The obtained nanopowders were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), specific surface area measurement, UV-Visible absorption, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples under simulated sunlight were evaluated with respect to their efficiencies for the degradation of five pharmaceutical compounds commonly present in hospital wastewater. Prepared samples showed very high efficiency for photodegradation of the studied pharmaceutical compounds. Maximum photodegradation rate of the simulated hospital wastewater was obtained using 1000 ppm of the material with 0.1% Ag/TiO2 (weight ratio) calcined at 300 degrees C and pH 5. However, the best pH of the degradation of each pharmaceutical compound varies according to the pKa. (C) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 886-894, 2014

AB Conventional and single-stage anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) was carried out in bench-scale reactors to treat chlortetracycline (CTC) wastewater. The total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency and rate for conventional ANAMMOX was 66.6 +/- 5.9% and 2.7 +/- 0.2 kg N/(m(3).d), respectively, which was 58.6 +/- 3.8% and 1.2 +/- 0.1 kg N/(m(3).d) for single-stage ANAMMOX. Single-stage ANAMMOX showed higher tolerance to CTC than conventional ANAMMOX. The nitrogen removal of conventional and single-stage ANAMMOX began to deteriorate when CTC was added, to 40 and 80 mg/L, respectively, with the former totally inhibited at 120 mg/L CTC and the latter at 140 mg/L CTC. TN removal rates were recovered to 1.2 and 0.7 kg N/(m(3).d), respectively, when CTC concentration was reduced to 20 mg/L for 8 days. This study implied that ANAMMOX could be efficiently used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater, with single-stage implementation being more stable under antibiotic pressure.

AB In this study a recently built NF/RO pilot unit for removal of emerging contaminants from a plant producing veterinary pharmaceuticals was tested. A wastewater stream of the plant, containing residuals of antibiotics and other organics was treated by three different types of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration membranes: XLE, NF90 and H L. Target compounds selected for this study included three different classes of antibiotics: sulphonamides, diaminopyrimidine and fluoroquinolone. A developed chromatographic method for determination of pharmaceuticals in a complex wastewater was applied. The method involved a sample pretreatment by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analytical determination by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with DAD detectors. The results showed the complete removal of all the antibiotics by the typical RO XLE membrane and by the tight nanofiltration membrane NF90. Only the loose nanofiltration membrane element HL incompletely rejected the smaller sulphonamide molecules. The satisfactory rejection of other solutes from a complex wastewater stream was also obtained.

AB The removal of seven pharmaceuticals and two fragrances in the biological units of various full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants was studied. The observed removal of pharmaceuticals was mainly due to biological transformation and varied from insignificant (< 10%, carbamazepine) to > 90% (ibuprofen). However, no quantitative relationship between structure and activity can be set up for the biological transformation. Overall, it can be concluded that for compounds showing a sorption coefficient (K-d) of below 300 L kg(-1), sorption onto secondary sludge is not relevant and their transformation can consequently be assessed simply by comparing influent and effluent concentrations. The two fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) studied were mainly removed by sorption onto sludge. For the compounds studied, comparable transformation and sorption was seen for different reactor types (conventional activated sludge, membrane bioreactor and fixed bed reactor) as well as for sludge ages between 10 and 60-80 days and temperatures between 12 degrees C and 21 degrees C. However, some significant variations in the observed removal currently lack an explanation. The observed incoming daily load of iopromide and roxithromycin in medium-sized municipal wastewater treatment plants (up to 80,000 population equivalents) is generated by only a small number of patients: the consequences for representative 24 h composite sampling are discussed. Generally, the paper presents a method for setting up mass balances for micropollutants over entire wastewater treatment plants, including an estimation of the accuracy of the quantified fate (i.e. removal by sorption and biological transformation).

AB Twenty-four pharmaceuticals were measured in wastewater from 12 municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs), four livestock WWTPs (L-WWTPs), four hospital WWTPs (H-WWTPs) and four pharmaceutical manufacture WWTPs (P-WWTPs). The total concentration of pharmaceuticals in the influent samples was highest in the L-WWTPs followed by the P-WWTPs, H-WWTPs and M-WWTPs. The effluents had different patterns of pharmaceuticals than their corresponding influents because of the different fate of each compound in the WWTPs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most dominant in the influents from the M-WWTPs and P-WWTPs, while antibiotics were dominantly detected in the L-WWTP. In the H-WWTP influents, NSAIDs, caffeine and carbamazepine were dominant. In the P-WWTPs, the distribution of pharmaceuticals in the effluents varied with sampling sites and periods. The M-WWTP influents had the highest daily loads, while the effluents showed somewhat similar levels in all source types. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The direct discharge of untreated wastewater has been identified as an important source of environmental contamination by active pharmaceutical ingredients and other 'down-the-drain' chemicals in developing countries. R necessitates the development of an environmental risk assessment approach for the resulting impact zone. This study was designed lo investigate the impact of low level of dilution (<10) on the natural attenuation processes of distribution and degradation within the impact zone. Dilution of the untreated wastewater resulted in increased desorption and corresponding environmental concentrations. The presence/absence of the microbial population in the batches affected the degree of sorption depending on the compound charge (i.e. positive or negative), highlighting an experimental technical bias. The degradation half-lives of acebutolol and diclofenac increased with increasing dilution and resulted in higher environmental persistence. The modelling of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) allowed an estimate of the temporal end boundary of the impact zone to be predicted as 24 h. Therefore, it was concluded that most of the investigated compounds would persist beyond the end of the impact zone as defined by the return to environmental BOD concentrations. It is proposed that, within environmental risk assessment protocols, the impact zone should be considered as a semi-natural wastewater treatment area in such a way to allow the estimate of environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals beyond its end.

AB Tertiary wastewater treatment plant effluent before and after zonation (0.6-1.1 g O-3/g DOC) was tested for aquatic ecotoxicity in a battery of standardised microbioassays with green algae, daphnids, and zebrafish eggs. In addition, unconjugated estrogen and 17 beta-hydroxyandrogen immunoreactive substances were quantified by means of enzyme immunoassays, and endocrine effects were analysed in a 21-day fish screening assay with adult male and female medaka (Oryzias latipes). Ozonation decreased estrogen-immunoreactivity by 97.7 +/- 1.2% and, to a lesser extent, androgen-immunoreactivity by 56.3 +/- 16.5%. None of the short-term exposure ecotoxicity tests revealed any adverse effects of the tertiary effluent, neither before nor after the ozonation step. Similarly in the fish screening assay, reproductive fitness parameters showed no effects attributed to micropollutants, and no detrimental effects of the effluents were observed. Based on the presented screening, zonation effectively reduced steroid hormone levels in the wastewater treatment plant effluent without increasing the effluent's ecotoxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of an oxidative pre-treatment with ozone on the removal of Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge has been investigated. Besides, the digested sludge characteristics in terms of pathogens content, dewatering properties, heavy metals content and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) were determined. During ozonation (20 mg O-3/g TSS), about 8% of volatile solids (VS) and 60% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) were solubilized. However, no mineralization was observed. The elimination of VS and total COD during anaerobic digestion were not affected by ozone treatment with efficiencies ranging from 60% to 65%. All PPCPs considered were removed during anaerobic treatment of sludge, with efficiencies ranging from 20% to 99%. No significant influence of ozone pre-treatment was observed on PPCPs elimination except for carbamazepine. Pathogens, heavy metals and LAS contents after conventional and pre-ozonation treatment of sewage sludge were below the legal requirements. However, the dewatering properties of sludge were deteriorated when the ozone pre-treatment was applied. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical residues in waste water from the largest sewage treatment plant (SIP) in Northern Taiwan and in seawater around the effluent discharged area were determined. An environmental risk assessment for the marine environment was conducted based on the environment risk quotient (ERQ). The concentrations of the analyzed compounds in SIP influent and effluent were generally higher than those found in coastal seawater. Relatively higher values were found at the estuarine mouth and the discharged area, suggesting that the SIP effluent is a point source. The removal efficiency and half life of the analyzed compounds were 6.3-46.8% and 3-18 days, respectively. The ERQ value theoretical calculation was generally greater than 1. However, when the measured concentrations replaced the predicated concentrations, the ERQ values were considerably lower than 1. Therefore, our results call for a re-evaluation of the risks posed by pharmaceuticals to coastal marine ecosystems in Northern Taiwan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A double membrane system combining a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a nanofiltration (NF) membrane at the pilot scale was tested to treat real antibiotic wastewater at a pharmaceutical company in Wuxi (China). The water yield of the pilot system reached over 92 +/- 5.6% through recycling the NF concentrate to the MBR tank. Results showed that the pilot scale system operated in good conditions throughout the entire experiment period and obtained excellent water quality in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon were stable at 35 and 5.7 mg/L, respectively. The antibiotic removal rates of both spiramycin (SPM) and new spiramycin in wastewater were over 95%. Organics analysis results showed that the main organics in the biological effluent were proteins, soluble microbial by-product-like, fulvic acid-like and humic-like substances. These organics could be perfectly rejected by the NF membrane. Most of the organics could be removed through recycling NF concentrate to the MBR tank and only a small part was discharged with NF concentrate and permeate.

AB The production of personal hygiene and body products generates wastewater with a high load of surfactants, a high chemical oxygen demand (COD), and abundant oils and greases. Aluminum sulfate (AS) and two solutions of natural coagulant from Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds prepared with a 1M NaCl solution and 1.5M NaCl solution were used. Aluminum sulfate, Moringa oleifera Lam. in 1M NaCl, and Moringa oleifera Lam. in 1.5M NaCl solutions reduced turbidity at rates 94.48%, 98.07%, and 97.87%; reduced COD at rates 46.36%, 49.15%, and 42.7%; and reduced oil and grease at rates 98.72%, 78.65%, and 97.41%, respectively. Mutagenicity tests with guppies showed a lower toxicity of Moringa oleifera Lam. extract compared with aluminum sulfate. This work shows that Moringa oleifera Lam. extract has high potential for use as an alternative to aluminum sulfate; therefore, this study will contribute to proposals for the sustainable treatment of effluents from the cosmetic industry.

AB The objective of this study was to identify transformation products (TPs) of citalopram (CIT), an antidepressant drug, in laboratory experiments. Moreover, toxicity predictions and analyzes in wastewater samples were performed. For the formation of TPs, raw water was used for the processes of hydrolysis; photodegradation under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and chlorination. The toxicities were predicted by computational toxicity assessment. The TPs were identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) in broadband collision induced dissociation (bbCID) acquisition mode and product ion scan mode (MS/MS). The probable structures of the TPs under study were established based on accurate mass, fragmentations observed in the MS spectra and prediction tools software. The experiments resulted in seventeen possible identified TPs and their stability and formation was monitored over time in the experiments. Two of these TPs were identified in wastewater samples It was also observed that most of TPs formed were either less toxic then CIT or had a similar toxicity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Endoxifen is an effective metabolite of a common chemotherapy agent, tamoxifen. Endoxifen, which is toxic to aquatic animals, has been detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This research investigates ultraviolet (UV) radiation (253.7 nm) application to degrade (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water and wastewater and phototransformation by-products (PBPs) and their toxicity. The effects of light intensity, pH and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen on the photodegradation rate were examined. Endoxifen in water was eliminated >= 99.1% after 35 s of irradiation (light dose of 598.5 mJ cm(-2)). Light intensity and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen exhibited positive trends with the photodegradation rates while pH had no effect. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water resulted in three PBPs. Toxicity assessments through modeling of the identified PBPs suggest higher toxicity than the parent compounds. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in wastewater at light doses used for disinfection in WWTPs (16, 30 and 97 mJ cm(-2)) resulted in reductions of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen from 30 to 71%. Two of the three PBPs observed in the experiments with water were detected in the wastewater experiments. Therefore, toxic compounds are potentially generated at WWTPs by UV disinfection if (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen are present in treated wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and estimated concentration of twenty illicit and therapeutic pharmaceuticals and metabolites in surface waters influenced by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge and in wastewater effluents in Nebraska were determined using Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS). Samplers were installed in rivers upstream and downstream of treated WWTP discharge at four sites and in a discharge canal at a fifth location. Based on differences in estimated concentrations determined from pharmaceuticals recovered from POCIS, WWTP effluent was found to be a significant source of pharmaceutical loading to the receiving waters. Effluents from WWTPs with trickling filters or trickling filters in parallel with activated sludge resulted in the highest observed in-stream pharmaceutical concentrations. Azithromycin, caffeine, 1,7-dimethylzanthine, carbamazepine, cotinine, DEET, diphenhydramine, and sulfamethazine were detected at all locations. Methamphetamine, an illicit pharmaceutical, was detected at all but one of the sampling locations, representing only the second report of methamphetamine detected in WWTP effluent and in streams impacted by WWTP effluent.

AB Treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are a significant source of anthropogenic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, in the aquatic environment. Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O-2 consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site. We discuss our findings in relation to exposure site water quality, concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care product pollutants, and our test species tolerance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of recalcitrant organic molecules with high amounts of chemical oxygen demand, low biodegradability, and lack of effective treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater result in environmental pollution. Batch wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) experiments have been performed to study the effect of temperature (150 degrees C-250 degrees C), oxidant coefficient (OC 0-3), and reaction time (20 minutes-60 minutes) on degradation efficiency of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater. Box-Behnken design (BBD) with response surface methodology was used to study the effect of independent parameters on total organic carbon (TOC) removal response. The optimum temperature, oxidant coefficient, and reaction time of the process were found to be 250 degrees C, OC 3, and 60 minutes, which resulted in TOC conversion of 57.96%. The obtained quadratic model has been able to predict the response with minimum deviation. The experimental modelling results conveyed that influence of process parameters followed the order: temperature > time > oxidant coefficient. To improve the mineralization efficiency, process parameters were changed to attain the near complete conversion (similar to 99%) of the pharmaceutical wastewater. The qualitative analysis also showed that only a few components of pharmaceuticals were present in the treated effluent.

AB Efficient removal techniques are urgently needed to remove organic micropollutants (OMPs) from wastewater, in order to protect water resources. In this study, laccase activity of mushroom substrate colonized by Pleurotus ostreatus was evaluated as a novel wastewater treatment method for removal of OMPs, including diclofenac, bicalutamide, lamotrigine, and metformin at environmentally relevant concentrations. Laccase activity of the colonized mushroom substrate was found to be highest, 0.8 enzyme activity (U)/g mushroom substrate wet weight, immediately before initiation of fruiting body formation. The selected OMPs were treated for 5 min with suspensions of mushroom substrate with laccase activity of approximately 50 U/L. Removal of all OMPs was significant, with the highest removal for diclofenac of 90% compared with a control with uncolonized mushroom substrate. To our knowledge, direct use of colonized mushroom substrate in removing diclofenac from water has not been reported previously. Removal efficiency of bicalutamide, lamotrigine, and metformin was 43%, 73%, and 59%, respectively. This demonstrates potential for using mushroom substrate colonized by P. ostreatus for removal of OMPs from wastewater.

AB The aim of our work was to determine the extent of inhibition of oxygen consumption by activated sludge for carbonaceous and ammonium oxidation (ISO 8192 2007) for various wastewaters. We have selected several types of wastewaters different in their origin and composition: pharmaceutical wastewater, tannery wastewater and municipal landfill leachate. To confirm results of toxicity testing, additional ready biodegradability assessment test with measurement of oxygen consumption was accomplished to indicate the impact of effluents to nitrification process. Pharmaceutical wastewater was toxic to activated sludge, but it inhibited heterotrophic microorganisms much more than nitrifying ones. Biodegradability testing confirmed low impact to nitrification by high, non-suppressed oxygen consumption for nitrification process. Tannery effluent inhibited nitrification significantly (180 min EC50 was 57 vol.%), but it did not affect heterotrophic microorganisms. Landfill leachate was very toxic to heterotrophic microorganisms (180 min EC50 was 3 vol.%), while it inhibited nitrification less (180 min EC50 was 24 vol.%). Presented research confirmed that the investigated experimental method is a reliable one for detection of occurrence of substances inhibiting nitrification in different industrial effluents. With regular monitoring of inhibitory impact biological treatment process upsets could be avoided and treatment optimised.

AB The present study aimed towards the utilization of hybrid approaches for the effective treatment of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The focus was to treat pharmaceutical wastewater with low (LSW) and high organic strength (HSW), which was collected from the effluent treatment plant of the representative bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing unit. The hybrid approach included coagulation treatment, biological treatment and gamma irradiation which were employed individually and in sequence to determine the most appropriate treatment sequence for effective remediation of real pharmaceutical wastewater. To compare process performance, gamma-irradiation was employed as pre-treatment and post-treatment stage to biological treatment. To achieve the enhanced removal efficiency using gamma irradiation treatment, oxidant like H2O2 and persulfate ions S2O82- were used and optimized for LSW and HSW. Results indicated that use of H2O2 lead to enhanced COD and TOC removal efficiency when compared to S2O82-. The sequential approach of coagulation, gamma irradiation and biological treatment accounts for the synergistic degradation and detoxification of recalcitrant pharmaceutical wastewaters, and lead to overall 92.7% +/- 2.3% and 90.2% +/- 2.9% of COD removal of LSW and HSW, respectively. The pre-treatment using gamma-irradiation enabled effective treatment, achieving 58.7% +/- 3.2% COD and 80.4% +/- 2.1% TOC removal efficiencies for LSW; whereas 62.0% +/- 2.9% COD and 71.0% +/- 2.7% TOC removal efficiencies were achieved for HSW. Cytotoxicity assessment and cost analysis of the treatment process were examined and analyzed.

AB Release of domestic sewage leads to accumulation of xenoestrogens in holding waters, especially in closed or semi-enclosed waters such as lakes. In the study, the occurrence, distribution, estrogenic activity and risk of eight xenoestreogens were evaluated in Lake Donghu, China. Nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and bisphenol A (BPA) were identified as the main xenoestrogens ranging from tens of ng L-1 (in the surface water) or ng g(-1) dw (in the suspended particles and sediment) to tens of mu g L-1 or mu g g(-)1 dw. The sum of 178-estradiol equivalents (Sigma EEQs) ranged from 0.32 to 45.02 ng L-1 in the surface water, 0.53 to 71.86 ng g(-1) dw in the suspended particles, and 0.09 to 24.73 ng g(-1) dw in the sediment. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was determined as the main contributor to Sigma EEQs followed by NP. The risk assessment showed a higher risk in the surface water than in the suspended particles and sediment in such domestic sewage-holding lake. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrosorption is a novel desalination technique that has many advantages in the treatment of sewage. However, commercially available activated carbon electrodes for electrosorption commonly have low microporosity, poor moulding performance, and low adsorption and regeneration efficiency. Here, we evaluated a novel adsorbent material, activated carbon fibre felt (ACFF), for electrosorption of Chromium ions (Cr6+) in sewage treatment. The ACFF was modified with 20% nitric acid and its modified structure was characterized. The modified ACFF was used as an adsorbing electrode to investigate its desalination effect by electrosorption. Results showed that compared with those of unmodified ACFF, the modified ACFF had more carbonyl and carboxyl groups and the specific surface area, average pore size and micropore volume of the modified ACFF also improved by 32.2%, 25% and 23.1%, respectively. The kinetics of Cr6+ adsorption conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, and the adsorption isotherm conformed to the Langmuir model. In addition, the regeneration rate of the modified ACFF electrode was more than 94%. In conclusion, the modified ACFF exhibits excellent electrosorption and regeneration performance for Cr6+ removal from water and thus is of great value for promotion in sewage treatment.

AB Sewage sludge is an important amendment that enriches soils with organic matter and provides plants with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. However, knowledge on the fate and effects of organic pollutants present in the sludge on soil organismsis limited. In the present study, the uptake of triclosan, galaxolide, and tonalide in the earthworm Dendrobaena veneta was measured 1 wk after amendment of agricultural soil with sewage sludge, while elimination kinetics were assessed over a 21-d period after transferring worms to clean soil. After 1-wk exposure, earthworms had accumulated 2.6 +/- 0.6 mu g g(-1) galaxolide, 0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g g(-1) tonalide, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1) triclosan. Both synthetic musks were efficiently excreted and below the limit of quantification after 3 and 14 d of depuration for tonalide and galaxolide, respectively. Triclosan concentrations, on the other hand, did not decrease significantly over the depuration period, which may lead to the transfer of triclosan in the food web. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB We report the results of a nationwide survey of commonly used human and veterinary antibiotics (7 sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and 4 macrolides) in 37 Japanese rivers. Concentrations of the sum of the 12 target antibiotics ranged from undetectable to 626 ng/L, with a median of 7.3 ng/L for the 37 rivers. Antibiotics concentrations were higher in urban rivers than in rural rivers and were correlated with those of molecular markers of sewage (crotamiton and carbamazepine). Macrolides were dominant over sulfonamides in urban rivers. Sulfonamides, especially sulfamethazine (used in animals), were dominant in a few rivers in whose catchment animal husbandry is active. However, these signals of veterinary antibiotics were overwhelmed by those of human antibiotics in lower reaches of most rivers. The analysis of the antibiotics in all 88 samples showed that the target antibiotics in Japanese rivers are derived mainly from urban sewage, even though larger amounts of antibiotics are used in livestock. Most of the livestock waste-derived antibiotics are unlikely to be readily discharged to surface waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic wastes treated, used on agricultural land, can replace inorganic fertilizers, due to physical and chemical properties that improve soil and crop quality on long-term. In this study, was used biochar produced from sewage sludge, compost obtained from cattle manure, and mixtures made from biochar-compost in different concentration, at 5 t/ha and 30 t/ha, application rates. The aim of the study is to determine the influence of this organic wastes on the heavy metals bioavailability in greenhouse conditions and on Folsomia candida and Eisenia Andrei, used as test organisms under laboratory conditions. Compared to control variants, the use of biochar mixed with compost in different concentration at 5 t/ha and 30 t/ha, application rates, in a greenhouse experiment did not significantly affect the concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb). Reproduction of collembolans has not been influenced by increasing application rate of the mixtures, and by concentrations of biochar or compost. The earthworms recorded weight losses, only in the experimental treatments with sewage sludge biochar used in different concentrations, at both application rates.

AB The present study describes the synthesis of silica and magnetic nanoparticle-decorated graphene oxide (GO-MNPs-SiO2) and its application as an adsorbent for the removal of naproxen from wastewater. Nanocomposite was characterized utilizing FT-IR spectroscopy, FESEM microscopy, EDX and XPS spectroscopy. Under the optimum conditions, a high adsorption capacity (31 mg g(-1)) was obtained toward naproxen at pH 5. The adsorption process was evaluated using isotherms; the Freundlich isotherm suggested a multilayer adsorption pattern for naproxen. Free energy confirmed a physisorption mechanism between naproxen and adsorbent. Lastly, the field application was performed in wastewater which obtained high removal efficiency percentages (83-94%).

AB Forest-water reuse (FWR) systems treat municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters via land application to forest soils. Previous studies have shown that both large-scale conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and FWR systems do not completely remove many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) before release of treated wastewater. To better characterize CECs and potential for increased implementation of FWR systems, FWR systems need to be directly compared to conventional WWTPs. In this study, both a quantitative, targeted analysis and a nontargeted analysis were utilized to better understand how CECs release to waterways from an FWR system compared to a conventional treatment system. Quantitatively, greater concentrations and total mass load of CECs was exhibited downstream of the conventional WWTP compared to the FWR. Average summed concentrations of 33 targeted CECs downstream of the conventional system were similar to 1000 ng/L and downstream of the FWR were similar to 30 ng/L. From a nontargeted chemical standpoint, more tentatively identified chemicals were present, and at a greater relative abundance, downstream of the conventional system as well. Frequently occurring contaminants included phthalates, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. These data indicate that FWR systems represent a sustainable wastewater treatment alternative and that emerging contaminant release to waterways was lower at a FWR system than a conventional WWTP.

AB Conventional onsite wastewater treatment system design relies on a septic tank and soil treatment unit (STU) for treatment of wastewater and integration of the final effluent into the environment. Organic water contaminants (OWCs), chemicals found in pharmaceutical drugs, detergents, surfactants, and other personal care and cleaning products, have been observed in septic tank effluent and the environment. Sorption of OWC mass to soil is a key mechanism in the removal and retardation of many of these chemicals in effluent as it travels through an STU. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the fraction of organic carbon of soil and the equilibrium sorption partitioning coefficient of a selected group of relevant and diverse OWCs. A secondary goal is to evaluate current methods of modeling the sorption of selected OWCs in soil. Five point Freundlich isotherms were constructed from equilibrium sorption batch tests for target OWCs with four different soils. For soils with organic carbon fraction between 0.021 and 0.054, K-d values were calculated between 60 and 185 for 4-nonylphenol, 75 to 260 for triclosan, 115 to 270 for bisphenol-A, 3 to 255 for 17 beta-estradiol, 40 to 55 for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, and 28 to 70 for estrone. An empirically derived, direct relationship between f(oc) and K-d may be a useful approach to estimating sorption for a soil based on organic carbon content.

AB Degradation and mineralization of ibuprofen (IBU) were investigated using Ultraviolet (UV) Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in TiO2 photocatalysis. Samples of ultrapure water (UP) and a secondary treated effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), both spiked with IBU, as well as a highly concentrated IBU (230 mg L-1) pharmaceutical industry wastewater (PIWW), were tested in the TiO2/UV-LED system. Three operating parameters, namely, pH, catalyst load and number of LEDs were optimized. The process efficiency was evaluated in terms of IBU removal using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Additionally, the mineralization was investigated by determining the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content. The chemical structures of transformation products were proposed based on the data obtained using liquid chromatography with a high resolution mass spectrometer ion trap/time-of-flight (LC-MS-IT-TOF). A possible pathway of IBU degradation was accordingly suggested. Bioassays were performed using the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri to evaluate the potential acute toxicity of original and treated wastewaters. TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis was efficient to remove IBU from UP and from PIWW, and less efficient in treating the wastewater from the municipal WWTP. The acute toxicity decreased by ca. 40% after treatment, regardless of the studied matrix.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is a complicated process due to the presence of various kinds of toxic chemicals and antibiotics that are harmful to any living organisms. In this study we employed a pilot-scale net-like rotating biological contactor (NRBC) with three compartments and total volume of 78.75 L to eliminate high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from a synthetic wastewater. In this system, 16 plastic discs in each compartment were fixed on a horizontal shaft, rotating with constant speed (4 rpm). Activated sludge collected from a local hospital wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum and the system was working in batch condition in order to develop adapted living organisms as biofilm on the rotation discs. Then the NRBC was successfully operated at continuous mode for 10 months at various organic loading rates (OLR) (0 to 21.3 gCOD/L.d), hydraulic retention times (HRT) (12 to 72 h), and concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (5 to 120 mg/L). It was found that by increasing in OLR and HRT, SMX removal efficiency was increased. Also, the obtained results indicated that increasing COD concentration had a positive impact on SMX removal efficiency, which was most probably due to the utilization of SMX as a nitrogen source. Finally, it was revealed that most SMX and organic matter removal occurred in the first compartment of the NRBC, and antibiotic concentration was negligible in the outlet stream.

AB Recently, pharmaceutical compounds have been identified as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC) in wastewater due to the potential hazards to human bodies, and various methods are being developed to remove CEC from wastewater and water bodies. This research reports conversion of spent tea leaves (STL) to activated carbon (AC) for removal of acetaminophen (paracetamol) from simulated wastewater. STL-AC prepared via phosphoric acid activation (STL-ACH) showed the highest adsorption performance towards acetaminophen when compared to STL-AC activated by other chemicals. Characterizations on STL-ACH revealed that acid treatment led to dehydration and chemical reactions in the biomass precursor. The maximum removal efficiency of aspirin observed at the initial concentration of 10 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 0.5 g, pH 3 at room temperature and reaction time of 60 min. The adsorption data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model and obeyed the pseudo-second order kinetics model. The adsorption capacity of STL-ACH towards acetaminophen was found to be 59.2 mg/g. The adsorption process is exothermic, feasible and spontaneous according to the thermodynamic evaluation. This study demonstrates the feasibility to convert one common biowaste to a value-added product that removes contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) from wastewater, thus it is necessary to investigate the potential of STL-ACH in wastewater treatment application.

Triclosan concentrations were reduced by 97 to 99% by the activated sludge treatment plant. Effluent concentrations were further reduced by passage through the constructed wetland, but receiving stream concentrations were not statistically significantly different from effluent concentrations. Effluent concentrations of triclosan were seasonal with highest concentrations occurring during the summer months. The effluent-dominated receiving stream maximum concentrations during summer months were below reported algal no-observed-effect concentrations based on biomass and growth rate but exceeded concentrations reported to cause shifts in algal community structure.

AB The conditions for the treatment of high phosphorus pharmaceutical wastewater using chemical precipitation were determined to achieve high efficiency on the removal of total phosphorus (TP). The key factors affecting the TP removal efficiencies of four metal salts (FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, and CaCl2), such as molar ratio, initial wastewater pH, and reaction time, were investigated. The optimal metal mole ratios of FeCl3, AlCl3P, MgCl2, and CaCl2 for the TP removal were 1.8:1, 1.8:1, 1.6:1, and 1.6:1 in the initial pH range, respectively. The TP removal efficiencies obtained by FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, and CaCl2 were 99.8%, 98.3%, 96.9%, and 99.2% at the optimal mole ratio and pH conditions with 30min reaction time, respectively. FeCl3 and AlCl3 had better removal performance on COD, wherein the removal rates of COD by FeCl3 and AlCl3 were 38.6% and 27.6%, respectively. FeCl3 and CaCl2 were selected for the combined process of removing TP and overcoming the aforementioned problem. The final effluent quality was better than the one only used on one of the four metal salts, in which the removal rates of TP and COD were as high as 99.8% and 46.9%, respectively. The combined process with FeCl3 and CaCl2 was an effective method for the pretreatment of high phosphorus pharmaceutical wastewater to reduce the processing cost and to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TP.

AB In this study, the applicability of UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to serve as reliable surrogates to predict acute toxicity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) wastewater was investigated. The medicine residues and VFAs were identified as main components of the TCM wastewater, and their individual and joint toxicity assays were operated with luminescent bacteria. The median effective concentration (EC50) values of medicine residues and VFAs were in the range of 26.46 -165.55 mg/L and 11.45-20.58 g/L, respectively. The joint toxicity action modes of medicine residues, VFAs and medicine residues-VFAs were identified as additive, additive and synergistic respectively. UV254 and VFAs showed better correlations with acute toxicity according to the correlation analysis, compared with other conventional parameters. The regression model was a good fit for toxic unit (TU50) as a function of UV254 and VFAs according to the stepwise regression method (adjusted R-2 = 0.836). Validation of the model to the pilot-scale samples provided satisfactory prediction results in the influent and hydrolysis acidification effluent samples tests, but for EGSB effluent and final effluent samples, the model needed further optimization. Surrogates prediction using UV254 and VFAs provided a valuable and cost saving tool for rapid or on-line monitoring of acute toxicity of TCM wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bioassays are well established in the pharmaceutical industry and single compound analysis, but there is still uncertainty about their usefulness in environmental monitoring. We compared the responses of five bioassays designed to measure estrogenic activity (the yeast estrogen screen, ER-CALUX, MELN, T47D-KBluc, and E-SCREEN assays) and chemical analysis on extracts from four different water sources (groundwater, raw sewage, treated sewage, and river water). All five bioassays displayed similar trends and there was good agreement with analytical chemistry results. The data from the ER-CALUX and E-SCREEN bioassays were robust and predictable, and well-correlated with predictions from chemical analysis. The T47D-KBluc appeared likewise promising, but with a more limited sample size it was less compelling. The YES assay was less sensitive than the other assays by an order of magnitude, which resulted in a larger number of nondetects. The MELN assay was less predictable, although the possibility that this was due to laboratory-specific difficulties cannot be discounted. With standardized bioassay data analysis and consistency of operating protocols, bioanalytical tools are a promising advance in the development of a tiered approach to environmental water quality monitoring.

AB Microalgae has been utilised in various applications ranging from pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, supplements, liquid fuels as well as food source for human and animals. The upscaling of microalgae production to meet the demand for global consumption has yet to be realized as there are many factors to be considered in the upstream and downstream processing of microalgae biomass. For upstream processing, the high cultivation cost which poses a major setback can be reduced by cultivating the microalgae in wastewater sources, which are widely available and at the same time can lead to bioremediation of these waste sources. The contents of microalgae biomass from wastewater can also be used to produce the desired bioproducts. For downstream processing, the efficiency of traditional processes has long hindered the progression of microalgae to products, hence, the discovery of advanced technologies which can yield higher productivity and good quality products have been studied and upscale to a pilot scale to verify its feasibility. Separation techniques like liquid biphasic system and membrane separation are potential in achieving high yield and separation efficiency to recover valuable products from microalgae and these processes are environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The insights from cultivating microalgae in wastewater sources and the promising technologies to convert them into useful bioproducts will be beneficial to the developments of future upstream and downstream processes.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a disinfection oxidant used in many industries including wastewater treatment. beta-Lactams, a group of widely prescribed antibiotics, are frequently detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven beta-lactams (cefalexin (CFX), cefadroxil (CFR), cefapirin (CFP), cephalothin (CFT), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX) and penicillin G (PG)) toward PM were investigated to elucidate the behavior of beta-lactams during PAA oxidation processes. The reaction follows second-order kinetics and is much faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to speciation of PM. Reactivity to PAA follows the order of CFR similar to CFX > AMP similar to AMX > CFT CFP similar to PG and is related to beta-lactam's nucleophilicity. The thioether sulfur of beta-lactams is attacked by PAA to generate sulfoxide products. Presence of the phenylglycinyl amino group on beta-lactams can significantly influence electron distribution and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) location and energy in ways that enhance the reactivity to PM. Reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to accurately model the decay of beta-lactams by PM in surface water matrix and only slightly overestimate the decay in wastewater matrix. Results of this study indicate that the oxidative transformation of beta-lactams by PM can be expected under appropriate wastewater treatment conditions. 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are two commonly used personal care products. They may enter into aquatic environments after consumption and pose potential risks to aquatic organisms. We investigated the occurrence and fate of TCS and TCC in five large rivers (the Liao River, Hai River, Yellow River, Zhujiang River and Dongjiang River) in China, and compared the monitoring data with the predicted results from Level III fugacity modeling. TCS and TCC were detected in the five large rivers with the detection frequencies of 100% or close to 100% in surface water and sediments of almost every river. TCS and TCC were found at concentrations of up to 478 ng/L and 338 ng/L in surface water, and up to 1329 ng/g and 2723 ng/g in sediments. Cluster analysis indicated that the sites with higher concentrations were usually located in or near urban area. Meanwhile, principal component analysis also suggested that the mass inventories of TCS and TCC in water and sediment were significantly influenced by the factors such as the total or untreated urban domestic sewage discharge at river basin scale. The concentrations and mass inventories from the fugacity modeling were found at the same order of magnitude with the measured values, suggesting that the fugacity modeling can provide a useful tool for evaluating the fate of TCS and TCC in riverine environments. Both monitoring and modeling results indicated that the majority of mass inventories of TCS and TCC were stored into sediment, which could be a potential pollution source for river water. The wide presence of TCS and TCC in these large rivers of China implies that better controlling of urban domestic sewage discharge is needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics are commonly used in swine feed to treat and prevent disease, as well as to promote growth. Antibiotics released into the environment via wastewater could accelerate the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria and resistance genes in the surrounding environment. In this study, we quantified the occurrence of sulfonamides, sulfonamide-resistant microorganisms and resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm in northern Taiwan and its surrounding natural water bodies and soils. Sulfonamide levels were similar in the receiving downstream and upstream river water. However, the prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, as analyzed by cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, was significantly greater in the downstream compared to the upstream river water samples. Barcoded-pyrosequencing revealed a highly diverse bacterial community structure in each sample. However, the sequence identity of the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in the wastewater and downstream environment samples was nearly identical (99-100%). The sul1 gene, which is genetically linked to class 1 integrons, was dominant in the downstream water bodies and soils. In conclusion, the increased prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm, independent of the persistent presence of sulfonamides, could be a potential source of resistant gene pools in the surrounding environment.

AB The seasonal occurrence of organic contaminants, many of which are potential endocrine disruptors, entering the Potomac River, USA, watershed was investigated using a two-pronged approach during the fall of 2005 and spring of 2006. Passive samplers (semipermeable membrane device and polar organic chemical integrative sampler [POCIS]) were deployed in tandem at sites above and below wastewater treatment plant discharges within the watershed. Analysis of the samplers resulted in detection of 84 of 138 targeted chemicals. The agricultural pesticides atrazine and metolachlor had the greatest seasonal changes in water concentrations, with a 3.1- to 91-fold increase in the spring compared with the level in the previous fall. Coinciding with the elevated concentrations of atrazine in the spring were increasing concentrations of the atrazine degradation products desethylatrazine and desisopropylatrazine in the fall following spring and summer application of the parent compound. Other targeted chemicals (organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic wastewater chemicals) did not indicate seasonal changes in occurrence or concentration; however, the overall concentrations and number of chemicals present were greater at the sites downstream of wastewater treatment plant discharges. Several fragrances and flame retardants were identified in these downstream sites, which are characteristic of wastewater effluent and human activities. The bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen in vitro assay of the POCIS extracts indicated the presence of chemicals that were capable of producing an estrogenic response at all sampling sites.

AB Phenolic compounds are mixtures of phenol derivatives which are produced from several industries including biocides, pharmaceuticals and coal production. Phenolics are considered the major contaminants in industrialized wastewater. Therefore, treatment of wastewater polluted by phenolics is mandatory previously to discharge in order to protect the environment. Among the numerous procedures reported for remediation of industrial wastewater from phenolics; adsorption technology was the best method from the effectiveness and economical point of view. In this study, three agricultural wastes produced in huge amounts were evaluated in remediation of wastewater contaminated by 2-chlorophenol. The studied agricultural wastes were water hyacinth, palm leaf, and banana peel. The adsorption process parameters were determined including temperature, pH, amount of adsorbents, concentration of pollutant, and treatment time. The process followed Freundlich adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Boyd model showed that the adsorption mechanism of chlorophenol on the surface of the different adsorbents was occurred via film diffusion mechanism. The obtained adsorption capacities at the equilibrium conditions were 288.1, 290.3, and 388.9 mg/g for water hyacinth, palm leaf, and banana peel, respectively. The spectroscopic evaluation showed the physical interaction between the chlorophenol molecules and the different functional groups on the studied adsorbents. Banana peel showed the highest adsorption efficiency, which was related to the abundance and types of the bioactive compounds in its chemical structure.

AB Information is limited regarding Sources, distribution, environmental behavior, and fate of prescribed and illicit drugs. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can be one of the sources of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP) into streams, rivers and lakes. The objective of this study was to determine the contamination profiles and mass loadings of urobilin (a chemical marker of human waste), macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin), and two drugs of abuse (methamphetamine and ecstasy), from a small (<19 mega liters day(-1), equivalent to <5 million gallons per day) wastewater treatment plant in southwestern Kentucky. The concentrations of azithromycin, clarithromycin, methamphetamine and ecstasy in wastewater samples varied widely, ranging from non-detects to 300 ng L-1. Among the macrolide antibiotics analyzed, azithromycin was consistently detected in influent and effluent samples. in general, influent samples contained relatively higher concentrations of the analytes than the effluents. Based on the daily flow rates and an average concentration of 17.5 ng L-1 in the effluent, the estimated discharge of azithromycin was 200 mg day(-1) (range 63-400 mg day(-1)). Removal efficiency of the detected analytes from this WWTP were in the following order: Urobilin > nnethamphetamine > azithromycin with percentages of removal of 99.9%, 54.5% and 47%, respectively, indicating that the azithromycin and methamphetamine are relatively more recalcitrant than others and have potential for entering receiving waters.

The method was suitable for the analysis of the selected illicit drugs amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, and methamphetamine, the pharmaceuticals atenolol, bendroflumethiazide, carbamazepine, citalopram, diclofenac, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and salbutamol, and the bactericides triclosan and triclocarban in sewage sludge and freshwater sediment. The method provided an overall recovery of between 56 and 128%, RSDs of between 2 and 19% and LODs of between 1 and 50 ng g(-1). Using the methodology the human pharmaceuticals atenolol, carbamazepine and citalopram and the bactericides triclosan and triclocarban were detected in Scottish sewage sludge. The illicit drugs cocaine, its metabolite benzoylecgonine, amphetamine and methamphetamine were not detected in any of the samples analysed. Triclosan and triclocarban were present at the highest concentrations with triclocarban detected in all but one sample and showing a pattern of co-occurrence in both sludge and sediment samples.

AB Although Ag-containing semiconductors as effective photocatalysts have attracted significant concern because of the unique photosensitivity, their visible-light photocatalytic activities are still not satisfactory, and usually suffer from photocorrosion. In this study, cubic-like reduced graphene oxide/AgIn5S8 (rGO/AIS) nanocomposites were fabricated via a mild solvothermal method, and employed to photodegrade nitrophenols (2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol) and dispose of real pharmaceutical wastewater under visible-light illumination. All the rGO/AIS nanocomposites exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than that of pure AIS, and the photocatalytic activities of rGO/AIS is related with different rGO content. The optimized 1% rGO/AIS displayed the highest photocatalytic activities with 91% 4NP removal and 93.2% 2NP removal efficiency in 120 min, which can be ascribed to the largest specific surface area, enhanced light absorption, as well as the most efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Most importantly, H2O2 aided photocatalysis of 1% rGO/AIS can effectively deal with real pharmaceutical industry wastewater with 89% COD removal. Additionally, 1% rGO/AIS exhibits excellent reusability in four cycles due to its anti-photocorrosion ability, stable crystal structure, surface composition and chemical valence state. The above results open up new horizons for improving the photocatalytic activity and stability of AIS, providing a green method for processing actual pharmaceutical wastewater references.

AB The antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP), a micropollutant found at mu g/L levels in raw wastewater, was investigated with regard to its (bio)transformation during biological wastewater treatment. A pilot-scale, nitrifying/denitrifying Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) fed with municipal wastewater was monitored for TMP removal during a 16-month monitoring study. Laboratory-scaled bioreactors spiked with TMP were applied to identify the transformation products (TPs). In total, six TPs could be identified from TMP. However, the TP formation was influenced by the spike concentration. At an initial concentration of 500 mu g/LTMP, only two TPs were found, whereas at 5 mu g/L a completely different transformation pathway led to four further TPs. At low concentrations, TMP was demethylated forming 4-desmethyl-TMP, which was then quickly hydroxylated, oxidized and cleaved forming 2,4-diaminopyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (DAPC) via two intermediate TPs. DAPC was detected in the SBR effluent in a 3-d composite sample with 61 ng/L, which accounts for 52% of the attenuated TMP. The primary degradation at low spiking levels was best modelled by a pseudo-first order kinetic. Considering the SBR, the model predicted a TMP removal of 88-94% for the reactor, consistent with a monitoring campaign exhibiting an average removal of >83%. Both the TP formation profiles and kinetic modelling indicated that only the results from the bioreactor tests at low spike concentrations were representative of the transformation in the SBR.

AB This study assessed the applicability of fixed bed bioreactors in two configurations - anaerobic structured bed reactor (ASBR) and anaerobic packed bed reactor (APBR) - in the removal of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Cipro-floxacin (CIP), two antibiotics frequently detected in sanitary sewage. The problem of these pharmaceuticals as emerging contaminants in conventional sewage treatment systems is mainly because they encourage the development and spread of resistance genes in bacteria. Both reactors had similar performances, and the antibiotics were highly removed - APBR: 85 +/- 10% for SMX and 81 +/- 16% for CIP; ASBR: 83 +/- 12% for SMX and 81 +/- 15% for CIP. The ASBR showed to be potentially more feasible in operating and economic terms compared to the APBR, as the former presents a smaller amount of support material in the bed. SMX was completely biotransformed, while the influence of the sorption mechanism was observed for CIP, as its presence was detected sorbed onto biomass throughout the reaction bed of the reactors, with a partition coefficient (log K D ) of around 2.8 L.kg(-l) TSS. The degradation kinetics of the pharmaceuticals were fitted using a first-order kinetic model, whereby the reactors behaved as plug flow ones, indicating the possibility of optimizing the operation for a hydraulic retention time of 6 h. The removal kinetics was more favorable for CIP (higher apparent constant kinetic- K-CIP(app)>K-SMX(app). since its biodegradation is linked to the biomass, which is more concentrated in the bed bottom layer. The experimental results showed the potential of anaerobic fixed bed reactors in removing environmentally relevant concentrations of SMX and CIP found in sewage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ten acidic and two neutral pharmaceuticals were detected in the effluents of eight sewage treatment plants (STPs) from across Atlantic Canada. Concentrations varied between nondetectable and 35 mu g/L. The analgesic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and naproxen were predominant. Carbamazepine, a neutral compound used as an antiepileptic drug, was observed consistently at a median concentration of 79 ng/L. Acetaminophen was found in the effluents of the three largest mechanical STPs at a median concentration of 1.9 mu g/L, but not in the lagoon treatment systems. The substantially longer hydraulic retention times may have contributed to more effective removal of acetaminophen in the lagoon treatment systems. Drugs generally were not detected at significant concentrations in the larger bodies of receiving water (Saint John River, Hillsborough River, and Bedford Bay, Canada). However, drug residues in the small receiving streams were 15 to 30% of the effluent median concentrations. Six compounds (caffeine, naproxen, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, metoprolol, and sotolol) were found to persist in a small stream for a distance of at least 17 km, suggesting that small stream exposure to pharmaceutically active residues may be relatively greater than that in large bodies of water. Bioassays assessing acute and chronic effects on four organisms were conducted on four high-use drugs: Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and salicylic acid (metabolite of acetyl salicylic acid). Results indicated no negative effects except for the chronic algal (Selanastrum capricornutum) growth test on ibuprofen (no-observed-effect concentration, 10 mu g/L: lowest-observed-effect concentration, 32 mu g/L). Effects of these four compounds on invertebrates and plants in the receiving environments are unlikely based on the concentrations measured.

AB The present study reports on the occurrence and chiral behavior of the anti-inflammatory drug (S)-naproxen (NAP)(S)-2-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propionic acidin an aquatic environment under both field and laboratory conditions. In influents and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Tama River basin (Tokyo), (S)-NAP was detected at concentrations of 0.03 mu gL(-1) to 0.43 mu gL(-1) and 0.01 mu gL(-1) to 0.11 mu gL(-1), respectively. The concentrations of a major metabolite, 6-O-desmethyl NAP (DM-NAP) were up to 0.47 mu gL(-1) and 0.56 mu gL(-1) in influents and effluents, respectively. (R)-naproxen was not detected in STP influents, although it was present in effluents, and the enantiomeric faction (= S/[S+R]) of NAP ranged from 0.88 to 0.91. Under laboratory conditions with activated sludge from STPs, rapid degradation of (S)-NAP to DM-NAP and chiral inversion of (S)-NAP to (R)-NAP were observed. During river die-away experiments, degradation and chiral inversion of NAP were extremely slow. In addition, chiral inversion of (S)-NAP to (R)-NAP was not observed during photodegradation experiments. In the river receiving STP discharge, NAP and DM-NAP concentrations reached 0.08 mu gL(-1) and 0.16 mu gL(-1), respectively. The enantiomeric faction of NAP in the river ranged from 0.84 to 0.98 and remained almost unchanged with the increasing contribution of rainfall to the river water. These results suggest that the absence and decrease of (R)-NAP in river waters could indicate the inflow of untreated sewage. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2671-2678. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB This study describes the occurrence, fate, and removal of free estrogens (estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)) and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (estrone-3-sulphate (E1-3S), 17 beta-estradiol-3-sulfate (E2-3S), estriol-3-sulfate (E3-3S), estrone-3-glucuronide (E1-3G), 17 beta-estradiol-3-glucuronide (E2-3G), and estriol-3-glucuronide (E3-3G)) in 12 sewage treatment plants in Japan. Glucuronide conjugates were only rarely detected in sewage influents and entirely eliminated within the treatment plants. E1 was found at 69 ng/L, E2 at 108 ng/L, E1-3S at 18 ng/L, and E2-3S at 78 ng/L in the sewage influents. The average removal efficiency for E1, E2, and sulfate conjugates was 88, 92, and 93%, respectively, following activated sludge treatment. The removal of E1 and E2 was improved with increasing the sludge retention time (SRT), with the highest removal typically found from 12 days SRT onward. The removal of sulfate conjugates was also related to SRT with highest removals found from eight days SRT onward. No correlation was found between the hydraulic retention time and the removal of any of the estrogens. The ozone dosage of 4-7 mg/L reduced E3 and E2-3S and E3-3S to below detection levels. Overall ozonation reduced the estrogenicity of the effluents as expressed as estradiol equivalents from 8.4 to 0.7 ng/L. The results suggest adequate river basin management of estrogens in Japan could be accomplished by a mixture of activated sludge plants with long SRT and where necessary, the addition of tertiary ozonation.

AB Temporary rivers become dependent on wastewater effluent for base flows, which severely impacts river ecosystems through exposure to elevated levels of nutrients, dissolved organic matter, and organic micropollutants. However, biodegradation processes occurring in these rivers can be enhanced by wastewater bacteria/biofilms. Here, we evaluated the attenuation of pharmaceuticals and their human metabolites performing retrospective analysis of 120 compounds (drugs, their metabolites and transformation products) in mesocosm channels loaded with wastewater effluents twice a week for a period of 31 days. Eighteen human metabolites and seven biotransformation products were identified with high level of confidence. Compounds were classified into five categories. Type-A: recalcitrant drugs and metabolites (diclofenac, carbamazepine and venlafaxine); Type-B: degradable drugs forming transformation products (TPs) (atenolol, sitagliptin, and valsartan); Type-C: drugs for which no known human metabolites or TPs were detected (atorvastatin, azithromycin, citalopram, clarithromycin, diltiazem, eprosartan, fluconazole, ketoprofen, lamotrigine, lormetazepam, metformin, telmisartan, and trimethoprim); Type-D: recalcitrant drug metabolites (4-hydroxy omeprazole sulfide, erythro/threohydrobupropion, and zolpidem carboxylic acid); Type-E: unstable metabolites whose parent drug was not detectable (norcocaine, benzolylecgonine, and erythromycin A enol ether). Noteworthy was the valsartan acid formation from valsartan with transient formation of TP-336.

AB Swine wastewater is not easily treated in biological wastewater treatment plants. One reason is that some antibiotics are not easily degradable in a normal treatment system and inhibit the biological organisms in the treatment system. Specifically, tetracycline, sulfathiazole, and ampicillin are representative antibiotics found in poultry wastewater. To degrade these refractory and impediment antibiotics more easily, a special method is needed, such as an enzyme method. This research used a special enzyme in an experiment that tested feasibility with an enzyme assay of biological treatment in vitro. The Glutathion S- Transferases ( GSTs) are a family of proteins that catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione with a variety of hydrophobic chemicals containing electrophilic centers. Using GSTs, these major antibiotics were transformed into components that were non-toxic to the microorganisms that treat manure wastewater. The initial concentration of tetracycline, sulfathiazole, and ampicillin were 100 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 50 mg/L, respectively, and the concentration of pig feed was the same as usual. The GSTs have made the effect of biotransformation of antibiotics as their mode. They were 60 - 70% transformed by GSTs at the end of the degradation reaction. This lowered their inhibitory strength against microorganisms.

AB This study sought to detect the global characteristics and developments of Fenton-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) focused on wastewater treatment. Using bibliometric and visualization analysis via VOSviwer, CiteSpace, and HistCite software, it investigated and analyzed different aspects, including growth trends, country, journal, category, and keyword analysis, as well as citation-burst detection of references to 5,940 records ranging from 1990 to 2019 in the Web of Science Core Collection. It was concluded that wastewaters in the textile industries, pharmaceutical industries, phenol compounds, and landfill leachates were currently and would continue to be the most focused industrial effluents that can be treated efficiently by applying Fenton-based AOPs. The study also conducted an in-depth analysis based on four clusters through the 100 most-occurring keywords, containing textile wastewater, catalyst, photo-Fenton, and electro-Fenton, identifying the four most studied research topics of Fenton-based AOPs. Studies about innovative (nano) catalysts, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic materials can provide new degradation possibilities and overcome the Fenton process's drawbacks. The results of this bibliometric analysis can be helpful information for researchers and industry practitioners.

AB This study aims to provide non-biological treatment solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, depending on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the wastewater. Commonly overlooked aspects of industrial wastewater such as its fluctuating characteristics, selection of suitable sampling points, and adopting an appropriate treatment methodology are addressed. Different units in a drug-producing industry and chief ingredients at each stage were identified. An appropriate sampling point was finalized following a series of systematic and repeated samplings of prominent industrial locations, at different periods. High organic and solids strength industrial wastewater samples were characterized and subjected to various physico-chemical and oxidative techniques, namely electrocoagulation (EC), chemical coagulation, photocatalytic oxidation, electro-Fenton's (EF), PhotoFenton's (PF), and Fenton's oxidation. The highest total organic carbon (TOC) reduction efficiencies about 47, 23, and 62 % were obtained from Fenton's oxidation for distinct samplings. The variation in quality of effluent heavily influences the treatment efficacies of individual treatment schemes. Hence, rigid treatment protocols are inadvisable to propose for industrial perspectives to handle diurnal variations in effluent characteristics. Rather, industry-specific solutions may be provided, depending on the type of wastewater generated.

AB Loads of individual commonly used analgesics (ibuprofen, diclofenac), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, propranolol) and neuroleptics (carbamazepine, citalopram) to a large-scale operating wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Sweden (Ryaverket) were studied by monitoring concentrations and flows during a 9-year period (2006-2015). Variations in loads due to sampling and possible errors in chemical analyses were estimated to be below 40%. The variations in loads were analyzed and discussed in terms of the design of collecting wastewater system as an integrated part of the water treatment at the WWTP as well as the prescription and use of individual pharmaceuticals. Trend analysis in daily loads of individual pharmaceuticals indicated an increase for diclofenac, no significant changes for ibuprofen and metoprolol and a decrease for the other pharmaceuticals. The latter was ascribed to a decrease in their prescription and use. The increase in loads of diclofenac was ascribed to its growing topical use not requiring prescription. In view of future regulations by the EU, growing loads of diclofenac to WWTPs and its low removal rates in WWTPs may require an upgrade of WWTPs to achieve quality standards for diclofenac in receiving waters.

AB In this study, the removal of clofibric acid, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, carbamazepine and diclofenac residues from wastewater, using a novel shear-induced cavitation generator has been systematically studied. The effects of temperature, cavitation time and H2O2 dose on removal efficiency were investigated. Optimisation (50 degrees C; 15 min; 340 mg L-1 of added H2O2) resulted in removal efficiencies of 4786% in spiked deionised water samples. Treatment of actual wastewater effluents revealed that although matrix composition reduces removal efficiency, this effect can be compensated for by increasing H2O2 dose (3.4 g L-1) and prolonging cavitation time (30 mm). Hydrodynamic cavitation has also been investigated as either a pre- or a post-treatment step to biological treatment. The results revealed a higher overall removal efficiency of recalcitrant diclofenac and carbamazepine, when hydrodynamic cavitation was used prior to as compared to post biological treatment i.e., 54% and 67% as compared to 39% and 56%, respectively. This is an important finding since diclofenac is considered as a priority substance to be included in the EU Water Framework Directive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the degradation of a mixture of nine pharmaceuticals was performed in near environmental concentrations (500 mu g L-1) using hospital wastewater as the matrix and employing as a coupling strategy solar photo-Fenton (SPF) treatment followed by adsorption. Different SPF approaches were studied. The best condition chosen for the degradation of the pharmaceuticals by SPF was that which used an initial concentration of H2O2 of 100 mg L-1 and multiple additions of Fe2+ of 5 mg L-1 at times of t = 0, 5, and 10 min in hospital wastewater. Degradation of 80% was obtained for Fluconazole, whereas the degradation of other pharmaceuticals achieved 99% of primary elimination. Consequently, 38 Transformation Products (TPs) were generated by the SPF process. The combination of SPF with the adsorption process using avocado seed activated carbon (ASAC) as sorbent was used to prevent TPs reaching the aqueous environment. For this reason, the SPF process was stopped after 15 min; and within this time, the largest number of TPs (28 TPs) was observed. A volume of 20 mL of hospital wastewater (HWW) previously treated by SPF was combined with 14 mg ASAC, for 15 min of contact time. This coupling removed 30 of the 36 compounds (remaining pharmaceuticals and TPs), with an open-chain and highly polar TPs having a 50% and 60% removal for FLT TP2 and FLT TP3, respectively. With respect to compounds that present aromatic rings, these presented a 98-100% removal rate in the coupled processes, with p-p interactions as the main interaction mechanisms with ASAC.

AB Hospital wastewater contains pharmaceutical residues, chemicals, and pathogens that cause coloration and nourish pathogenic microorganisms. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a medical wastewater treatment system at Military Hospital 175 (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) that combined a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system with nanofiltration (NF). The influent of the system was the wastewater discharged from the operating rooms of the hospital. The system has a capacity of 50 L/day and operates at three organic load rates (OLR) of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 kgCOD/m(3)day (COD: Chemical oxygen demand), in which each load rate operates for 40 days. The results showed that most nutritional criteria generally achieved positive results. Specifically, the average COD removal was shown to be consistently high throughout the three phases at 94%, 93.3%, and 92.7%, respectively. For removal of nitrogen, the system demonstrated efficiencies of 75%, 79%, and 83%, respectively, to three phases. The log removal value (LRV) for Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria were higher than four throughout the study period. The average removal efficiency for color and total iron was approximately 98% and 99%, respectively. The water quality after treatment, especially after NF, meets the Vietnamese standard of grade A. The arrangement in which the MBR preceded NF was also found to limit the amount of soil and solids entering subsequent treatment, which therefore improved the efficiency of NF, as demonstrated by the stability of post-NF transmembrane pressures throughout three cycles renewed by two backwashes.

AB A survey was conducted in regions of North China to better understand the effect of antibiotic residue pollution from swine feedlots to nearby groundwater environment. A total of nine experimental sites located in the regions of Beijing, Hebei, and Tianjin were selected to analyze the presence of residues of 11 most commonly used antibiotics, including tetracyclines (TCs), fluoroquinolones (FQNs), sulfonamides (SAs), macrolides, and fenicols, by using liquid chromatography spectrometry. The three most common antibiotics were TCs, FQNs, and SAs, with mean concentrations of 416.4, 228.8, and 442.4 mu g L-1 in wastewater samples; 19.9, 11.8, and 0.3 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples from swine feedlots; and 29.7, 14.0, and 0 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples from villages. Ordination analysis revealed that the composition and distribution of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (AGRs) were similar in groundwater samples from swine feedlots and villages. FQNs and TCs occurred along the path from wastewater to groundwater at high concentrations and showed correlations with ARGs, with a strong correlation between FQN resistance gene (qnrA) copy number. FQN concentration was also found (P < 0.01) in wastewater and groundwater in villages (P < 0.01). Therefore, antibiotics discharged from swine feedlots through wastewater could disseminate into surrounding groundwater environments together with ARG occurrence (i.e., qnrA, sulI, sulII, tetG, tetM, and tetO). Overall, this study suggests that the spread of veterinary antibiotics from swine feedlots to groundwater environments should be highly attended and controlled by restricting excess antibiotic usage or improving the technology of manure management.

AB The stability of 26 cytostatic drugs (21 parent compounds and 5 metabolites) in wastewater was studied using liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Wastewater aliquots were spiked with the target compounds at 1000 mu g L-1 and stored in the dark under different temperature (-20, 4 and 25 degrees C) and pH (acid and neutral) conditions for different periods of time (up to 3 months). The influence of these factors (temperature, pH and time) on the stability of the compounds was evaluated through an experimental design. The most negative factor was the time of storage, but temperature also exerted a very important influence. Acidification of the samples is a good option for some cytostatics (e.g., temozolomide, tamoxifen and its metabolites, and chlorambucil) but it may have a negative effect on others (e.g. ifosfamide). The design also showed correlations between factors indicating that an increase of the storage time is more relevant at high temperatures, while an increase of the temperature is more detrimental in non-acidified samples. After 3 months at -20 degrees C, all compounds with the exception of temozolomide, vinorelbine, imatinib and erlotinib presented recoveries below 80%. The most unstable compounds were oxaliplatin, 5-(3-N-methyltriazen-1-yl)-imidazole-4-carboxamide and chlorambucil. To the authors' knowledge, the stability data reported in the present study is the first ever published for most of the target compounds in wastewater. The results obtained point out storage at -20 degrees C from collection to analysis as the best storage option. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical residues and other emerging substances commonly summarised as micropollutants pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and end up in the receiving waters and sludge. Many studies have investigated the removal efficiency of various techniques but a holistic evaluation of various relevant treatment alternatives regarding both the removal efficiency for various micropollutants, investment and operating costs, environmental impacts and future comprehensiveness is still lacking. This paper provides the results from a large 3-year project about the evaluation of sustainable treatment systems for removal of various micropollutants or disruptive effects at Swedish WWTPs and their environmental, economic and future sustainability. The presented results are based on our own pilot tests and related assessment and modelling efforts and provide a holistic view on advanced treatment of wastewater for removal of micropollutants.

AB Large subsurface treatment systems (LSTS) and rapid infiltration basins (RIB) are preferred onsite wastewater treatments compared to direct discharge of treated wastewater to streams and adjacent facilities. Discharge of these wastewater treatments may result in contaminant loading to aquifers that also serve as drinking water sources downgradient from the discharge site. Until recently, few studies have characterized the contribution of micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals, fragrances, flame retardants, etc.) to receiving aquifers. We conducted a pilot project to characterize the occurrence of micropollutants in groundwater downgradient from 7 on-site treatment systems in Minnesota, USA: 5 community LSTS and 2 municipal RIB. One downgradient monitoring well was sampled three times at each facility over one year. Of 223 micropollutants analyzed, 35 were detected. Total sample concentrations ranged from 90 to 4,039 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) was detected in all samples at concentrations from 7 to 965 ng/L. Other pharmaceuticals (0.12-1,000 ng/L), organophosphorus flame retardants (10-500 ng/L), and other anthropogenic chemicals (4-775 ng/L) were also detected. The numbers and concentrations of micropollutants detected were inversely related to dissolved oxygen and depth to water. Ratios of pharmaceutical concentrations to human-health screening values were <0.10 for most samples. However, concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole exceeded screening values at two sites. Study results illustrate that large on-site wastewater systems designed to discharge to permeable soil or shallow groundwater effectively deliver pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants to groundwater aquifers and could contribute micropollutants to drinking water via water supply wells.

AB The deposition of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on semiconductors has been demonstrated to be an efficient route to improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to plasma resonance effect, but the photocatalytic efficiency of the available Ag-based photocatalysts is still low and far from practical application. In this study, a novel photocatalyst with Ag NPs deposited on the surface of AgIn5S8 (Ag/AgIn5S8) was fabricated via solvothermal method and further photo-reduction approach. The amount of deposited Ag nanoparticles has an obvious effect on the charge separation and visible-light photocatalytic activity of Ag/AgIn5S8, and 2.5% Ag/AgIn5S8 nanocomposites exhibit the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with 95.3% degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC% HCl) compared with that of the other samples due to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs, proper bandgap of AgIn5S8 and the synergistic effect between them. The main reactive species in TC% HCl degradation are center dot OH and center dot O-2(-). The possible degradation pathway of TC% HCl and photocatalytic mechanism of Ag/AgIn5S8 were proposed according to high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, main reactive species, and conduction band and valence band of AgIn5S8. Moreover, Ag/AgIn5S8 nanohybrids were applied to treat real pharmaceutical industry wastewater, and it was found that the mineralization efficiency and COD removal of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater can reach 56.3% and 77.6%, respectively. The above results indicate Ag/AgIn5S8 photocatalysts have a promising prospect in the treatment of real pharmaceutical industry wastewater.

AB Five endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) were determined in four urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey (MAM) in two seasonal periods (winter and summer). The MAM, one of the most urbanized areas in Mexico, is characterized by high industrial activity and population density, leading to extensive use of several EDCs. In the MAM, -90% of urban and industrial wastewater is treated in WWTPs, where EDCs can be partially eliminated. In this work, dissolved levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), 4-nonylphenol (4NP), and 4-tert-octylphenol (4TOP) in wastewater were determined. The EDCs' determination was carried out through solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). High EDCs levels (0.4-450 ng/L) were found in the influents of WWTPs, while concentrations in the effluents ranged from 0.2 to 26.8 ng/L, with E2, EE2, and 4TOP being the most persistent. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed the association between E2 and EE2 (r = 0.4835, p <0.05), and between BPA and 4NP (r = 0.5180, p < 0.05), suggesting that these EDCs have similar sources. Also, E2, BPA, and 4TOP were positively correlated with the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) (r = 0.4080-0.5694, p < 0.05), indicating the association of the EDCs with the organic matter in the wastewater. The factor analysis confirmed the significant correlation of COD, BOD, TSS, temperature, and pH with the high occurrence of 4TOP during the summer. It was also confirmed that summer warmer temperatures favored the removal of BPA and 4NP in the studied WWTPs. Finally, the studied sites were classified by cluster analysis in three groups, revealing the impact that seasonality has on the behavior of the selected EDCs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology is an interesting option for single-house wastewater treatment or small communities. Because typically a very high effluent quality is achieved with respect to pathogens, suspended solids, organics and nitrogen, the permeate is well suited for reuse. Little is known about the fate of micropollutants in such small systems. The differences between centralized and decentralized biological wastewater treatment with respect to micropollutants are manifold: besides the operational parameters like hydraulic and sludge retention time, the main difference is in the load variation. While the influent load is expected to be more or less constant in large catchments, it varies strongly in small MBRs due to irregular consumption (e.g. of medication by individuals). Concentrations of micropollutants are higher by a factor 50-1000 than in centralized treatment. It is also unknown how reliable degradation of micropollutants is in case of irregular exposure.
   In this study, two experiments were conducted in a small MBR treating the wastewater of a three-person household. During normal operation of the treatment plant, 25 pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, antiphlogistics, lipid regulators, iodinated contrast media and hormones) that had not been used by members of the household were added in concentrations typical for municipal wastewater. The removal of most substances was in the same range as for centralized wastewater treatment. It was shown that biological transformation was the main elimination process while adsorption to the activated sludge was negligible for most substances due to the low sludge production at high sludge retention time. No appreciable lag for inducing biological degradation was observed. The high hydraulic and sludge residence time had a positive effect on the elimination of slowly degradable substances, but this was partly compensated by the lower biological activity. An experiment with antibiotics concentrations typical for decentralized treatment (between 500 and 1000 mu g l(-1); sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, roxithromycin) did not show an inhibitory effect on either nitrification or denitrification.

AB The treatability of pharmaceutical industry wastewater bearing the antibiotic sulfamerazine in the lab-scale continuously feed upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor/continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system was investigated in order to determine the changes in the characterization on composition of the wastewater during biotreatment. The BOD5/COD ratio was determined to assess the approximate biodegradability. When the initial sulfamerazine concentration was 10 mg/l the methane percentage reached around 76% while it was measured at 60% at a sulfamerazine concentration of 90 mg/l. The total (overall) COD removal efficiency of the sequential UASB + CSTR treatment system was determined as 97%. The results of this study indicated that the system exhibited a good removal performance for sulfamerazine. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) technology has proven to be an effective and energy-saving method for treating wastewaters containing a single pharmaceutical in the lab-scale. However, the continuous degradation of pharmaceuticals in a scaled-up BEF has never been reported. In this study, a 20-L dual-chamber BEF reactor was designed and tested for treating six model pharmaceuticals. The effect of key operational factors including applied voltage, cathode Fe2+ dosage, initial pharmaceuticals concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT), were assessed. By implementing 0.1 V voltage, 0.3 mM Fe2+ and HRT of 26 h, the six selected pharmaceuticals (500 mu g L-1 for each) were removed completely. Moreover, transformation products during clofibric acid degradation, such as 4-chlororesorcinol, were detected and the relevant transformation pathwaywas proposed. Additionally, it successfully removed these pharmaceuticals in the real wastewater matrix. This paper contributes to scaling-up the BEF process for continuous and effective treating pharmaceuticals-contaminated wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the use of electrooxidation for treatment of wastewater obtained from a pharmaceutical industry. The wastewater primarily contained Gentamicin and Dexamethasone. With NaCl as supporting electrolyte, the effluent was treated in a cylindrical flow reactor in continuous (single pass) mode under various current densities (2-5 A/dm(2)) and flow rates (10-40 L/h). By cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis, the optimum condition for maximum redox reaction was determined. The efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and power consumption were studied for different operating conditions. From the results it was observed that maximum COD reduction of about 85.56% was obtained at a flow rate of 10 L/h with an applied current density of 4 A/dm(2). FT-IR spectra studies showed that during electrooxidation, the intensities of characteristic functional groups such as N-H, O-H were reduced and some new peaks also started to appear. Probable theory, reaction mechanism and modeling were proposed for the oxidation of pharmaceutical effluent. The experimental results demonstrated that electrooxidation treatment was very effective and capable of elevating the quality of treated wastewater to the reuse standard prescribed for pharmaceutical industries.

AB BACKGROUND The occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater has become a major concern for human health and the environment. Therefore, it is an important challenge to improve conventional wastewater treatment to remove these compounds. Coupling biological treatment with advanced oxidation technology has been widely studied in the literature, but only sequential associations of the two processes have been used. This study proposes an innovative concept based on a real integration of the photocatalytic oxidation process in a continuous recycling loop on a membrane bioreactor. The role of the oxidation here is not to completely degrade pharmaceuticals, but instead to oxidize them moderately to increase their biodegradability so that they can be eliminated by the biological process.
   RESULTS Preliminary experiments on the oxidation process indicated that a flux density of 5 W m(-2) was sufficient to increase biodegradability and decrease the toxicity of a cocktail of three pharmaceuticals. Then the performance of a 20-L continuous membrane bioreactor treating wastewater with seven pharmaceuticals, without and with pre-oxidation at 5 W m(-2), were compared. Pre-oxidation increased the global removal for some recalcitrant pharmaceuticals (from 3% to 47% for diclofenac and from 1% to 44% for furosemide) without affecting either the removal of carbon, nitrogen or phosphorous by activated sludge, or of already highly removed pharmaceuticals.
   CONCLUSION This work proves the feasibility of an innovative concept of a continuous hybrid process coupling a photocatalytic oxidation process and a membrane bioreactor for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, with low cost and size. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)

AB Current wastewater treatment technologies do not remove many unregulated hydrophilic compounds, and there is growing interest that low levels of these compounds, referred to as emerging contaminants, may impact human health and the environment. A probabilistic-designed monitoring network was employed to infer the extent of Florida's ambient freshwaters containing the wastewater (Includes reuse water, septic systems leachate, and wastewater treatment effluent.) indicators sucralose, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and primidone and those containing the widely used pesticide imidacloprid. Extent estimates with 95% confidence bounds are provided for canals, rivers, streams, small and large lakes, and unconfined aquifers containing ultra-trace concentrations of these compounds as based on analyses of 2015 sample surveys utilizing 528 sites. Sucralose is estimated to occur in greater than 50% of the canal, river, stream, and large lake resource extents. The pharmaceuticals acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and primidone are most prevalent in rivers, with approximately 30% of river kilometers estimated to contain at least one of these compounds. Imidacloprid is estimated to occur in 50% or greater of the canal and river resource extents, and it is the only compound found to exceed published toxicity or environmental effects standards. Geospatial analyses show sucralose detection frequencies within Florida's drainage basins to be significantly related to the percentage of urban land use (R (2) = 0.36, p < 0.001), and imidacloprid detection frequencies to be significantly related to the percentage of urban and agricultural land use (R (2) = 0.47, p < 0.001). The extent of the presence of these compounds highlights the need for additional emerging contaminant studies especially those examining effects on aquatic biota.

AB A membrane-integrated continuous system was designed with new orientation of the membrane modules and investigated for treatment of industrial wastewater using forward osmosis (FO) in the upstream and nanofiltration in the recovery stage. Effects of applied pressure, cross-flow rate of feed water, variations of draw solution concentration and the run time on effectiveness of the system in separation and yield of pure water flux were studied in a continuous scheme in the context of pharmaceutical wastewater being a very complex system. Polyamide composite membranes out of a given lot were screened for application in FO and draw solute recovery stages. Two draw solutions in different concentrations (made of NaCl and MgSO4) were examined, where 0.5 M NaCl was found to be the best one for the FO stage. During investigation with pharmaceutical wastewater, more than 97 % purification could be achieved in terms of chemical oxygen demand while analysis of specific compounds such as Nebivolol and Paracetamol indicated almost 100 % removal. The study revealed that the new design could significantly reduce concentration polarization and reverse salt diffusion resulting in a sustained yield of pure water flux of around 52 L/m(2)h using NaCl as draw solute. Downstream nanofiltration module operated at only 12 bar trans-membrane pressure ensured continuous recovery and recycle of 99 % of the draw solute while producing safe reusable water at the rate of 58-60 L/m(2)h. The study culminates not only in a new design for a clean water environment but also in definite policy suggestions.

AB A year-round monitoring survey of sewage flowing into sewage treatment plants located in urban Japan was conducted by targeting seven representative pharmaceutical components-atenolol (ATL), ciprofloxacin (CFX), clarithromycin (CTM), diclofenac (DCF), diltiazem (DTZ), disopyramide (DSP), and sulpiride (SPR)-detected in the river environment. For each of these components, two types of predicted concentration were estimated on the basis of two types of data (the shipping volume and sales volume of each component). The measured concentration of each component obtained through the survey and the two types of estimated predicted concentration of each component were then compared. The correspondence ratio between the predicted concentration estimated from the shipping volume of the component and the measured concentration (predicted concentration/measured concentration) was, for ATL, 3.1; CFX, 1.4; CTM, 1.4; DCF, 0.2; DTZ, 0.9; DSP, 11.6; and SPR, 1.1. The correspondence ratio between the predicted concentration estimated from the sales volume of the component and the measured concentration was, for ATL, 0.5; CFX, 1.1; CTM, 0.8; DCF, 0.1; DTZ, 0.2; DSP, 0.7; and SPR, 0.8. Although a generally corresponding trend was seen regardless of whether the prediction was based on shipping volume or sales volume, the predicted concentrations estimated from the shipping volumes of all components expect DSP were found, to our knowledge for the first time in Japan, to correspond better than those based on sales volumes to the measured concentrations. These findings should help to improve the prediction accuracy of concentrations of pharmaceutical components in river waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficiency of wastewater treatment systems in removing pharmaceuticals is often assessed on the basis of the decrease in the concentration of the parent compound. However, what is perceived as "removal" during treatment may not necessarily mean mineralization of the pharmaceutical compound but simply conversion into different transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QToF-MS), we demonstrated conversion of iopromide in wastewater to at least 14 TPs after an advanced oxidation process (AOP) using UV (fluence = 1500 mJ/cm(2)) and H2O2 (10 mg/L). Due to the complexity of the wastewater matrix, the initial experiments were performed using a high concentration (10 mg/L) of iopromide in order to facilitate the identification of TPs. Despite the high concentration of iopromide used, cursory inspection of UV and mass spectra only revealed four TPs in the chromatograms of the post-AOP samples. However, the use of METLIN database and statistics-based profiling tools commonly used in metabolomics proved effective in discriminating between background signals and TPs derived from iopromide. High-resolution mass data allowed one to predict molecular formulas of putative TPs with errors below 5 ppm relative to the observed m/z. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data and isotope pattern comparisons provided necessary information that allowed one to elucidate the structure of iopromide TPs. The presence of the proposed iopromide TPs was determined in unspiked wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, but no iopromide and TPs were detected. Using analogous structural modifications and oxidation that results from the AOP treatment of iopromide, the potential TPs of iopamidol (a structurally similar compound to iopromide) were predicted. The same mass fragmentation pattern observed in iopromide TPs was applied to the predicted iopamidol TPs. LC-QToF-MS revealed the presence of two iopamidol TPs in unspiked AOP-treated wastewater.

AB In conventional sorption studies, the prior presence of contaminants in the soil is not considered when estimating the sorption parameters because this is only a transient state. However, this parameter should be considered in order to avoid the under/overestimation of the soil sorption capacity. In this study, the sorption of naproxen, carbamazepine and triclosan was determined in a wastewater irrigated soil, considering the initial mass of the compounds. Batch sorption-desorption tests were carried out at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 30-40 cm), using either 10 mM CaCl2 solution or untreated wastewater as the liquid phase. Data were satisfactorily fitted to the initial mass model. For the two soils, release of naproxen and carbamazepine was observed when the CaCl2 solution was used, but not in the soil/wastewater system. The compounds' release was higher in the topsoil than in the 30-40 cm soil. Sorption coefficients (K-d) for CaCl2 solution tests showed that in the topsoil, triclosan (64.9 L kg(-1)) is sorbed to a higher extent than carbamazepine and naproxen (5.81 and 2.39 L kg(-1), respectively). In the 30-40 cm soil, carbamazepine and naproxen K-d values (11.4 and 4.41 L kg(-1), respectively) were higher than those obtained for the topsoil, while the triclosan Ka value was significantly lower than in the topsoil (19.2 L kg(-1)). Differences in K-d values were found when comparing the results obtained for the two liquid phases. Sorption of naproxen and carbamazepine was reversible for both soils, while sorption of triclosan was found to be irreversible. This study shows the sorption behavior of three pharmaceuticals in a wastewater irrigated soil, as well as the importance of considering the initial mass of target pollutants in the estimation of their sorption parameters.

AB Microbial degradation is the most important process to remove organic pollutants in Waste Water Treatment Plants. Regarding chiral compounds this process is normally enantioselective and needs the suitable analytical methodology to follow the removal of both enantiomers in an accurate way. Thus, this paper describes the development and validation of an enantioselective High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection (HPLC-FD) method for simultaneous analysis of fluoxetine (FLX) and norfluoxetine (NFLX) in wastewater effluents. Briefly, this method preconcentrated a small volume of wastewater samples (50 mL) on 500 mg Oasis MCX cartridges and used HPLC-FD with a vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase under reversed mode for analyses. The optimized mobile phase was EtOH/aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (92.5/7.5, v/v) at pH 6.8. The effect of EtOH percentage, buffer concentration, pH, column oven temperature and flow rate on chromatographic parameters was systematically investigated. The developed method was validated within the wastewater effluent used in microcosms laboratory assays. Linearity (R-2 > 0.99), selectivity and sensitivity were achieved in the range of 4.0-60 ng mL(-1) for enantiomers of FLX and 2.0-30 ng mL(-1) for enantiomers of NFLX. The limits of detection were between 0.8 and 2.0 ng mL(-1) and the limits of quantification were between 2.0 and 4.0 ng mL(-1) for both enantiomers of FLX and the enantiomers of its demethylated metabolite NFLX. The validated method was successfully applied and proved to be robust to follow the degradation of both enantiomers of FLX in wastewater samples, during 46 days. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutants from wastewater by ozone, the ozone rate constants of the micropollutants and the kinetics of the reaction of ozone with wastewater must be known. The latter is multiphasic with k = 0.071 (mg DOQ)(-1) s(-1) for the first mg/L ozone (at a DOC of 7.2 mg/L) followed by 0.011 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) the next 5 mg/L ozone and the k = 0.0019 (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1) for subsequent 4 mg/L ozone as determined by stopped-flow and batch-quench methods. An analysis of gel permeation and UV absorption data indicates that the wastewater DOC is largely polymeric, and at 12 mg/L the concentration of its subunits must be near 100 mu M with epsilon(254 nm) approximate to 3000 M(-1) cm(-1). The center dot OH radical yield as determined by the tertiary butanol assay is similar to 13%. From its dose dependence, it follows that new center dot OH-generating sites are formed during ozonation. The center dot OH scavenging capacity of the wastewater DOC has been determined at 3 x 10(4) (mg DOC)(-1) s(-1). The contribution of bicarbonate to the OH scavenging capacity is small in comparison, similar to 10% of DOC. Simulations indicate that at 5 mg/L ozone only the most reactive (k > 3 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) micropollutants; are fully eliminated but at 10 mg/L ozone the slow ozone decay starts to contribute and even the much less reactive ones (k = 300 M(-1) s(-1)) are oxidized (25% remaining).

AB Little is known about the significance of hospitals as point sources for emission of organic micropollutants into the aquatic environment A mass flow analysis of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics used in hospitals was performed on the site of a representative Swiss cantonal hospital. Specifically, we analyzed the consumption of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and cytostatics in their corresponding medical applications of radiology and oncology, respectively, and their discharge into hospital wastewater and eventually into the wastewater of the municipal wastewater treatment plant. Emission levels within one day and over several days were found to correlate with the pharmacokinetic excretion pattern and the consumed amounts in the hospital during these days. IN total emissions vary substantially from day to day from 255 to 1259 g/d, with a maximum on the day when the highest radiology treatment occurred. Parent cytostatic compounds reach maximal emissions of 8-10 mg/d. A total of 1.1%, 1.4%, and 3.7% of, the excreted amounts of the cytostatics 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (main metabolite of gemcitabine), respectively, were found in the hospital wastewater, whereas 49% of the total ICM was detected, showing a high variability among the compounds. These recoveries can essentially be explained by the high amount administered to out-patients (70% for cytostatics and 50% for ICM); therefore, only part of this dose is expected,to be excreted on-site. In addition, this study emphasizes critical issues to consider when sampling in hospital sewer systems. Flow proportional sampling over a longer period is crucial to compute robust hospital mass flows.

AB The removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists and engineers. Ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI, Fe-VI) is a promising oxidant and the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents has been investigated in this study. Firstly, Fe-VI oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals was examined by determining the apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) in buffer solutions as a function of pH (5.0-9.5). At pH 8.0, k(app) of cimetidine, famotidine, nalidixic acid, ronidazole, dimetridazole, tinidazole, and caffeine are (1.6 +/- 0.2)x10(3), (7.8 +/- 0.3)x10(2), 2.6 +/- 0.4, 1.7 +/- 0.1, 0.9 +/- 0.3, 0.2 +/- 0.1, and < 0.1 M-1 s(-1), respectively. However, k(app) could not be directly employed to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluents due to the inhibited or enhanced effects of effluent organic matters (EfOM). Therefore, an alternative approach of spectroscopic surrogates was investigated since fluorophore was co-degraded with pharmaceuticals in the wastewater effluents. Particularly, the humic-like fluorescent peak correlated well with the pharmaceutical attenuation. The relationship of the reduction of fluorescence and the removal of pharmaceuticals could be described through a universal equation: y = A(1)x(k1/kw) + A(2)x(k2/kw) + A(3). The practical utility of the fluorescence surrogate was validated by applying to field samples. Monitoring the changes of the fluorescence surrogate provides a promising, rapid, and inexpensive method for estimating the degradation of pharmaceuticals during Fe-VI treatment of wastewater effluents.

The effects of solution temperature, type of electrode pair, current density, conductivity and initial COD concentration on the removal efficiency of COD and turbidity were investigated. Experimental results indicated that the removal efficiency of COD and turbidity are 95% and 98%, respectively, found with the use of Fe/Al as electrode pair and the specific energy consumption was 0.48 kWh/kg COD after 20 min of electrolysis time. The optimum temperature, current density, conductivity and initial COD concentration were found to be 298 K, 15.56 mA/cm(2), 3.20 mS/cm and 5,000 mg/L, respectively.

AB We created a database in order to quantitatively assess the occurrence and removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). From 117 scientific publications, we compiled 6641 data covering 184 PPCPs. Data included the concentrations of PPCPs in WWTP influents and effluents, their removal efficiency and their loads to the aquatic environment. The first outputs of our database allowed to identify the most investigated PPCPs in WWTPs and the most persistent ones, and to obtain reliable and quantitative values on their concentrations, frequency of detection and removal efficiency in WWTPs. We were also able to compare various processes and pointed out activated sludge with nitrogen treatment and membrane bioreactor as the most efficient ones. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biodegradation of three active compounds of pharmaceuticals clofibric acid, ibuprofen, and diclofenac was investigated in short-term tests with a pilot sewage plant (PSP) and biofilm reactors (BFR, oxic and anoxic) as model systems for municipal sewage treatment. The PSP was characterized with respect to mixing behavior, the BFR with respect to biofilm content and sorption of the pharmaceutical compounds. The short-term experiments were carried out for 55 It in the PSP and for 48 h in the BFR. The concentration of the pharmaceuticals was in the microgram per liter range in presence of readily biodegradable substances in the milligram per liter range. Therefore, a too short time period and too low concentration to promote adaption of the microorganisms were applied. Under the operating conditions applied the biodegradation of the lipid lowering agent clofibric acid and the analgesic agents ibuprofen and diclofenac in the oxic BFR resembled that in the PSP. Clofibric acid and diclofenac were not eliminated and reached a level of approximately 95% of their initial concentration, whereas the concentration of ibuprofen was decreased to approximately 40% in the PSP and to approximately 35% in the oxic BFR. Both systems showed, therefore, an inherent ability for ibuprofen biodegradation. Elimination in the anoxic BFR resulted in a decrease of the concentration of all three substances to values between 60 and 80% of their initial concentration. In contrast to the PSP acetone revealed as inhibitor in the BFR. In both systems acetone was not degraded in the short-term tests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are a category of micropollutants frequently detected across integrated urban wastewater systems. Existing modelling tools supporting the evaluation of micropollutant fate in such complex systems, such as the IUWS_MP model library (which acronym IUWS stands for Integrated Urban Wastewater System), do not consider fate processes and fractions that are typical for PhACs. This limitation was overcome by extending the existing IUWS_MP model library with new fractions (conjugated metabolites, sequestrated fraction) and processes (consumption-excretion, deconjugation). The performance of the extended library was evaluated for five PhACs (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, furosemide) in two different integrated urban wastewater systems where measurements were available. Despite data uncertainty and the simplicity of the modelling approach, chosen to minimize data requirements, model prediction uncertainty overlapped with the measurements ranges across both systems, stressing the robustness of the proposed modelling approach. Possible applications of the extended IUWS_MP model library are presented, illustrating how this tool can support urban water managers in reducing environmental impacts from PhACs discharges.

AB In spite of good performances of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) process, permeate from it can still contain refractory pollutants that have to be removed before water reuse or discharge. The present study is an attempt to combine the advantages of two well-known technologies, which are nanofiltration (NF) and electrochemical oxidation (EO) to treat MBR effluent from hospital wastewater. The concept is based on a preconcentration of micropollutants with a reduction of the wastewater volume by NF and treatment of the NF retentate by oxidation. During filtration process the rejection of ciprofloxacin, as a target molecule, reached beyond 97%. Then the NF retentate was treated by EO using a boron-doped diamond anode (BDD). Galvanostatic electrolyses showed that this anode is efficient to mineralize not only ciprofloxacin but also all the micropollutants and organics contained in MBR effluent. The results demonstrated that rapid mineralization occurred: the removal of total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 97% and 100%, respectively, in our conditions in 300 min maximum. The specific energy consumption for the total removal of COD was calculated to be 50 kW h kg(-1) COD.

AB This work presents an effective sample preparation method for the evaluation of seven pharmaceutical compounds belonging to different therapeutic classes in purified water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The target compounds include caffeine (stimulant), nicotine (stimulant), atenolol (beta blocker), metamizole (anti-inflammatory and analgesic), fluoxetine (antidepressant), paraxanthine (stimulant) and clofibric acid (lipid regulator). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were selected as extraction and detection techniques, respectively. A detailed study of the experimental conditions of extraction was performed. Under optimal conditions, recoveries obtained were in the range of 21% to 100%, and the relative standard deviations were below 12%. The detection and quantification limits of the method were in the range 2.2-97.4 and 21.1-324.7 ng L-1, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to evaluate the presence of these pharmaceutical compounds in wastewaters samples from wastewater treatment plants located on the Gran Canaria Island (Spain). Most of the compounds were detected at concentrations up to 12.31 mu g L-1 in the WWTP influents that were studied.

AB The treatment of high-strength organic brewery wastewater with added acetaminophen (MP) by an anaerobic digester was investigated. An anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) was operated as a continuous process with an organic loading rate of 1.5-g COD per litre per day and a hydraulic retention time of three days. The results of steady-state analysis showed that the greatest APBR performances for removing COD and TOC were as high as 98 and 93%, respectively, even though the anaerobic digestibility after adding the different AAP concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 mg L-1 into brewery wastewater can affect the efficiency of organic matter removal. The average CH4 production decreased from 81 to 72% is counterbalanced by the increased CO2 production from 11 to 20% before and after the injection of AAP, respectively. The empirical kinetic models for substrate utilisation and CH4 production were used to predict that, under unfavourable conditions, the performance of the APBR treatment process is able to remove COD with an efficiency of only 6.8%.

AB BACKGROUND: Ultrafiltration (UF) has led to the recovery of valuable products from seafood processing wastes. However, the use of crustacean process wastewaters as a source of bioactive compounds with application in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries has been scarcely studied to date.
   RESULTS: This study reports the recovery of high concentrations of astaxanthin (10(-13) mu g mL(-1)) by 300 kDa ultrafiltration of shrimp cooking wastewater, indicating that astaxanthin is associated with high MW retained proteins. Individual UF with 300, 100 and 30 kDa MWCO membranes and the sequential UF 100 -> 30 kDa were the most effective configurations for protein concentration. Hydrolysates from these three protein-concentrated fractions showed very potent ACE-inhibitory (1.98, 9.87 and 23.10 mu g mL(-1) IC50 values) and beta-carotene bleaching activities compared with hydrolysates from other fish and seafood species.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, shrimp cooking wastewater is a good source of astaxanthin and bioactive peptides. This approach based on the ultrafiltration of shrimp cooking wastewaters contributes towards the depuration of this by-product, while enabling the recovery and production of high value-added products.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds in wastewater released from human consumption have received considerable attention because of their possible risks for aquatic environments. In this study, the occurrence and removal of 10 pharmaceuticals in three municipal wastewater treatment plants in southern China were investigated and the environmental risks they posed were assessed. Nifedipine, atenolol, metoprolol, valsartan and pravastatin were detected in the influent wastewater. The highest average concentration in the influents was observed for metoprolol (164.6 ng/L), followed by valsartan (120.3 ng/L) in August, while median concentrations were higher in November than in August. The total average daily mass loadings of the pharmaceuticals in the three plants were 289.52 mg/d/person, 430.46 mg/d/person and 368.67 mg/d/person, respectively. Elimination in the treatment plants studied was incomplete, with metoprolol levels increasing during biological treatment. Biological treatment was the most effective step for PhACs removal in all of the plants studied. Moreover, the removal of PhACs was observed with higher efficiencies in August than in November. The WWTP equipped with an Unitank process exhibited similar removals of most PhACs as other WWTPs equipped with an anoxic/oxic (A/O) process or various anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(2)/O) process. The environmental risk assessment concluded that all of the single PhAC in the effluents displayed a low risk (RQ < 0.1) to the aquatic environments.

AB Stability and removal of the anti-anxiety drug diazepam (valium) from spiked wastewater samples were studied. An advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), utilizing ultrafiltration (UF), activated charcoal (AC), and reverse osmosis (RO) after the secondary biological treatment showed that UF and RO were relatively sufficient in removing spiked diazepam to a safe level. Kinetic studies in both pure water (abiotic degradation) and in sludge (biotic degradation) at room temperature were investigated. Diazepam showed high chemical stability toward degradation in pure water, and underwent faster biodegradation in sludge providing two main degradation products. The degradation reactions in sludge and pure water showed first-order kinetics with rate constant values of 2.6x10(-7)s(-1) and 9.08x10(-8)s(-1), respectively (half-life=31 and 88d, respectively). Adsorption of diazepam by activated carbon and composite micelle-clay (octadecyltrimethylammonium montmorillonite) complex was studied using both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Based on the determination coefficient, Langmuir isotherm was found to better fit the data, indicating the retention of diazepam monolayer on both adsorbents. Filtration of 100mgL(-1) solutions of diazepam by micelle-clay filter yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of 2mLmin(-1).

AB Microbiological flocculation in wastewater by a strain of Bacillus mucilaginosus was examined and the flocculation mechanism was investigated using Coomassie brilliant blue reaction, Anthrone reaction, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), scanning electronic microscope, and infrared spectroscopy. The GY03 strain, isolated from farmland soil, was identified as B. mucilaginosus by its morphology and 16S rDNA sequence. Cultivated in a nitrogen-free medium, the flocculation material (bacterium-mineral complex) was used to treat domestic, brewage, and pharmaceutical wastewater. On the basis of one-way experimental results, orthogonal experiments were carried out and the optimum processing conditions of the microbial flocculants were obtained. In the optimal conditions, the maximal removal ratio of COD in domestic, brewage, and pharmaceutical wastewater reached 74.6%, 70.5%, and 66.2%, respectively; the maximal removal ratio of BOD was 42.3%, 77.4%, and 41.7%, respectively; and the maximal removal of SS amounted 93.3%, 93.6%, and 88.4%, respectively. The treatment to kaolin suspended liquid by the GY03 strain may act as a model of studying microbial flocculation mechanisms in which bridging and charge neutralization hypothesis were proposed as the critical reasons based upon the experimental observations.

AB Ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater was investigated in pilot-scale after a high- and a low loaded activated sludge process. Higher ozone doses were required to remove organic micropollutants in the effluent wastewater from the high loaded activated sludge process. Further comparison of the micropollutant removal was based on normalized ozone doses, expressed as g O-3/g DOC and g O-3/g soluble COD (sCOD). A clear difference was noted for the two effluents when the micropollutant removal was normalized by DOC. This difference disappeared almost completely when the removal was linked to ozone doses normalized by sCOD. The dose-response curves for the organic micropollutants were practically linear in the removal range up to 95%. A linear prediction model was developed and compared with literature values to test the transferability of the obtained results. Results from this comparison indicated that the slope of the dose-response functions could be used to predict the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants at a third plant with an average uncertainty of 10%. The modeled ozone requirements were then set in relation to the COD concentrations in the discharged wafer from approximately 90 Swedish activated sludge treatment plants with and without nitrogen removal. This comparison highlighted the need for a well-functioning biological treatment for an effective ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants. The results in this study suggest that soluble COD should be further explored for design and modeling of ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater.

AB Carbendazim is a fungicide commonly used as active substance in plant protection products and biocidal products, for instance to protect facades of buildings against fungi. However, the subsequent occurrence of this fungicide and potential endocrine disruptor in the aqueous environment is a major concern. In this study, high resolution mass spectrometry shows that carbendazim can be detected with an increasing abundance from the source to the mouth of the River Rhine. Unexpectedly, the abundance of carbendazim correlates poorly with that of other fungicides used as active ingredients in plant protection products (r(2) of 0.32 for cyproconazole and r(2) of 0.57 for propiconazole) but it correlates linearly with that of pharmaceuticals (r(2) of 0.86 for carbamazepine and r(2) of 0.89 for lamotrigine). These results suggest that the occurrence of carbendazim in surface water comes mainly from the discharge of treated domestic wastewater. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the detection of carbendazim in wastewater effluents (n = 22). In fact, bench -scale leaching tests of textiles and papers revealed that these materials commonly found in households could be a source of carbendazim in domestic wastewater. Moreover, additional river samples collected nearby two paper industries indicate that the discharge of their treated process effluents is also a source of carbendazim in the environment. While characterizing paper and textile as overlooked sources of carbendazim, this study also shows the biocide as a possible ubiquitous wastewater contaminant that would require further systematic and worldwide monitoring due to its toxicological properties.

AB The occurrence of specific micropollutants (MPs), indicators of domestic and hospital wastewater, was investigated in a river connected to a karst spring based on two sampling campaigns under varying flow conditions. The MPs characterized by a high frequency of occurrence (acesulfame-K, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, nonylphenol, and iohexol) were highly reflective of wastewater discharged in ephemeral streams and tributaries, as well as specific point sources such as farms and hospital effluents. A mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes allows the quantification of the percentage of untreated wastewater effluents in inflowing water from river tributaries, which varied between 0.7-99% and 5.0-10% in low flow and high flow, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of MPs is related to the volume of wastewater input, extent of river dilution, persistence of the MPs, and type of point source contamination on the river. Relationships were established between MPs such as ibuprofen and acesulfame-K (ACE-K), indicating their co-existence in highly consumed generic medicine and their suitability as wastewater co-tracers. Additionally, the number of consumers of gemfibrozil (GEM) and acesulfame-K were estimated based on mass loads in the river tributaries for management purposes. Groundwater contamination is mostly due to diffuse and point sources infiltration occurring on the spring catchment, including the sinking stream that could contribute up to 17% to the mass loads of some micropollutants (e.g., ACE-K and GEM) at the spring. Nevertheless, the increase of MPs use with growing urbanization is expected to have a much significant impact on the groundwater quality in the future.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMP), e.g. pharmaceuticals and household/industrial chemicals, are not fully eliminated in state-of-the-art municipal wastewater treatment plants and can potentially harm the aquatic environment. Therefore, several pilot and large-scale investigations on the elimination of organic micropollutants have taken place in recent years. Based on the present findings, the most efficient treatment steps to eliminate organic micropollutants have proven to be ozonation, adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC), or filtration through granular activated carbon (GAC). Yet a further treatment step implies an increase in energy demand of the wastewater treatment plant, which has to be considered along with OMP elimination. To this aim, data on energy demand of ten large-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with processes for OMP elimination was collected and analyzed. Moreover, calculations on energy demand beyond the WWTP for production and transport of ancillary materials were performed to assess the cumulative energy demand of the processes. An assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions of the processes was achieved, which shall facilitate future life cycle analyses. The results show that energy demand of ozonation at the wastewater treatment plant is dependent upon the ozone dosage and is significantly higher than energy demand of PAC addition or GAC filtration (2 to 4 times higher without consideration of delivery heads). Despite uncertainties regarding the energy demand for production of activated carbon, it could be shown that the cumulative energy demand of adsorption steps is significantly higher than the energy demand at the WWTP. Using reactivated GAC can lead to energy and greenhouse gas emissions savings compared to using fresh GAC/PAC. Moreover, energy demand is always plant-specific and depends on different factors (delivery heads, existing filtration or post-treatment etc.). Since processes for elimination of organic micropollutants are still in a developing phase, future optimization steps shall minimize their energy demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macroporous cryogels for capturing cisplatin were synthesized by cryogelation polymerization of methacrylic acid and 2-hydroxyethyl metacrylate. The cryogel materials exhibited good mechanical property, high swelling ratio and high affinity for cisplatin, with an adsorption capacity of up to 150 mg cisplatin per gram of cryogel. The correlation between the capacity of the cryogel and the monomer composition in the material was investigated in this study. The physical and chemical properties of the cryogels were studied in detail using scanning electron microscopy, textural analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The optimal cryogel can be reused for at least 14 cycles of adsorption/desorption to remove cisplatin from water without noticeable reduction of capacity. The experimental results suggest that the cryogel may be used as affinity adsorbents to remove cisplatin from wastewater discharged from pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals.

AB Trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals are frequently detected in the urban water cycle, including wastewater, surface water and groundwater, as well as drinking water. These also include human metabolites (HMs), which are formed in the human body and then excreted via urine or feces, as well as transformation products (TPs) formed in engineered treatment systems and the aquatic environment. In the current study, the occurrence of HMs as well as their TPs of the anticonvulsants carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) were investigated using LC tandem MS in effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), surface water and groundwater. Highest concentrations were observed in raw wastewater for 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOHCBZ), 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-cabamazepine (100HCBZ) and CBZ with concentrations ranging up to 2.7 +/- 0.4, 1.7 +/- 0.2 and 1.07 +/- 0.06 mu g L-1, respectively. Predictions of different toxicity endpoints using a Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) expert system query indicated that several HMs and TPs, in particular 9-carboxy-acridine (9-CA-ADIN) and acridone (ADON), may exhibit an increased genotoxicity compared to the parent compound CBZ. As 9-CA-ADIN was also detected in groundwater, a detailed investigation of the genotoxicity of 9-CA-ADIN is warranted. Investigations of an advanced wastewater treatment plant further revealed that the discharge of the investigated compounds into the aquatic environment could be substantially reduced by ozonation followed by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration.

AB Fenton oxidation has proved to be effective for the treatment of a real hospital wastewater. The intensification of the process viz. the improvement on the efficiency of H2O2 consumption, by increasing the temperature, is necessary to operate in a single step and avoid high reaction times and the need of large H2O2 and iron concentrations. This approach would allow taking advantage of the heat energy contained in the laundry stream since the washing process is performed at high temperature to assure disinfection of the hospital textiles. In this work, temperatures within the range of 50-90 degrees C have been tested, which allowed an effective oxidation of the real wastewater ([COD](0) = 365 mg L-1, [Phenols](0) = 8.4 mg L-1, [total coliforms](0) = 4.16 x 10(6) MPN/100 mL, 5 toxicity units) with the stoichiometric amount of H2O2 (1000 mg L-1) and a relatively low iron concentration (25 mg L-1 Fe3+). Operating at 90 degrees C, complete disappearance of phenolic compounds and 70% and 50% reduction of COD and TOC were achieved in 1 h reaction time. Time evolution of those global parameters were appropriately fitted to pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, providing a useful approach for design purposes. The main by-products were short-chain organic acids (oxalic and formic), being the final effluents non-toxic. Disinfection of the hospital wastewater was also achieved at all the operating temperatures tested, as confirmed by the absence of coliforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the effect of chlorine disinfection on the following commonly prescribed antibiotics typically present in treated wastewater: ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin and ofloxacin. Antibacterially active transformation products formed from all of the fluoroquinolone class antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole did not form products with detectable antibacterial activity. Experiments were performed in both ultrapure water and wastewater effluent. HPLC/MS was used to propose the structures of the transformation products in samples where antibacterially active products formed. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated products were observed. The results indicate that antibiotic transformation products with antibacterial properties form in the wastewater chlorination treatment process. These products may be a source of antibiotic resistance in the environment and warrant a further investigation of their role.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) relies on the principle that traces of compounds, which a population is exposed to or consume, are excreted unchanged or as metabolites in urine and/or feces, and ultimately end up in the sewer network. Measuring target metabolic residues i.e. biomarkers in raw urban wastewater allows identifying the exposure or use of substances of interest in a community. Up to date, the most popular application of WBE is the estimation of illicit drug use and studies have been made mainly across Europe, which has allowed estimating and comparing drug use in many European cities. However, until now a comprehensive study applying WBE on the most frequently consumed illicit drugs has not been performed in South American countries. In this work, we applied this approach to samples from Colombia, selecting two of the most populated cities: Bogota and Medellin. Several biomarkers were selected to estimate drug use of cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), heroin and ketamine. Composite samples (24-h) were collected at the corresponding municipal wastewater treatment plants. Sample treatment was performed at location by applying solid-phase extraction (SPE). Before SPE, the samples were spiked with appropriate isotope labeled internal standards. In parallel, samples (spiked with the analytes under study at two concentration levels) were also processed for quality control. Analysis of influent wastewater was made by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, with triple quadrupole analyzer. Data shown in this paper reveal a high use of cocaine by the population of the selected Colombian cities, particularly from Medellin, while the use of other illicit drugs were low. The relevance of using quality control samples, particularly in collaborative studies, as those presented in this work, where research groups from different countries participate and where the samples had to be shipped overseas, is highlighted in this paper.

AB Two cosmetic ingredients (galaxolide, tonalide), eight pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide) and three hormones (estrone, 17beta-estradiol and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol) have been surveyed along the different units of a municipal Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Galicia, NW Spain. Among all the substances considered, significant concentrations in the influent were only found for the two musks (galaxolide and tonalide), two anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen and naproxen), two natural estrogens (estrone, 17beta-estradiol), one antibiotic (sulfaniethoxazole) and the X-ray contrast medium (iopromide), where the other compounds studied were below the limit of quantification. In the primary treatment, only the fragrances (30-50%) and 17beta-estradiol (20%) were partially removed. On the other hand, the aerobic treatment (activated sludges) caused an important reduction in all compounds detected, between 351/4 and 75%, with the exception of iopromide, which remained in the aqueous phase. The overall removal efficiencies within the STP ranged between 70-90% for the fragrances, 40-65% for the anti-inflammatories, around 65% for 17beta-estradiol and 60% for sulfamethoxazole. However, the concentration of estrone increased along the treatment due to the partial oxidation of 17beta-estradiol in the aeration tank. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In hospitals a large variety of substances are in use for medical purposes such as diagnostics and research. After application, diagnostic agents, disinfectants and excreted non-metabolized pharmaceuticals by patients reach the wastewater. Indeed, some of the substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be a possible cause of the cancers observed in the last decades. Genotoxicity tests are an excellent means to study the toxicity and the risk associated with these releases. This paper points out the areas of concern for hospital wastewater disposal and reports the findings of genotoxicity tests for hospital effluents from 3 major hospitals in Delhi. namely All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Apollo and Escorts. Mutagenicity of hospital wastewaters from effluent treatment plants (before and after treatment) was studied. The results of this study show that the genotoxicity of hospital wastewaters is highly reduced after the treatment process. This study calls for establishment of advanced and effective effluent treatment plants in the hospitals, which are merely dumping the wastewaters in the municipal sewerage system. The results of this study call for further detailed study in this area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and phosphorus are pollutants that can cause a wide array of negative environmental impacts. Phosphorus is a regulated pollutant in many industrial countries, while PPCPs are widely unregulated. Many technologies designed to remove phosphorus from wastewater can remove PPCPs, therefore the purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of these technologies to also reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through meta-analysis, the authors use the PPCPs' risk quotient (RQ) to measure and compare the effectiveness of different wastewater treatment technologies. The RQ data are then applied via a case study that uses phosphorus effluent regulations to determine the ability of the recommended technologies to also mitigate PPCPs.
   Findings - The tertiary membrane bioreactor and nanofiltration processes recommended to remove phosphorus can reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 71 and 81 percent, respectively. The ultrafiltration technology was estimated to reduce the median RQ from PPCPs by 28 percent with no cost in addition to the costs expected under the current phosphorus effluent regulations. RQ reduction is expected with a membrane bioreactor and the cost of upgrading to this technology was found to be $11.76 per capita/year.
   Practical implications - The authors discuss the management implications, including watershed management, alternative PPCPs reduction strategies, and water quality trading.
   Originality/value - The evaluation of the co-management of priority and emerging pollutants illuminates how the removal of regulated pollutants from wastewater could significantly reduce the emission of unregulated PPCPs.

AB The potential ecological impact of disinfection by-products (DBPs) present in chlorinated wastewater effluents is not well understood. In this study, the chlorinated effluent of traditional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and advanced water reclamation plants (AWRPs) supplying highly-treated recycled water were analyzed for nitrosamines and trihalomethanes (THMs), and a battery of bioassays conducted to assess effluent toxicity. An increase in general toxicity from DBPs was revealed for all wastewaters studied using an in vitro bioluminescence assay. Examples of androgenic activity and estrogenic activity arising from DBPs at specific sampling sites were also observed. The in vivo model (Anemia franciscana) was generally not adversely affected by exposure to DBPs from any of the chlorinated wastewaters studied. The observed toxicity could not be related to the concentrations of THMs and nitrosamines present, indicating that DBPs not monitored in this study were responsible for this. This work highlights the complexity of DBPs mixtures formed in chlorinated wastewaters, illustrating that toxicity of wastewater DBPs cannot be predicted by chemical monitoring of THMs and nitrosamines. The results suggest bioassays may be particularly useful monitoring tools in assessing toxicity arising from DBPs of these complex waters. The research concludes that DBPs formed in the chlorinated wastewaters studied can be toxic and may have a deleterious impact on aquatic organisms that are exposed to them, and therefore, that chlorination or chlorination/dechlorination may not be adequate treatment strategies for the protection of receiving waters. Chlorinated wastewater toxicity (from DBPs) is not well-understood in the Australian context, and this study serves to advise regulators on this issue. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explored a novel process for wastewater treatment, i.e. microwave enhanced Fenton-like process. This novel process was introduced to treat high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater with initial COD loading of 49,912.5 mg L-1. Operating parameters were investigated and the optimal condition included as follows: microwave power was 300 W, radiation time was 6 min, initial pH was 4.42, H2O2 dosage was 1300 mg L-1 and Fe-2(SO4)(3) dosage was 4900 mg L-1, respectively. Within the present experimental condition used, the COD removal and UV254 removal reached to 57.53% and 55.06%, respectively, and BOD5/COD was enhanced from 0.165 to 0.470. The variation of molecular weight distribution indicated that both macromolecular substances and micromolecular substances were eliminated quite well. The structure of flocs revealed that one ferric hydrated ion seemed to connect with another ferric hydrated ion and/or organic compound molecule to form large-scale particles by means of van der waals force and/or hydrogen bond. Subsequently, these particles aggregated to form flocs and settled down. Comparing with traditional Fenton-like reaction and conventional heating assisted Fenton-like reaction, microwave enhanced Fenton-like process displayed superior treatment efficiency. Microwave was in favor of improving the degradation efficiency, the settling quality of sludge, as well as reducing the yield of sludge and enhancing the biodegradability of effluent. Microwave enhanced Fenton-like process is believed to be a promising treatment technology for high concentration and biorefractory wastewater. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE nanofiltration; ozonation; pharmaceutical residuals; wastewater reuse
AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of nanofiltration (NF) and ozonation for indirect potable reuse in terms of pharmaceutical residuals. To simultaneously obtain a reasonable retentate volume for further treatment, the tests were performed at a high volume reduction factor (VRF) of 60. The feed to the pilot plant was the effluent from a BNR plant with a final process step of chemical precipitation and rapid sand filtration. Two tests were performed 1) nanofiltration of treated wastewater followed by ozonation and 2) ozonated treated wastewater as feed to NF. Of the 95 pharmaceuticals analysed, three were not removed to the quantification limit, oxazepam in the first test and glibenclamide and ketoprofen in the second. The water quality after the two processes was similar, with an overall removal of pharmaceutical residuals of 99%. There are two advantages of ozonated water as feed to NF-a higher specific flux of 35% and a potential removal of ozonation by-products. The retention of some pharmaceuticals by NF was lower than anticipated, the major removal occurring in the ozonation. A tighter NF or RO is required in order to achieve higher pharmaceutical retention for further treatment of the retentate.

AB The rate constants of the reactions of O-3 with some typical wastewater pollutants (tributyltin, the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin, the beta blocker metoprolol and the analgesic diclofenac) were determined and some mechanistic aspects were elucidated. Except for tributyltin compounds that react only slowly with O-3 (k = 4-7 M-1 s(-1)), the compounds react fast (k > 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) and can be eliminated at low O-3 doses. Clarithromycin reacts at its dimethylamino group and yields the corresponding N-oxide that is no longer biologically active. The nitrogen is also the major site of O-3 attack in diclofenac and in metoprolol. This gives rise to center dot OH radicals and these are the precursors of hydroxylated products and markedly contribute to chloride release in diclofenac.

AB Leaky sewers affect urban groundwater by the exfiltration of untreated wastewater. However, the impact of sewer exfiltration on the groundwater is poorly understood. Most studies on sewer exfiltration focus on water exfiltration, but not on the impact on groundwater quality. In this paper we present a new monitoring approach to estimate mass flow rates M-ex of different wastewater indicators (WWIs) from leaky sewers by applying integral pumping tests (IPTs). The problem of detecting and assessing heterogeneous concentrations in the vicinity of leaky sewers can be overcome with the IPT approach by the investigation of large groundwater volumes up- and downstream of leaky sewers. The increase in concentrations downstream of a leaky sewer section can be used to calculate M-ex with a numerical groundwater model. The new monitoring approach was first applied using four IPT wells in Leipzig (Germany). Over a pumping period of five days we sampled five inorganic WWIs: B, Cl-, K+, NO3-, NH4+ and three xenobiotics: bisphenol-a, caffeine and tonalide. The resulting concentration-time series indicated an influence of wastewater at one IPT well downstream of the leaky sewer. We defined ranges of M-ex by implementing the uncertainty of chemical analyses. The results showed a M-ex of 0-10.9 g m(-1) d(-1). The combination Of M-ex with wastewater concentrations from the target sewer yielded an exfiltration rate Q(ex) of 28.0-63.9 Lm(-1) d(-1) for the conservative ion Cl-. Most non-conservative WWIs showed reduced mass flow rates in the groundwater downstream of the leaky sewer that indicate a mass depletion during their passage from the sewer to the pumping well. Application of the IPT methodology at other field sites is possible. The IPT monitoring approach provides reliable M-ex values that can help to assess the impact of leaky sewers on groundwater.

AB The purpose of this work was to identify novel materials that could be used for the catalytic ozonation of wastewater for improved removal of micropollutants and disinfection. The materials chosen for investigation were selected based on their commercial availability and composition characteristics that suggested that they could act as catalysts. Synthetic wastewater (SWW) was used to mimic municipal secondary effluent wastewater while obtaining constant and reproducible matrix characteristics. Polonite (R), wollastonite, zeolite, TiO2-Al2O3 (8%/92%), and AL-1010S (AlO2-based) were tested for their potential impact on efficiency of disinfection, based on the removal of E. coli bacteria and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), relative to conventional ozonation. Atrazine (ATZ), ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), and gemfibrozil (GBZ) were used as indicator compounds. Zeolite and wollastonite did not promote disinfection and CECs removal; TiO2-Al2O3 and AL-1010S provided improvement for both criteria, but to a lesser extent in SWW than in Milli-Q water; and Polonite (R) did not enhance the removal of CECs but led to the higher E. coli inactivation. These results suggest that Polonite (R), AL-1010S, and TiO2-Al2O3 can act as catalysts and provide mechanisms to lower the ozone dose required to reach disinfection. The apparent kinetic constant of the reaction for the catalytic ozonation of ATZ, in the ultrapure water, was determined for Polonite (R), TiO2-Al2O3 and AL-1010S. The reusability of the catalysts was demonstrated over four consecutive cycles of 6 h of treatment in a continuous flow ozonation system. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The interest in the presence of pharmaceutical compounds (PhC) in the environment has increased significantly because of their potential impact on human health. Many studies have demonstrated that PhCs can be found in hospital and municipal wastewaters, mainly due to the inefficiency of the treatment plants. However, the question is how significant the hospital contribution represents in the total municipal wastewater generated. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to perform a comparison between hospital and municipal wastewaters based on literature review, serving as a base for the implementation of more efficient management policies in hospitals and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Results indicate that there are some compounds found in higher concentrations in hospital effluents than in municipal inffluent, particularly the class of antibiotics.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceutical micropollutants in aquatic environments has been one amongst serious environmental problems. During this study, two reactors, including a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) + powdered composite adsorbent (CA) (first reactor, SBR + CA) and a sequencing batch reactor (second reactor, SBR), were designed to treat synthetic wastewater. Powdered CA was added with a dosage of 4.8 g L-1 to the first reactor. Tap water was contaminated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia and three pharmaceuticals, namely, atenolol (ATN), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and diazepam (DIA) to produce synthetic wastewater. The SBR + CA illustrated a better performance during synthetic municipal wastewater treatment. Up to 138.6 mg L-1 (92.4%) of COD and up to 114.2 mg L-1 (95.2%) of ammonia were removed by the first reactor. Moreover, optimisation of pharmaceuticals removal was conducted through response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Based on the RSM, the best elimination of ATN (90.2%, 2.26 mg L-1), CIP (94.0%, 2.35 mg L-1) and DIA (95.5%, 2.39 mg L-1) was detected at the optimum initial concentration of MPs (2.51 mg L-1) and the contact time (15.8 h). In addition, ANN represented a high R-2 value ( 0.99) and a rational mean squared error (<1.0) during the optimisation of micropollutants removal by both reactors. Moreover, adsorption isotherm study showed that the Freundlich isotherm could justify the abatement of micropollutants by using CA better than the Langmuir isotherm.

AB The removal of micropollutants from municipal wastewater is challenged by the number of compounds with diverse physico-chemical properties. Ozonation is increasingly used to remove micropollutants from wastewater. However, ozonation does not necessarily result in complete mineralization of the organic micropollutants but rather transforms them into new compounds which could be persistent or have adverse environmental effects. To explore ozone dose dependency of the formation and successive removal of ozonation products, two pilot-scale and one full-scale ozonation plants were operated subsequent to a conventional activated sludge treatment. The results from these trials indicated that the concentrations of several N-oxides, such as Erythromycin N-oxide, Venlafaxine N-oxide and Tramadol N-oxide, increased up to an ozone dose of 0.56-0.61 mg O-3/mg DOC while they decreased at elevated doses of 0.7-1.0 mg O-3/mg DOC. Similar results were also obtained for two transformation products of Diclofenac (Diclofenac 2,5-quinone imine and 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)indolin-2,3-dione) and one transformation product of Carbamazepine (1-(2-benzoic acid)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione), where the highest concentrations appeared around 0.27-0.31 mg O-3/mg DOC. The formation maximum of a given compound occurred at a specific ozone dose that is characteristic for each compound, but seemed to be independent of the wastewater used for the experiments at the two pilots and the full-scale plant.

AB Pharmaceutical residuals are increasingly detected in natural waters, which made great threat to the health of the public. This study evaluated the utility of the photo-Fenton ceramic membrane filtration toward the removal and degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as a model recalcitrant micropollutant. The photo-Fenton catalyst Goethite (alpha-FeOOH) was coated on planar ceramic membranes as we reported previously. The removal of SMX in both simulated and real toilet wastewater were assessed by filtering the feed solutions with/without H2O2 and UV irradiation. The SMX degradation rate reached 87% and 92% respectively in the presence of UV/H2O2 for the original toilet wastewater (0.8 +/- 0.05 ppb) and toilet wastewater with a spiked SMX concentration of 100 ppb. The mineralization and degradation by-products were both assessed under different degradation conditions to achieve deeper insight into the degradation mechanisms during this photo-Fenton reactive membrane filtration. Results showed that a negligible removal rate (e.g., 3%) of SMX was obtained when only filtering the feed solution through uncoated or catalyst-coated membranes. However, the removal rates of SMX were significantly increased to 67% (no H2O2) and 90% (with H2O2) under UV irradiation, respectively, confirming that photo-Fenton reactions played the key role in the degradation/mineralization process. The highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) reached up to approximately 27% when the H2O2 was 10 mmolL(-1) and UV254 intensity was 100 mu W?cm(-2). This study lays the groundwork for reactive membrane filtration to tackle the issues from micropollution.

AB Spreading organic waste products (OWP) issued from sewage sludge or manures into soil may disseminate antibiotics with unknown risks for human health and environment. Our objectives were to compare the fate of two sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its metabolite N-acetyl-sulfa-methoxazole (N-ac-SMX), and one fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin (CIP), in an unamended soil, and two soils regularly amended since 1998 with a sewage sludge and green waste compost and with farmyard manure respectively. Incubations of soil spiked with C-14 labelled SMX or N-ac-SMX (0.02 mg kg(-1)) or CIP (0.15 mg kg(-1)) allowed a quantification of radiolabeled molecules in the mineralized, easily, hardly and non-extractable fractions after 3 and 156 days. Nature of C-14 molecules was also analyzed by HPLC in extractable fractions after 3 and 156 days.
   SMX and N-ac-SMX dissipation was fast and due to i) mineralization (similar to 10% of recovered C-14 after 156 days) or incomplete degradation (production of metabolites), ii) adsorption, even if both sulfonamides present low Kd (<3 L kg(-1)) and iii) formation of non-extractable residues (NER), representing more than 50% of recovered radioactivity.
   N-ac-SMX was more mineralized than SMX, and formed more progressively NER, after a step of deacetylation. Adsorption of CIP was fast and formed mainly NER (>72%) whereas its mineralization was negligible. Repeated applications of OWP tend to enhance adsorption of antibiotics and lower their degradation, through the quantity and quality of the built up soil organic matter. If applications of sewage sludge compost favor adsorption and inhibit mineralization, applications of manure boost the formation of non -extractable residues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The increased volume of produced toxic sewage sludge requires suitable management and utilization. Biochar production is an eco-efficient technology that uses toxic wastes towards highly efficient materials in pharmaceuticals removal from water. The management of sewage sludge towards engineered biochar can solve several problems: waste volume minimalization and obtaining of the novel highly efficient sorbents. The objective of this work was an evaluation of the affinity of sewage sludge-derived biochars towards selected pharmaceuticals in water systems. In order to achieve high specific surface area and high carbon content of biochar different carrier gas conditions, preparation temperatures and different raw materials were tested. The maximum adsorption capacity was following: diclofenac - 92.7 mg/g; triclosan - 113 mg/g and naproxen - 127 mg/g. The best fitting of the experimental results revealed mainly pseudo-second order model. The adsorption of diclofenac can occur via pi-stacking interactions with the biochar surface mainly via Dubinin-Radushkevich model. Both interactions between the phenyl groups of triclosan molecules and phenol groups on biochar via hydrogen bonding, and non-covalent pi-pi stacking of aromatic groups of triclosan and biochar were responsible for monolayer surface coverage. The adsorption of naproxen was ascribed to Langmuir, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich models and strong pi-pi electro-donor-acceptor interactions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater contributes a significant input of pharmaceuticals into municipal wastewater. The combination of suspended activated sludge and biofilm processes, as stand-alone or as hybrid process (hybrid biofilm and activated sludge system(Hybas T)) has been suggested as a possible solution for hospital wastewater treatment. To investigate the potential of such a hybrid system for the removal of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater a pilot plant consisting of a series of one activated sludge reactor, two Hybas T reactors and one moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) has been established and adapted during 10 months of continuous operation. After this adaption phase batch and continuous experiments were performed for the determination of degradation of pharmaceuticals. Removal of organic matter and nitrification mainly occurred in the first reactor. Most pharmaceuticals were removed significantly. The removal of pharmaceuticals (including X-ray contrast media, beta-blockers, analgesics and antibiotics) was fitted to a single first-order kinetics degradation function, giving degradation rate constants from 0 to 1.49 h(-1), from 0 to 7.78 x 10(-1) h(-1), from 0 to 7.86 x 10(-1) h(-1) and from 0 to 1.07 x 10(-1) h(-1) for first, second, third and fourth reactors respectively. Generally, the highest removal rate constants were found in the first and third reactors while the lowest were found in the second one. When the removal rate constants were normalized to biomass amount, the last reactor (biofilm only) appeared to have the most effective biomass in respect to removing pharmaceuticals. In the batch experiment, out of 26 compounds, 16 were assessed to degrade more than 20% of the respective pharmaceutical within the Hybas T train. In the continuous flow experiments, the measured removals were similar to those estimated from the batch experiments, but the concentrations of a few pharmaceuticals appeared to increase during the first treatment step. Such increase could be attributed to de-conjugation or formation from other metabolites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, there has been an increased interest in bridging the knowledge gap in the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in African urban water cycles. In this study, the occurrence of 7 antibiotics and 3 antiretrovirals in source-separated urine, groundwater, wastewater and surface water of the pen-urban area of Chunga in Lusaka, Zambia, was studied. In groundwater, the pharmaceuticals were only sporadically present with 4 antibiotics and 1 antiretroviral detected. The concentration of the antibiotics ranged from below limit of quantification (<LOQ) to 880 ng/L, with sulfamethoxazole having the highest detection frequency of 423%. In the surface water, a comparatively high concentration of pharmaceuticals was measured with concentrations ranging from <LOQ-11 800 ng/L to LOQ-49 700 ng/L for antibiotics and antiretroviral drugs, respectively. Similarly, the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent waters ranged from 100-33 300 ng/L and 80-30 040 ng/L, respectively. The concentration of the antiretrovirals was also relatively high in the wastewater and ranged from 680-118 970 ng/L and 1 720-55 760 ng/L in the influent and effluent, respectively. The concentration of the target analytes in source-separated urine were several orders of magnitude higher than in wastewater. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and la miv udine had the highest concentrations, of 7 740 mu g/L, 12 800 mu g/L and 10 010 mu g/L, respectively. The high concentration detected in source-separated urine calls for precautionary measures to be undertaken when such urine is to be used as a fertilizer. However, urine source separation has a major advantage of pooling a significant proportion of excreted pharmaceuticals into small manageable volumes which can be effectively treated, minimizing environmental contamination. The high concentrations of antibiotics and antiretroviral drugs measured in this study necessitate creation of effective barriers to mitigate the possible environmental and human health risks.

AB It is shown here that ZVI-Fenton is a suitable technique to achieve effective degradation of ibuprofen and phenol under several operational conditions. Degradation of ibuprofen was possible in the pH interval 3-6 in both synthetic laboratory systems and actual wastewater (secondary treatment effluent), but operation at the higher pH values required higher H2O2 concentration and/or higher ZVI loading. In the case of real wastewater we offset the lower degradation efficiency, caused by the occurrence of organic and inorganic interfering agents, by carrying out multiple H2O2 additions. The studied wastewater sample had a buffer-capacity minimum at pH 4-5, and optimal treatment for ibuprofen degradation might take place at either pH 4 or 6. With a reagents cost in the order of 0.06-0.10 $ m(-3), the technique appears as very competitive and promising for tertiary wastewater treatment. There is a clear trade-off between savings in pH-fixing reagents and higher consumption of ZVI-Fenton reagents at the different pH values. The final choice in real application scenarios could be based on cost considerations (which favour pH 4) and/or the eventual fate of wastewater. For instance, wastewater reuse might place requirements on the salinity that is increased by the acidification/neutralization steps: in this case, operation at pH 6 is preferred. Interestingly, the ZVI-Fenton degradation of ibuprofen led to very low generation of toxic 4-isobutylacetophenone (IBAP, which is the ibuprofen by-product raising the highest concern), because of the combination of low formation yields and limited IBAP stability in the optimal reaction conditions. In addition to ibuprofen, phenol could be degraded as well by ZVI-Fenton. Interestingly, the ability of ZVI-Fenton to degrade both ibuprofen and phenol under similar conditions might open up the way to apply this technique to additional pollutants as well as to pollutant mixtures.

AB The aim of the study was to present first preliminary characterization of Turkish hospital wastewaters, their environmental risk, and a method for toxicity assessment. The hospital wastewater samples were collected from two of the largest medical faculty hospitals and a training and research hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. The samples from the selected hospitals were taken as grab samples on March 2014. Overall, 55 substances including pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, pesticides, and corrosion inhibitors were analyzed in all hospital wastewaters. Analysis of toxicity and the antibiotic resistance bacteria were investigated in addition to the chemical analysis in the wastewater of one hospital. Hazard quotients (HQs) and toxic units (TUs) were calculated as basis of the environmental risk assessment. Fourteen pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater (HWW) were classified as "high risk" with HQ > 10. HQ(HWW) values higher than 100 were determined for five antibiotics and one analgesic, namely, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfapyridine, trimethoprim, and diclofenac. Ofloxacin with an HQ(HWW) of 9090 was observed to be the most hazardous compound. HQ and TU values of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent dropped significantly due to dilution in the sewer. Further elimination by biological degradation or adsorption was observed only in some cases. However, the decreased HQ(WWTPeffluent) values do not the change environmental load significantly. Therefore, advanced treatment processes should be applied to remove the persistent compounds. In combination with the results on antibiotic resistance, we would prefer on-site treatment of hospital wastewater. Toxicological assessment was performed using cytotoxic and mutagenic screening tests. The results of the Ames assay showed that the native hospital wastewaters had strongly mutagenic activity with a <= 10-fold increase relative to negative controls. The mutagenic potentials of the samples were generally concentration and metabolic activation dependent. Multiple antibiotic resistances were demonstrated with the tested isolates to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, and ceftazidime. This study demonstrates that the hospital wastewaters in Istanbul exhibit strong environmental and toxicological risks, as well as high multiple drug resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

AB This study was performed to remove emerging contaminants ibuprofen (IBU) and ketoprofen (KETO), COD and nitrogen compounds from pharmaceutical wastewater. The ASSBR was operated under a constant aeration rate at 1.0 L/min, 24 h HRT and various loadings of IBU (1.71-5.1 mg/m(3) day), KETO (0.39-2.1 mg/m(3) day), COD (1.2-10 kg/m(3) day) and ammonia (NH3-N: 4.3-6.3 g/m(3) day). The results showed that IBU, KETO, COD, NH3-N and nitrate (NO3-N) were efficiently removed in the range of 63-90%, 13-92%, 88.7-89.3%, 77.2-96%, 35.7-92.5%, respectively. Isolation and screening of effective microbes found three isolates identified as Bacillus pseudomycoides, Rhodococcus ruber and Vibrio mediterranei, which had a higher toxicity resistance towards IBU and KETO. Thus, the pharmaceutical wastewater especially IBU and KETO could be biologically removed with the presents of valuable effective microbes in the ASSBR system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nowadays, pharmaceuticals are found in every compartment of the environment. Hospitals are one of the main sources of these pollutant emissions sent to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that are poorly equipped to treat these types of compounds efficiently. In this work, for each pharmaceutical compound found in hospital wastewater (HWW), we have calculated a hazard quotient (HQ) corresponding to the highest concentration measured in HWW divided by its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Thus we have assessed the contribution of each compound to the ecotoxicological threat of HWW taken as a whole. Fifteen compounds are identified as particularly hazardous in HWW. In future more attention should be given to their analysis and replacement in hospitals, and to their elimination in WWTPs. This work also highlights the lack of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of certain pharmaceutical compounds found in HWW at high concentrations (mg L-1). In order to extend this study, it is now necessary to investigate ecotoxic risks linked to various emission scenarios, focusing in particular on dilution in the aquatic environment and the production of metabolites, especially during transit inside WWTPs.

AB Anaerobic and aerobic treatment of high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater was evaluated in this study. A batch test was performed to study the biodegradability of the wastewater, and the result indicated that a combination anaerobic-aerobic treatment system was effective in removing organic matter from the high-strength pharmaceutical wastewater. Based on the batch test, a pilot-scale system composed of an anaerobic baffled reactor followed by a biofilm airlift suspension reactor was designed. At a stable operational period, effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the anaerobic baffled reactor ranged from 1,432 to 2,397 mg/L at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.25 day, and 979 to 1,749 mg/L at an HRT of 2.5 day, respectively, when influent COD ranged from 9,736 to 19,862 mg/L. As a result, effluent COD of the biofilm airlift suspension reactor varied between 256 and 355 mg/L at HRTs of from 5.0 to 12.5 h. The antibiotics ampicillin and aureomycin, with influent concentrations of 3.2 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively, could be partially degraded in the anaerobic baffled reactor: ampicillin and aureomycin removal efficiencies were 16.4 and 25.9% with an HRT of 1.25 day, and 42.1 and 31.3% with HRT of 2.5 day, respectively. Although effective in COD removal, the biofilm airlift suspension reactor did not display significant antibiotic removal, and the removal efficiencies of the two antibiotics were less than 10%.

AB Wastewater treatment plant effluents from urban area are a well-known source of chronic multiple micropollution to the downstream living organisms. In this study, ecologically relevant laboratory-bred freshwater gastropods, Lymnaea stagnalis, were exposed for 29 days to raw effluents of a wastewater treatment plant in Lyon area (France). A time-course analysis of individual markers of immunocompetence (hemocyte density and viability, hemocyte NADPH activity, phenol oxidase activity, and capacity of phagocytosis) has shown slight trends of inflammatory-like responses induced by the 100% effluents. So far, no short-term hazard for L. stagnalis can be revealed. However, over the long term, such environmental stress-stimulating immune responses could provoke deleterious life history trade-offs because the immune system is known to be highly energy-consuming.

AB Marine sediment quality of wastewater discharges areas was determined by using in situ caged clams Ruditapes philippinarum taking into account the seasonality. Clams were caged in sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges at four sites (P1, P2, P3, P4) at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain), and one reference site (P6). Exposure to contaminated sediments was confirmed by measurement of metals and As, PAH, pharmaceutical products and surfactants (SAS) in bottom sediments. Biological effects were determined by following biomarkers of exposure (activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase - EROD, dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase - DBF, glutathione S-transferase - GST, glutathione peroxidase - GPX, glutathione reductase - GR and acetylcholinesterase - AChE), effects (lysosomal membrane stability - LMS, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation - LPO), energy status (total lipids TIT and mitochondrial electron transport MET), and involved in the mode of action of pharmaceutical products (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO, alkali-labile phosphates - ALP levels and cyclooxygenase activity COX). In winter, urban effluents were detoxified by phase I biotransformation (CYP3A-like activity), phase II (GST), and the activation of antioxidant defence enzymes (GR). Urban effluents lead to the detoxification metabolism (CYP1A-like), oxidative effects (LPO and DNA damage), neurotoxicity (AChE) and neuroendocrine disruption (COX and ALP levels) involved in inflammation (P1 and P2) and changes in reproduction as spawning delay (P3 and P4) in clams exposed in summer. Adverse effects on biota exposed to sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges depend on the chemical contamination level and also on the reproductive cycle according to seasonality.

AB Wastewater from a pharmaceutical formulation facility (TevaKS, Israel) was treated with a biological activated-sludge system followed by ozonation. The goal was to reduce the concentrations of the drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and venlafaxine (VLX) before discharging the wastewater to the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Both drugs were detected at extremely high concentrations in TevaKS raw wastewater ([VLX] = 11.72 +/- 2.2 mg/L, [CBZ] = 0.84 +/- 0.19 mg/L), and resisted the biological treatment. Ozone efficiently degraded CBZ: at an 03 dose-to-dissolved organic carbon ratio of 0.55 (O-3/DOC), the concentration of CBZ was reduced by >99%. A lower removal rate was observed for VLX, which was decreased by similar to 98% at the higher O-3/DOC ratio of 0.87. Decreasing the pH of the biologically treated effluent from 7 to 5 significantly increased the ozone degradation rate of CBZ, while decreasing the degradation rate of VLX. Ozone treatment did not alter the concentration of the effluent's DOC and filtered chemical oxygen demand (CODf). However, a significant increase was recorded (following ozonation) in the effluent's biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and the BOD5/CODf ratio. This implies an increase in the effluent's biodegradability, which is highly desirable if ozonation is followed by a domestic biological treatment. Different organic byproducts were formed following ozone reaction with the target pharmaceuticals and with the effluent organic matter; however, these byproducts are expected to be removed during biological treatment in the municipal WWTP.

AB Discharge of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments can lead to serious negative envi-ronmental effects. While traditional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are efficient for a wide range of non-toxic pollutants (i.e. ammonia), some wastewater streams contain recalcitrant toxic trace micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals that cannot be removed by the treatment processes that are typically employed in common WWTPs. Herein, an innovative 20 L microbial electrochemical ultraviolet photolysis cell (MEUC) was developed for the first time by the integration of a UV irradiation and a bioelectrochemical system, which exhibited efficient treatment of carbamazepine-a model pharmaceutical compound. Notably, neither the UV irradiation nor the bioelectrochemical system alone could effectively eliminate carbamazepine. The effect of operational parameters including applied voltage, cathodic aeration rate, UV intensity, and hydraulic retention time were evaluated. The obtained results elucidated that the degradation of carbamazepine was consistent with pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, and required a lower energy input than traditional advanced oxidation processes. Five main transformation products were identified, and probable transformation pathways were established. Furthermore, the eco-toxicity as tested by Vibrio fischeri showed no significant bioluminescence inhibition by the treated carbamazepine effluent. Finally, the MEUC system was further tested with a real wastewater matrix, which again exhibited effective removal of carbamazepine. This paper provides a proof-of-concept verification of the novel MEUC system, which contributes insight for the subsequent vigorous development of the application of such efficient and cost-effective technologies for the treatment of trace pharmaceuticals wastewater.

AB Conventional treatment technologies applied in wastewater treatment plants are not efficient to remove pharmaceuticals from effluents. Consequently, the ever-growing presence of these emerging contaminants in aquatic environments has been reported. There is great concern about their potential adverse effects on organisms, and increasing interest in technologies to minimize these effects. More efficient technologies are needed to solve these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of two wastewater tertiary treatments. A mixture of 9 pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, norfloxacin, metoprolol, caffeine, antipyrine, sulfamethoxazole, ketorolac, hydroxybiphenyl and diclofenac at 10 mg L-1 each) was added to a wastewater sample to further be ozonated and subjected to photocatalytic oxidation (black-light radiation/TiO2/O-2) for different time regimes (30 and 120 min). Resultant effluents were assessed for chemical efficacy (total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand) and toxicity (through a zebrafish embryo-larval bioassay including mortality and sublethal effects). Ozonation (120 min) and photocatalytic oxidation (30 min and 120 min) were effective processes to decrease both total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), with the latter under Directive 91/271/CEE recommended values. However, only the effluent subjected to 120 min photocatalytic oxidation was actually safe for the embryo-larval development and its functionality, with behavioral effects as the most sensitive endpoint. Thus, the toxic response of the zebrafish embryo-larval model proved to be more sensitive than the effluent physical-chemical monitoring itself, providing a tool to better characterize wastewater suitability.

AB Transformation of biomarkers (or their stability) during sewer transport is an important issue for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Most studies so far have been conducted in the laboratory, which usually employed unrealistic conditions. In the present study, we utilized a pilot sewer system including a gravity pipe and a rising main pipe to investigate the fate of 24 pharmaceutical biomarkers. A programmable logic controller was used to control and monitor the system including sewer operational conditions and wastewater properties. Sequential samples were collected that can represent hydraulic retention time (HRT) of up to 8 h in a rising main and 4 h in a gravity sewer. Wastewater parameters and biomarker concentrations were analysed to evaluate the stability and transformation kinetics. The wastewater parameters of the pilot system were close to the conditions of real sewers. The findings of biomarker transformation were also close to real sewer data with seventeen biomarkers reported as stable while buprenorphine, caffeine, ethyl-sulfate, methadone, paracetamol, paraxanthine and salicylic acid degraded to variable extents. Both zero-order and first-order kinetics were used to model the degradation of unstable biomarkers and interestingly the goodness of fit R-2 for the zero-order model was higher than the first-order model for all unstable biomarkers in the rising main. The pilot sewer system simulates more realistic conditions than benchtop laboratory setups and may provide a more accurate approach for assessing the in-sewer transformation kinetics and stability of biomarkers.

AB The degradation of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in a municipal wastewater treated by ozonation was characterized using the methods of high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and excitation/emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The removal of 40 diverse trace-level contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) present in the wastewater was determined as well. Ozonation caused a rapid decrease of the absorbance and fluorescence of the wastewater, which was associated primarily with the oxidation of high and low apparent molecular weight (AMW) EfOM fractions. PARAFAC analysis also showed that components C1 and C2 decreased prominently in these conditions. The EfOM fraction of intermediate molecular weight ascribable to a terrestrial humic-like component (C3) tended to be less reactive toward ozone. Relative changes of EEM fluorescence were quantified using F (max) values of PARAFAC-identified components (a dagger F/F (0) (max)). Unambiguous relationships between a dagger F/F (0) (max) values and the extent of the degradation of the examined CECs (a dagger C/C-0) were established. This allowed correlating main parameters of the a dagger C/C-0 vs. a dagger F/F (0) (max) relationships with the rates of oxidation of these CECs. The results demonstrate the potential of online measurements of EEM fluorescence for quantitating effects of ozonation on EfOM and micropollutants in wastewater effluents.

AB Septic tanks and other on-site systems are a common means of disposing domestic wastewater effluent in Ireland. In assessing site suitability, subsoils below the percolation trench have an important role in attenuating pollutants and hence in protecting groundwater. As part of an investigation into the hydraulic performance of treatment systems at four sites in Ireland with different subsoil characteristics, a series of samples were analysed for endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including oestrogens, surfactants and organic oxygen compounds. EDCs were found at all four sites, but only at low concentrations (often below those at which their presence could be confirmed) and generally only in samples known to be percolating effluent. Further research should target oestrogen compounds, as these appear to be present in higher concentrations than the other EDCs and also have greater potency.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in surface waters worldwide, raising concerns about effects on aquatic organisms. Analyses of pharmaceuticals in blood plasma of fish could provide means to assess risk for pharmacological effects, as these concentrations could be compared with available human therapeutic plasma levels. In this study we investigated if fish exposed to sewage effluents have plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals that are approaching human therapeutic levels. We also evaluated how well the bioconcentration of pharmaceuticals into fish blood plasma can be predicted based on lipophilicity. Rainbow trout were exposed to undiluted, treated sewage effluents at three sites in Sweden for 14 days. Levels of 25 pharmaceuticals in blood plasma and effluents were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. The progestin pharmaceutical levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations (8.5-12 ng mL(-1)), exceeding the human therapeutic plasma level. In total 16 pharmaceuticals were detected in fish plasma at concentrations higher than 1/1000 of the human therapeutic plasma concentration. Twenty-one pharmaceuticals were detected in either plasma or effluent, and 14 were detected in both compartments, allowing plasma bioconcentration factors to be determined. For 11 of these, theoretically calculated and experimentally measured values were in reasonably good agreement. However a few drugs, including levonorgestrel, did not bioconcentrate according to the screening model used. This study shows that rainbow trout exposed to sewage effluents have blood plasma levels of pharmaceuticals similar to human therapeutic concentrations, suggesting a risk for pharmacological effects in the fish. There is a particular concern about effects of progestin pharmaceuticals. For levonorgestrel, the measured effluent level (1 ng/L) was higher than water levels shown to reduce the fertility of fish.

AB The widely used artificial sweetener acesulfame K has long been considered recalcitrant in biological wastewater treatment. Due to its persistence and mobility in the aquatic environment, acesulfame has been used as marker substance for wastewater input in surface water and groundwater. However, recent studies indicated that the potential to remove this xenobiotic compound is emerging in wastewater treatment plants worldwide, leading to decreasing mass loads in receiving waters despite unchanged human consumption patterns. Here we show evidence that acesulfame can be mineralized in a catabolic process and used as sole carbon source by bacterial pure strains isolated from activated sludge and identified as Bosea sp. and Chelatococcus sp. The strains mineralize 1 g/L acesulfame K within 8-9 days. We discuss the potential degradation pathway and how this novel catabolic trait confirms the "principle of microbial infallibility." Once the enzymes involved in acesulfame degradation and their genes are identified, it will be possible to survey diverse environments and trace back the evolutionary origin as well as the mechanisms of global distribution and establishment of such a new catabolic trait.

AB Membrane distillation (MD) was evaluated as a treatment option of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (WWROC) discharged from wastewater reclamation plants (WRPs). A direct contact MD (DCMD), at obtaining 85% water recovery of WWROC showed only 13-15% flux decline and produced good quality permeate (10-15 S/cm, 99% ion rejection) at moderate feed temperature of 55 degrees C. Prevalent calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposition on the MD membrane occurred in treating WWROC at elevated concentrations. The combination of low salinity and loose CaCO3 adhesion on the membrane did not significantly contribute to DCMD flux decline. Meanwhile, high organic content in WWROC (58-60 mg/L) resulted in a significant membrane hydrophobicity reduction (70% lower water contact angle than virgin membrane) attributed to low molecular weight organic adhesion onto the MD membrane. Granular activated carbon (GAC) pretreatment helped in reducing organic contents of WWROC by 46-50%, and adsorbed a range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic micropollutants. This ensured high quality water production by MD (micropollutants-free) and enhanced its reuse potential. The MD concentrated WWROC was suitable for selective ion precipitation, promising a near zero liquid discharge in WRPs.

AB Determining optimal ozone doses for organic micropollutant elimination during wastewater ozonation is challenged by the presence of a large number of structurally diverse micropollutants for varying wastewater matrice compositions. A chemical kinetics approach based on ozone and hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) rate constant and measurements of ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures is proposed to predict the micropollutant elimination efficiency. To further test and validate the chemical kinetics approach, the elimination efficiency of 25 micropollutants present in a hospital wastewater effluent from a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) were determined at pH 7.0 and 8.5 in bench-scale experiments with ozone alone and ozone combined with H2O2 as a function of DOC-normalized specific ozone doses (gO(3)/gDOC). Furthermore, ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures, (OH)-O-center dot yields, and (OH)-O-center dot consumption rates were determined. Consistent eliminations as a function of gO(3)/gDOC were observed for micropollutants with similar ozone and (OH)-O-center dot rate constants. They could be classified into five groups having characteristic elimination patterns. By increasing the pH from 7.0 to 8.5, the elimination levels increased for the amine-containing micropollutants due to the increased apparent second-order ozone rate constants while decreased for most micropollutants due to the diminished ozone or (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Increased (OH)-O-center dot quenching by effluent organic matter and carbonate with increasing pH was responsible for the lower (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Upon H2O2 addition, the elimination levels of the micropollutants slightly increased at pH 7 (<8%) while decreased considerably at pH 8.5 (up to 31%). The elimination efficiencies of the selected micropollutants could be predicted based on their ozone and (OH)-O-center dot rate constants (predicted or taken from literature) and the determined ozone and (OH)-O-center dot exposures. Reasonable agreements between the measured and predicted elimination levels were found, demonstrating that the proposed chemical kinetics method can be used for a generalized prediction of micropollutant elimination during wastewater zonation. Out of 67 analyzed micropollutants, 56 were present in the tested hospital wastewater effluent.

AB The increase in population and industrialization has led to increase wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Turkey's pharmaceutical sector has grown by over 30% in the last decade, therefore the levels of estrogenic hormones are also expected to increase in wastewater. When exposed from external sources, estrogenic hormones may cause endocrine disturbance. This paper assesses the levels of 17 beta-estradiol and estrone levels in treatment plants. A total 16 treatment plants and 4 water reservoirs were analysed for 17 beta-estradiol and estrone using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) test method. 17 beta-estradiol and estrone values were detected in the range of 37-382 ng/L and <1-187 ng/L, respectively. Pre-treatment plants had the highest levels estrogenic hormones, while reservoirs had the least levels.

In general, transformation efficiencies of CECs either increased or were retained at the higher ozone dose. The higher ozone dose of 0.72 mg O-3/mg DOC (Z(spec) = 0.6 mg O-3/mg DOC) was sufficient to transform 21 of the 31 detected CECs by over 80% as well as achieving the disinfection target of < 200 MPN E. coli per 100 mL.

AB This paper describes the performance characterization of the Extractive Membrane Bioreactor (EMB) when treating pharmaceutical industry process wastewater contaminated with Dichloromethane (DCM). EMB technology, which employs extraction and biodegradation in a single step, has proved a potential alternative for the treatment of harsh inorganic waste streams contaminated with organic compounds. It is particularly successful for the destruction of toxic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) such as DCM without incurring air-stripping. A mixed culture was enriched to achieve complete biodegradation of DCM and total mineralization was confirmed by measurement of stoichiometric chloride release. The laboratory scale EMB was fed the process wastewater without any pre-treatment or dilution and was operated for 16 days with removals >95% for the entire period of operation. The applicability of the EMB to treatment of a range of pharmaceutical industry wastewaters and its costs are discussed.

AB An inadequate and inefficient performance ability of conventional methods to remove persistent organic pollutants urges the need of alternative or complementary advanced wastewater treatments methods to ensure the safer reuse of reclaimed water. Photoelectrochemical methods are emerging as promising options among other advanced oxidation processes because of the higher treatment efficiency achieved due to the synergistic effects of combined photochemical and electrolysis reactions. Synergistic effects of integrated photochemical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes not only increase the hydroxyl radical production; an enhancement on the mineralization ability through various side reactions is also achieved. In this review, fundamental reaction mechanisms of different photoelectrochemical methods including photoelectrocatalysis, photo/solar electro-Fenton, photo anodic oxidation, photoelectroperoxone and photocatalytic fuel cell are discussed. Various integrated photochemical, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes and their synergistic effects are elaborated. Different reactor configurations along with the positioning of electrodes, photocatalysts and light source of the individual/combined photoelectrochemical treatment systems are discussed. Modified photoanode and cathode materials used in the photoelectrochemical reactors and their performance ability is presented. Photoelectrochemical treatment of real wastewater such as landfill leachate, oil mill, pharmaceutical, textile, and tannery wastewater are reviewed. Hydrogen production efficiency in the photoelectrochemical process is further elaborated. Cost and energy involved in these processes are briefed, but the applicability of photocatalytic fuel cells to reduce the electrical dependence is also summarised. Finally, the use of photoelectrochemical approaches as an alternative for treating soil washing effluents is currently discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The largely uncontrolled release of active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) within untreated wastewater discharged to waterbodies, associated with many rapidly urbanising centres is of growing concern owing to potential antimicrobial resistance, endocrine disruption and potential toxicity. A sampling campaign has been undertaken to assess the source, occurrence, magnitude and risk associated with APIs and other chemicals within the Nairobi/Athi river basin, in Kenya, East Africa. The catchment showed an extensive downstream impact zone estimated to extend 75 km, mostly, but not exclusively, derived from the direct discharge of untreated wastewater from the urban centre of Nairobi city. The exact extent of the downstream boundary of the Nairobi city impact zone was unclear owing to the inputs of untreated wastewater sources from the continuous urbanized areas along the river, which counteracted the natural attenuation caused by dilution and degradation. The most frequently detected APIs and chemicals were caffeine, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, nicotine, and sulfamethoxazole. Paracetamol, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim alone contributed 86% of the total amount of APIs determined along the Nairobi/Athi catchment. In addition to direct discharge of untreated domestic wastewater attributed to the informal settlements within the conurbation, other sources were linked to the industrial area in Nairobi City where drug formulation is known to occur, the Dandora landfill and veterinary medicines from upstream agriculture. It was shown that there was a possible environmental risk of API ecotoxicological effects beyond the end of the traditional impact zone defined by elevated biochemical oxygen demand concentrations; with metronidazole and sulfamethoxazole exhibiting the highest risk.

AB This study assessed the ability to remove micro-pollutants from wastewater using herbaceous species (Phragmites australis L.) and trees (Salix matsudana Koidz.) in constructed wetland (CW) systems. The targets of the study were as follows: (i) pharmaceuticals like diclofenac, ketoprofen, and atenolol; (ii) 4-n-NP (4-n-nonylphenol) and the ethoxylated derivatives monoethoxylated nonylphenol (NP1EO) and diethoxylated nonylphenol (NP2EO); (iii) triclosan, a bactericide used in personal care products. The 12 CW systems, filled with clay and gravel, were irrigated with wastewater from municipal area of Pagnana (Tuscany, Italy) and influent and effluent water samples analyzed periodically by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The removal efficiency of CWs planted with willow and common red ranged from 8.4 up to 100%, with the higher removal efficiency for triclosan. On the contrary, the removal efficiency of NPs and NPEOs appears lower than pharmaceuticals. Data demonstrated that P. australis efficiently removed NP, diclofenac, and atenolol, while S. matsudana preferentially removed NP1EO, NP2EO, ketoprofene, and triclosan. A specific selection of plants used in CWs could be exploited for the removal of specific xenobiotics from wastewater.

AB Fixed bed reactors with naturally attached biofilms are increasingly used for anaerobic treatment of industry wastewaters due their effective treatment performance. The complex nature of biological reactions in biofilm processes often poses difficulty in analyzing them experimentally, and mathematical models could be very useful for their design and analysis. However, effective application of biofilm reactor models to practical problems suffers due to the lack of knowledge of accurate kinetic models and uncertainty in model parameters. In this work, an inverse modeling approach based on ant colony optimization is proposed and applied to estimate the kinetic and film thickness model parameters of wastewater treatment process in an anaerobic fixed bed biofilm reactor. Experimental data of pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment process are used to determine the model parameters as a consequence of the solution of the rigorous mathematical models of the process. Results were evaluated for different modeling configurations derived from the combination of mathematical models, kinetic expressions, and optimization algorithms. Analysis of results showed that the two-dimensional mathematical model with Haldane kinetics better represents the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in the biofilm reactor. The mathematical and kinetic modeling of this work forms a useful basis for the design and optimization of industry wastewater treating biofilm reactors.

AB Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) has been shown to be an appropriate technology for the treatment of water containing toxic and hazardous substances, because it provides high destruction efficiencies. This paper reports a study of alternatives, and optimisation of various parameters and conditions, which are applied to the design of a mobile treatment unit. Phenol was selected as a model organic compound present in the feed stream and NaCl was selected as a model polar compound for solid separation. Pilot plant results show that efficiencies above 99.9% in phenol destruction are reached, at an operation temperature of about 650 degreesC, with stoichiometric amounts of air. Feed streams with a wide range of heating values (lower limit 530 and upper limit 930kJkg(-1)) can be handled, because these values allow both thermal and mechanical energy recoveries, which are the key factor for economic feasibility. The unit is capable of handling wastewater containing toxic, recalcitrant or nonbiodegradable compounds that cannot be treated with global streams at the wastewater treatment plant of a factory. It is specifically proposed for use in industries in which wastewater contains solvent mixtures of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals pose a challenge for water and wastewater treatment because they exist at very low concentrations in the presence of substances at much higher concentrations competing for adsorption sites. Sub-micron sized resin particles (approximately 300 nm in diameter) (SMR) were tested to evaluate their potential as a treatment for EDCs including: 17-beta estradiol (E2), 17-alpha ethinylestradiol (EE2), estrone (E1), bisphenol A (BPA), and diethylstilbestrol (DES) as well as 12 pharmaceuticals. SMR were able to remove 98% of spiked E2, 80% of EE2, 87% of BPA, and up to 97% of DES from water. For a 0.5 ppm mixture of E2, EE2, E1, BPA and DES, the minimum removal was 24% (E2) and the maximum was 49% (DES). They were also able to remove the pharmaceuticals from deionized water and wastewater. Overall, SMR are a promising advanced treatment for removal of both EDCs and pharmaceuticals.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive summary on modelling of micro-pollutants' (MPs) fate and transport in wastewater. It indicates the motivations of MP modelling and summarises and illustrates the current status. Finally, some recommendations are provided to improve and diffuse the use of such models. In brief, we conclude that, in order to predict the contaminant removal in centralised treatment works, considering the dramatic improvement in monitoring and detecting MPs in wastewater, more mechanistic approaches should be used to complement conventional, heuristic and other fate models. This is crucial, as regional risk assessments and model-based evaluations of pollution discharge from urban areas can potentially be used by decision makers to evaluate effluent quality regulation, and assess upgrading requirements, in the future.

AB Nano-sized CuInS2 was evenly anchored on the thin film of reduced graphene oxide (rGO/CuInS2) by a simple one-step solvothermal method. The photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 was much higher than that of pure CuInS2, and was highly dependant on rGO amount with results revealing an optimal rGO content of 1 wt%. The 1% rGO/CuInS2 composite demonstrated the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with almost 90% 2-nitrophenol removal, which was almost two times of pure CuInS2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 is ascribed to that the ultrathin film structure of rGO endows rGO/CuInS2 composites with a large density of exposed active sites to reactants, short transport distances of photogenerated charges and the efficient separation of charge carriers. Of special significance is that 1% rGO/CuInS2 composite can effectively treat real pharmaceutical wastewater with 86.5% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency in 11 h. Moreover, there was no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic activity of rGO/CuInS2 composites after four photocatalytic cycles. The high COD removal efficiency of pharmaceutical wastewater and reusability indicate the great potential of rGO/CuInS2 in environmental purification of organic pollutants.

AB The treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater was studied using granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, UV/H2O2 process, and their combination. Experimental results reveal that GAC adsorption alone has 79% efficiency in total organic carbon (TOC) removal in 10min breakthrough time with the dosage of 333.33mgactivated carbon/L. The adsorption data are fitted well with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The UV/H2O2 process alone at 6h hydraulic retention time with optimum dosage of 4.25mgH2O2/mgCOD shows 29 and 26% TOC reduction using 185 and 254nm UV lamps, respectively. The kinetic modelling of the UV254/H2O2 process is developed using chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TOC as lumped parameters. A good agreement between model predictions and experimental data is confirmed. In combined processes, pre-treated pharmaceutical wastewater by UV254/H2O2 followed by GAC adsorption process along with the desorption of contaminants from GAC and the subsequent treatment of the condensed steam by UV254/H2O2 process leads to 82 % TOC removal efficiency. On the other hand, the GAC adsorption along with UV254/H2O2 treatment of regenerant (condensed steam) from the desorption process leads to 88 % TOC removal at optimum conditions.

ID ANTIBIOTICS
AB Nowadays, antibiotics are considered as stable organic chemical compounds and their presence in hospital wastewater, pharmaceutical wastewaters and surface waters has led to some concerns. This study aimed to investigate the removal of penicillin as a pharmaceutical pollutant using Spirulina platensis and Chlorella vulgaris microalgae from aqueous solution. This study was carried out on synthetic samples at laboratory scale and wastewater samples of two hospitals in Birjand city, Iran. In this research, the effect of parameters such as retention time, the effect of pH variables and initial concentration on the removal efficiency of penicillin antibiotic by two microalgae were investigated. The results of this study showed that by increasing the number and biomass of microalgae, the removal efficiency of penicillin antibiotic increases. The optimal pH for removal of penicillin was obtained for both algae as 7 or neutral. Furthermore, the contact time at 8 and 9 d were selected as optimal time for C. vulgaris and S. platensis, respectively. The use of microalgae in the main hospitals of Birjand city wastewater has been efficient in the removal of penicillin antibiotics. Therefore, this method can be effective for the removal of antibiotics with similar structure.

AB As freshwater sources continue to be influenced by wastewater effluents, there is a dire need to develop advanced water treatment processes capable of treating the wastewater-derived contaminants, especially for pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2) as an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to attenuate five widespread PhACs (carbamazepine (CBZ), primidone (PMD), phenobarbital (PBB), thiamphenicol (TAP) and florfenicol (FF)) was investigated in this paper. The degradation of these compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (R-2>0.96). The optimum CaO2 dosage was 0.1 g L-1 and lower initial contaminants concentration was beneficial to their degradation. The UV/CaO2 treatment of test PhACs was attributed to the combination of UV/H2O2 and UV-base-photolysis (UV/Ca(OH)(2)), and the degradation mechanism was recognized as both UV direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by reactive radicals (center dot OH, triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*), and O-1(2)). Furthermore, the tentative transformation pathways of the five PhACs were proposed based on the detected intermediates and the degradation mechanisms. The final products of inorganic carbon and nitrogen indicate UV/CaO2 treatment can significantly mineralize test PhACs. Also, the CaO2 addition significantly reduced the energy consumption of UV irradiation according to electrical energy per order. The effective removal of CBZ and PMD in a secondary wastewater effluent by UV/CaO2 treatment demonstrates the potential use of this AOP technology in advanced treatment of wastewater-derived PhACs.

AB The anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal, especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics. In this study, an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol (CAP) wastewater treatment was developed. The system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages. With the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 V, the CAP removal efficiencies increased from 53.3% to 89.7%, while the methane production increased more than three times. The microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria, both of which enhanced CAP removal and methane production. The improved CAP removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination-related bacteria (Acidovorax, Sedimentibacter, Thauera, and Flavobacterium) and potential electroactive bacteria (Shewanella and Comamonas), both of which carried ARGs and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of CAP. The enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative-related bacteria (Paludibacter, Proteiniclasticum, and Macellibacteroides) in the anaerobic bioreactor. The increased abundances of methanogenic genes (mcrA and ACAS genes) under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system. The fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewaters are considered as a significant source of pathogenic microorganisms and wide spectrum of various compounds. In this study the capsulation of ferrate using 3D printing and its application for the degradation of selected pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and its metabolites in real wastewater from the effluent of urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Petrzalka and Psychiatric clinic was investigated.
   In the first part of the study, the stability of capsules made from various polymeric materials was tested. The best results were found in the case of the laboratory 3D-printed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) capsules where high long-term stability of ferrate was observed. In this type of capsules ferrate can be stored at ambient conditions more than one month without significant decrease of its degradation efficiency.
   In the next part of the study the ability of ferrate capsulated in 3D printed PVA capsules to oxidize various micropollutants present in real wastewater was tested. The best efficiency was achieved for clarithromycin, azithromycin, valsartan, diclofenac, atenolol and carbamazepine (over 80%). However, some of the tested compounds, such as caffeine, tramadol, and venlafaxine were only partially oxidized. It was also found that an increase of the amount of capsulated ferrate did not always lead to a significant increase of degradation efficiency. Capsulation of ferrate used in our research gives, therefore, the possibility not only to store but also to instantly apply ferrate in emergency situations and even in those environments where pure ferrate is rapidly decomposed.

AB The indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics and their introduction into the environment have caused global concerns. Typically, following consumption, these compounds are introduced into the environment after incomplete metabolism, and a large portion of them are impossible to remove using conventional wastewater treatment systems. The main aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a TiO2/UV-C nanophotocatalyst doped with trivalent iron for the removal of amoxicillin from aquatic solutions. The nanophotocatalyst was prepared and characterized by SEM, XRD, EDX, DRS, and photoluminescence spectrum. The influences of different parameters, including nanocatalyst concentration (30-90 mg/L), initial concentration of amoxicillin (10-45 mg/L), and pH (3-11) at different time intervals (30-120 min) on antibiotic removal efficiency were investigated. Antibiotic concentration was measured with an HPLC device. All experiments were replicated three times according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20(th) edition. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 and the ANOVA statistical test. Optimal conditions for removing amoxicillin from a synthetic solution were as follows: pH 11, initial concentration of antibiotic = 10 mg/L, nanocatalyst = 90 mg/L, and contact time = 120 min. The optimal conditions were also used to remove amoxicillin from Dana Pharmaceutical Company wastewater. The removal efficiencies of antibiotic for synthetic and pharmaceutical wastewater were 99.14 and 88.92%, respectively. According to the results, the nanophotocatalyst TiO2/UV-C may be used for the removal of significant amounts of amoxicillin from pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB The overarching aim of this field study was to examine causal links between in-situ exposure to complex mixtures of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants and effects on freshwater microbial communities in the receiving streams. To reach this goal, we assessed the toxicity of serial dilutions of micropollutant mixtures, extracted from deployed passive samplers at the discharge sites of four Swiss wastewater treatment plants, to in situ periphyton from upstream and downstream of the effluents. On the one hand, comparison of the sensitivities of upstream and downstream periphyton to the micro pollutant mixtures indicated that algal and bacterial communities composing the periphyton displayed higher tolerance towards these micropollutants downstream than upstream. On the other hand, molecular analyses of the algal and bacterial structure showed a clear separation between upstream and downstream periphyton across the sites. This finding provides an additional line of evidence that micropollutants from the wastewater discharges were directly responsible for the change in the community structure at the sampling sites by eliminating the micropollutant-sensitive species and favouring the tolerant ones. What is more, the fold increase of algal and bacterial tolerance from upstream to downstream locations was variable among sampling sites and was strongly correlated to the intensity of contamination by micropollutants at the respective sites. Overall, our study highlights the sensitivity of the proposed approach to disentangle effects of micropollutant mixtures from other environmental factors occurring in the field and, thus, establishing a causal link between exposure and the observed ecological effects on freshwater microbial communities.

AB The feasibility of treating of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing rich organic sulfur compounds and sulfate using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) was investigated. The initial COD/SO42- ratio of 8 in the wastewater varied from 5 to 1.5 after adding sulfate. Of interest that under the condition of COD/SO42- at 8 and 5, despite the simultaneous generation of sulfide and hydrogen sulfide, the sulfate concentration in the effluent was higher than in the influent. This is due to the sulfur release in the form of sulfate during the degradation of these organic sulfur compounds in this reactor. Conversely, at COD/SO42- of 1.5, influent sulfate was higher than effluent sulfate due to reduction of more sulfates in the reactor. At COD/SO42- of 8, for practical application, the optimum OLR was found to be 8 kg COD/m(3)/d, where a nearly 70% COD reduction occurred with biogas containing 63% methane. In this stage, the distribution of the archaea and bacterial community varied greatly with altered OLR (accompanied with prolonged operation time). Some species, such as Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Clostridium cellulovorans were expected to be partly responsible for S release from some organic sulfur compounds in the reactor. By increasing the sulfate loading at a COD/SO42- ratio up to 1.5 resulted in a light inhibition of methanogenesis due to the high sulfide concentration (1212 SO42- - S mg/L) with no obvious suppression of sulfidogenesis.

AB This study assessed volatile organic compound (VOC) emission characteristics from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in five Taiwanese industrial districts engaged in numerous manufacturing processes, including petrochemical, science-based industry (primarily semiconductors, photo-electronics, electronic products and biological technology), as well as multiple manufacturing Processes (primarily pharmaceuticals and paint manufacturing). The most aqueous hydrocarbons dissolved in the wastewater of Taiwanese WWTPs were acetoric, acrylonitrile, methylene chloride, and chloroform for the petrochemical districts: acetone, chloroform. and toluene for the science-based districts;, and chlorinated and aromatic hydrocarbons for the multiple industrial districts. The aqueous pollutants in the United WWTPs were closely related to the characteristics of the manufacturing plants ill the districts. To effectively prevent VOC emissions from the primary treatment section of petrochemical WWTPs, the Updated regulations governing VOC emissions were issued by the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration in September 2005, legally mandating a seal cover system incorporating venting and air purification equipment. Cost analysis indicates that incinerators with regenerative heat recovery are optimal for treating high VOC concentrations, exceeding 10,000 ppm as CH4, from the on separation basins. However, the emission concentrations, ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm as CH4 from the Other Primary treatment facilities and bio-treatment stages, should be collected and then injected into the biological oxidation basins via existing or new blowers. The additional capital and operating costs required to treat the VOC emissions of 1000 ppm as CH4 from primary treatment facilities are less than US$0.1 for per m(3) wastewater treatment capacity.

AB In the present study, oxidative pre-treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater originating from the formulation of the penicillin Sultamycillin Tosylate Diydrate via ozonation at varying pH and ozone feed rates was investigated. Biological treatability studies were performed with a synthetic wastewater alone and supplemented with raw and ozonated penicillin formulation effluents. The highest COD (34%) and TOC (24%) removal efficiencies were obtained at pH 11.0, whereas the BOD5 value increased from 16 mg l(-1) to 128 mg l(-1) after 40 min of ozonation, corresponding to an applied ozone dose of 1670 mg l(-1) and 33% relative ozone absorption. The studies showed that no degradation of raw penicillin fraction (30% of total COD) occurred, and degradation of the synthetic wastewater being completely treatable without penicillin addition, was inhibited by 7%. Upon 40 min ozonation, the synthetic wastewater could be completely oxidized and at the same time 35% of ozonated penicillin wastewater removal was obtained. Respirometric studies were conducted in parallel and produced results indicating a 22% decrease in the total oxygen consumption rate established for raw penicillin formulation effluent compared to the results obtained from the aerobic batch reactor. No inhibition of the synthetic fraction was observed for the 40 min-ozonated penicillin formulation effluent, biodegradability of the 60 min-ozonated penicillin effluent decreased possibly due to recalcitrant oxidation product accumulation. The modeling study provided experimental support and information on inhibition kinetics in activated sludge model no. 3 (ASM3) by means of respirometric tests for the first time.

AB Photoreaction with the Fe(III)-oxalate complex has been reported to play an important role in various photochemical reactions in the natural atmospheric environment, and are applicable to treat various recalcitrant compounds in wastewater. We previously showed that a Fe(II) oxalate (FeOx) crystal can be recovered from the wastewater generated from soil washing, which can then be applied to the photoreaction for degradation of recalcitrant pollutants; however, photoreactions with FeOx compounds have not been fully reported yet. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the photoreaction characteristics of FeOx recovered from wastewater, to demonstrate the feasibility of its application to wastewater treatment. The physical and chemical properties of FeOx were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The photoreaction of FeOx showed high methylene blue (MB) removal efficiencies similar to the reaction with TiO2, indicating that FeOx is applicable to the photoreaction for degradation of pollutants. Furthermore, the photodegradation of MB with FeOx was observed under visible light, as opposed to TiO2. MB could be removed by the photoreaction of FeOx under both basic and acidic pH conditions. Under basic pH conditions, MB could be removed by FeOx via both photoreaction and surface adsorption. The concentration of FeOx affected light penetration and Fe and oxalate levels in the solution, resulting in different MB removal kinetics. The photoreaction efficiency of FeOx could be affected by both photoreaction of Fe and oxalate in the solution and photoreaction and adsorption reaction of the FeOx surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat a variety of diseases. Consequently, these compounds have been found in water and wastewater matrix. Despite studies have proven its toxicity, just a few works investigate techniques to degrade and mineralize them. To solve this issue, this work presents the degradation and mineralization of prednisone (PRED) by electrochemical advanced oxidation (EAO) using a boron-doped diamond supported on niobium (Nb/BDD) anode in synthetic and real wastewater. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the PRED oxidation mechanisms. CV suggest that PRED will be oxidized via HO center dot and other oxidants generated from the ions present in the liquid matrix (S2O82-, SO4 center dot-, HCIO, ClO- etc.). Different EAO conditions as initial pH (3, 7 and 11) and applied current densities (5, 10 and 20 mA cm(-2)) were evaluated. The best result was obtained at alkaline pH (11) and a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), achieving 78% of degradation and 42% of mineralization. Using the best conditions, the EAO was applied as a polishing treatment stage to remove PRED from a biological pretreated municipal wastewater spiked with PRED. The results indicate that EAO applied in the real matrix provides better results than the synthetic solution, probably associated with the presence of ions that can be electrochemically converted into oxidant species, resulting in higher kinetic constant, mineralization current efficiency and lower energetic consumption. Therefore, the EAO process without the addition of chemicals has proven to be an effective alternative as a tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater contaminated with PRED. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The complete removal of biorecalcitrant xenobiotics, including most notably the pharmaceutical pollutants, by advanced oxidation processes is often difficult to be reached in urban or industrial wastewater because of the high concentration of organic and inorganic scavengers that compete with the xenobiotics for the oxidizing species. This work investigates a coupled treatment train in which wastewater effluents are pretreated with a negatively charged loose nanofiltration (NF) membrane (HydraCoRe70, made up of sulfonated polyethersulfone) to enhance the removal of xenobiotics with the thermal Fenton process. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug prescribed mainly for epilepsy treatment, is used here as a model xenobiotic. After optimizing the conditions for separation and degradation, the NF-Fenton approach was applied to both synthetic wastewater and real samples to assess the overall efficiency of CBZ removal. The Fenton degradation of CBZ was drastically enhanced in nanofiltered samples, thanks to the removal by the membrane of nearly all organic matter that would otherwise consume the reactive oxidizing species (e.g., the hydroxyl radical). On the basis of a preliminary treatment cost analysis, it can be concluded that the combined process is potentially applicable to the treatment of several kinds of wastewaters (e.g., industrial ones) to favor the removal of biorecalcitrant contaminants. Key cost savings of NF-Fenton concern the lower amounts of Fenton reagents needed to degrade CBZ and (even more importantly) the decreased levels of acids and bases for pH adjustment before and after the oxidative process because of the lower buffer capacity of the NF permeate compared to feed wastewater, after the removal by the NF of many inorganic ions and most organic carbon.

AB Complex mixtures of micropollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals emitted by wastewater effluents to European rivers may compromise the quality of these water resources and may pose a risk to ecosystem health and abstraction of drinking water. In the present study, an integrated analytical and bioanalytical approach was applied to investigate the impact of untreated wastewater effluents from the city of Novi Sad, Serbia, into the River Danube. The study was based on three on-site large volume solid phase extracted water samples collected upstream and downstream of the untreated wastewater discharge. Chemical screening with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was applied together with a battery of in vitro cell-based bioassays covering important steps of the cellular toxicity pathway to evaluate effects on the activation of metabolism (arylhydrocarbon receptor AhR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma PPAR gamma), specific modes of action (estrogen receptor ER alpha, androgen receptor AR) and adaptive stress responses (oxidative stress, inflammation). Increased effects, significantly changed contamination patterns and higher chemical concentrations were observed downstream of the wastewater discharge. A mass balance approach showed that enhanced endocrine disruption was in good agreement with concentrations of detected hormones, while only a smaller fraction of the effects on xenobiotic metabolism (<1%) and adaptive stress responses (0-12%) could be explained by the detected chemicals. The chemical and effects patterns observed upstream of the discharge point were fairly re-established at about 7 km downstream, demonstrating the enormous dilution capacity of this large river.

AB Ozonation, is effective in improving the quality of, municipal wastewater effluents by eliminating organic micropollutants. Nevertheless, ozone process design is still limited by (i) the large number of structurally diverse micropollutants and (ii) the varying quality Of wastewater matrices (especially dissolved, organic matter). These issues were addressed by grouping 16 micropollutants according to their, ozone and hydroxyl radical, ((OH)-O-center dot) rate constants and normalizing the applied ozone dose to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (i.e., g O-3/g DOC). Consistent elimination of micropollutants., was observed in 10 secondary municipal wastewater effluents spiked with 16 micropollutants (similar to 2 mu g/L) in the absence of ozone demand exerted by nitrite. The elimination of ozone-refractory micropollutants was well predicted by measuring the (OH)-O-center dot exposure by the decrease of the probe compound p-chlorobenzoic acid. The average molar (OH)-O-center dot yields (moles of (OH)-O-center dot produced per mole of ozone consumed) were 21 +/- 3% for g O-3/g DOC = 1.0, and the average rate constant for the reaction of (OH)-O-center dot with effluent organic matter was (2.1 +/- 0.6) x 10(4) (mg C/L)(-1) s(-1). On the basis of these results, a DOC-normalized ozone dose, together with the rate constants for the reaction of the selected micropollutants with ozone and (OH)-O-center dot, and the measurement of the (OH)-O-center dot exposure are proposed as key parameters for the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutants during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents with varying water quality.

AB Triclosan, a common antimicrobial agent, may react during the disinfection of wastewater with free chlorine to form three chlorinated triclosan derivatives (CTDs). This is of concern because the CTDs may be photochemically transformed to tri- and tetra-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins when discharged into natural waters. In this study, wastewater influent, secondary (pre-disinfection) effluent, and final (post-disinfection) effluent samples were collected on two occasions each from two activated sludge wastewater treatment plants, one using chlorine disinfection and one using UV disinfection. Concentrations of triclosan and three CTDs were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with isotope dilution methodology. Triclosan and the CTDs were detected in every influent sample at levels ranging from 453 to 4530 and 2 to 98 ng L-1, respectively, though both were efficiently removed from the liquid phase during activated sludge treatment. Triclosan concentrations in the pre-disinfection effluent ranged from 36 to 212 ng L-1, while CTD concentrations were below the limit of quantification (1 ng L-1) for most samples. In the treatment plant that used chlorine disinfection, triclosan concentrations decreased while CTDs were formed during chlorination, as evidenced by CTD levels as high as 22 ng L-1 in the final effluent. No CTDs were detected in the final effluent of the treatment plant that used UV disinfection. The total CTD concentration in the final effluent of the chlorinating treatment plant reached nearly one third of the triclosan concentration, demonstrating that the chlorine disinfection step played a substantial role in the fate of triclosan in this system.

AB Environmental agencies must monitor an ever increasing range of contaminants of emerging concern, including endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). An alternative to using ultra-trace chemical analysis of samples for EDCs is to test for biological activity using in vitro screening assays, then use these assay results to direct analytical chemistry approaches. In this study, we used both analytical approaches and in vitro bioassays to characterize the EDCs present in treated wastewater from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Ontario, Canada. Estrogen-mediated activity was assessed using a yeast estrogenicity screening (YES) assay. An in vitro competitive binding assay was used to assess capacity to interfere with binding of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T4) to the recombinant human thyroid hormone transport protein, transthyretin (i.e. hTTR). An in vitro binding assay with a rat peroxisome proliferator responsive element transfected into a rainbow trout gill cell line was used to evaluate binding and subsequent gene expression via the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR). Analyses of a suite of contaminants known to be EDCs in extracts from treated wastewater were conducted using either gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Estrogenic activity was detected in the YES assay only in those extracts that contained detectable amounts of estradiol (E2). There was a positive relationship between the degree of response in the T4-hTTR assay and the amounts of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners 47 and 99, triclosan and the PBDE metabolite, 4-OH-BDE17. Several wastewater extracts gave a positive response in the PPAR assay, but these responses were not correlated with the amounts of any of the EDCs analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Overall, these data indicate that a step-wise approach is feasible using a combination of in vitro testing and instrumental analysis to monitor for EDCs in wastewater and other environmental matrixes.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are two important groups of emerging pollutants due to their toxicological and chemical characteristics and their persistent detection in the aquatic environment. Wastewater treatment plants are a significant pathway for their transfer to the water courses. It is well evidenced that these chemicals are only partially removed through biological treatment of wastewater and therefore being detected in secondary effluents. This work focuses on the evaluation of the efficiency of two well-established disinfection technologies (chlorination and UV irradiation) along with UV/H O-2 (2) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) to remove these chemicals from biologically treated wastewater. Based on the results it is shown that appreciable removal efficiencies due to chlorination should be expected for most of the target compounds, whereas this was not the case for ibuprofen and ketoprofen. With the exemption of diclofenac and ketoprofen direct UV irradiation did not efficiently removed target compounds for UV doses usually applied for disinfection purposes. The application of advanced UV treatment through the addition of H O-2 (2) although resulted in increased removal of the target compounds is not sufficient at moderate UV and H O-2 (2) doses to achieve satisfactory removal efficiencies. PAC use resulted in sufficient removal of target compounds although high PAC doses were required for some chemicals. Comparison of Freundlich isotherms of this study with those of other studies, derived employing water samples, suggested that the water matrix along with the target compounds concentration range can significantly affect the outcome of the experiments.

AB The occurrence of micropollutants (MPs) in the aquatic environment poses a threat to the environment and to the human health. The application of sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) to eliminate these contaminants has attracted attention in recent years. In this work, the simultaneous degradation of 20 multi-class MPs (classified into 5 main categories, namely antibiotics, beta-blockers, other pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and herbicides) was evaluated for the first time in secondary treated wastewater, by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with UV-A radiation, without any pH adjustment or iron addition. The optimal PMS concentration to remove the spiked target MPs (100 mu g L-1) from wastewater was 0.1 mM, leading to an average degradation of 80% after 60 min, with most of the elimination occurring during the first 5 min. Synergies between radiation and the oxidant were demonstrated and quantified, with an average extent of synergy of 69.1%. The optimized treatment was then tested using non-spiked wastewater, in which 12 out of the 20 target contaminants were detected. Among these, 7 were degraded at some extent, varying from 10.7% (acetamiprid) to 94.4% (ofloxacin), the lower removals being attributed to the quite inferior ratio of MPs to natural organic matter. Phytotoxicity tests carried out with the wastewater before and after photo-activated PMS oxidation revealed a decrease in the toxicity and that the plants were able to grow in the presence of the treated water. Therefore, despite the low degradation rates obtained for some MPs, the treatment effectively reduces the toxicity of the matrix, making the water safer for reuse.

AB Micropollutants such as pharmaceutical active compounds, present at high concentration in hospital wastewater (HWW), pose both environmental and human health challenges. Fungal reactors can effectively remove such contaminants and produce non-toxic effluents, but their ability to operate for a long period of time is yet to be demonstrated in real hospital wastewater. Several process variables need to be studied beforehand. Here, variables: pellet size, aeration and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio are studied in continuous operations with real HWW. Moreover, a novel strategy for inoculum production that could reduce economical and operational costs is proposed and tested. Optimum pellet size was found to be 2 mm and an aeration of 0.8 L min(-1) was needed to maintain fungal viability. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 7.5 was selected and the pellet production time was reduced from 6 to 3 days.

AB The occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment, and in aquatic media in particular, have received considerable attention by the scientific community during the last two decades. Pharmaceuticals, which are designed to be biologically active substances, are usually lipophilic and resistant to biodegradation, thus having the potential for accumulation and persistence in the environment. Although they are usually present at relatively low concentrations, ranging between ng/L and g/L levels, they may cause serious effects on the environment. In this study, the removal efficiency of sonolysis has been tested on a mixture of 23 pharmaceuticals. Diclofenac and carbamazepine degradations were tested at different power densities (100-400W/L) using low frequency. These compounds were spiked separately in wastewater at high concentrations (mg/L). Subsequently, low-frequency ultrasound-induced degradation of a mixture of 23 emerging contaminants with low concentration (g/L) in urban wastewater was investigated, working at 100W/L. It was found that the pharmaceuticals conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities. The reaction rate for different pharmaceuticals is almost the same in the mixtures and the kinetic regimes are mainly pseudo-first order.

AB This study presents a nontarget approach to detect discharges from pharmaceutical production in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and to estimate their relevance on the total emissions. Daily composite samples were collected for 3 months at two WWTPs in Switzerland, measured using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, and time series were generated for all features detected. The extent of intensity variation in the time series was used to differentiate relatively constant domestic inputs from highly fluctuating industrial emissions. We show that an intensity variation threshold of 10 correctly classifies compounds of known origin and reveals clear differences between the two WWTPs. At the WWTP receiving wastewater from a pharmaceutical manufacturing site, (i) 10 times as many potential industrial emissions were detected as compared to the WWTP receiving purely domestic wastewater; (ii) for 11 pharmaceuticals peak concentrations, >10 mu g/L and up to 214 mu g/L were quantified, which are clearly above typical municipal wastewater concentrations; and (iii) a pharmaceutical not authorized in Switzerland was identified. Signatures of potential industrial emissions were even traceable at the downstream Rhine monitoring station at a >4000-fold dilution. Several of them occurred repeatedly, suggesting that they were linked to regular production, not to accidents. Our results demonstrate that small wastewater volumes from a single industry not only left a clear signature in the effluents of the respective WWTP but also influenced the water quality of one of Europe's most important river systems. Overall, these findings indicate that pharmaceutical production is a relevant emission source even in highly developed countries with a strong focus on water quality, such as Switzerland.

AB Several drugs of abuse, including amphetamines, cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine and several opioid prescription drugs were detected in wastewater from two Canadian cities, a small community (75,000 population) and a large urban center (1.6 million population). The objective of this study was to evaluate community use of these drugs in two cities with large differences in population size and demographics. In addition, we evaluated the use of the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) as a monitoring tool for drugs of abuse. Heroin was not detected at either location, probably because this illicit drug is metabolized to morphine prior to excretion. Acetylcodeine and acetylmorphine were also not detected. Estimates of community consumption from wastewater analysis indicated that the most widely used drug was cocaine at a median level of consumption in the larger city of approximately 38 doses per day per 1000 people. Consumption of the substituted amphetamine, ephedrine, as well as methamphetamine was also higher in the larger city, at 21 and 1.8 doses per day per 1000 people, respectively. Use of amphetamine, MDMA and tramadol were similar in both centers, but use of oxycodone was greater in the smaller city. Use of MDMA (ecstasy) peaked on weekends. Ketamine was detected in wastewater from the larger city; the first report of abuse of this veterinary anesthetic in a North American city. POCIS sampling rates were determined for the first time for 7 of the target compounds. Comparing the time weighted average concentrations estimated from POCIS data to the concentrations obtained from 24-h composite samples, the data were generally comparable, except for some compounds which were not detected in POCIS deployed in the untreated wastewater, probably because of biofouling or accumulation of debris on the cages containing the POCIS. This study indicates that the size and demographics of population centers can influence the patterns of abuse of drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The pharmaceutical industry of Pakistan is growing with an annual growth rate of 10%. Besides this growth, this industry is not complying with environmental standards, and discharging its effluent into domestic wastewater network. Only limited information is available about the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) in the environmental matrices of Pakistan that has motivated us to aim at the occurrence and ecological risk assessment of 11 PCs of different therapeutic classes in the wastewater of pharmaceutical industry and in its receiving environmental matrices such as sludge, solid waste and soil samples near the pharmaceutical formulation units along Shiekhupura road, Lahore, Pakistan. Target PCs (paracetamol, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, amlodipine, rosuvastatin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and gemifloxacin) were quantified using in-house developed HPLC-UV. Ibuprofen (1673 mu g/L, 6046 mu/kg, 1229 mu g/kg and 610 mu g/kg), diclofenac (836 mu g/L, 4968 mu g/kg, 6632 mu g/kg and 257 mu g/kg) and naproxen (464 mu g/L, 7273 mu g/kg, 4819 mu g/kg and 199 mu g/kg) showed the highest concentrations among 11 target PCs in wastewater, sludge, solid waste and soil samples, respectively. Ecological risk assessment, in terms of risk quotient (RQ), was also carried out based on the maximum measured concentration of PCs in wastewater. The maximum RQ values obtained were with paracetamol (64 against daphnia), naproxen (177 against fish), diclofenac (12,600 against Oncorhynchus mykiss), ibuprofen (167,300 against Oryzias latipes), ofloxacin (81,000 against Pseudomonas putida) and ciprofloxacin (440 against Microcystis aeruginosa). These results show a high level of ecological risk due to the discharge of untreated wastewater from pharmaceutical units. This risk may further lead to food web contamination and drug resistance in pathogens. Thus, further studies are needed to detect the PCs in crops as well as the government should strictly enforce environmental legislation on these pharmaceutical units.

AB Submerged membrane bioreactors (SMBR) are widely known for their advantages in the field of wastewater treatment. However, despite the significant technological advances in recent decades, membrane fouling remains one of the major concerns for its efficient application. Recent studies, carried out with synthetic wastewater, show that the integration of electrochemical processes as electrocoagulation with membranes technologies provides promising advantages. This research focuses on the performance of a pilot-scale membrane electrobioreactor (SMEBR) treating real wastewater with an average organic loading rate of 0.91 +/- 0.44 mg/L COD from a municipal wastewater treatment plant). Current densities of 5, 10, and 15 A/m(2) (charge loading of 214.17, 428.34 and 642.42 mA m(3).h respectively) and exposure time of 5 ' ON/10 ' OFF were applied to compare the efficiency of the SMEBR system versus the SMBR. The removal efficiencies of COD, nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and 10 selected micropollutants (8 pharmaceuticals and 2 pesticides) were studied. The results showed that the SMEBR system improved the treated effluent quality in comparison with the SMBR, mainly regarding phosphorus, increasing its elimination by an average of 34.6%, and the micropollutants acetaminophen, clarithromycin and carbamazepine, which presented an average increase in the removal rates of 19%, 43% and 28%, respectively, comparing with those obtained in the SMBR. The optimal operational conditions were obtained when a current density of 5/A/m(2) was applied. At this stage, the SMEBR showed a significant reduction in the membrane fouling, achieving reductions rates in transmembrane pressure and extracellular polymeric substances of 72.8% and 55.5%, respectively.

AB The presence of the anesthetic lidocaine (LDC), the analgesic tramadol (TRA), the antidepressant venlafaxine (VEN) and the metabolites O-desmethyltramadol (ODT) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) was investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, in surface waters and in groundwater. The analytes were detected in all effluent samples and in only 64% of the surface water samples. The mean concentrations of the analytes in effluent samples from WWTPs with wastewater from only households and hospitals were 107 (LDC), 757 (TRA), 122 (ODT), 160 (VEN) and 637 ng L-1 (ODV), while the mean concentrations in effluents from WWTPs treating additionally wastewater from pharmaceutical industries as indirect dischargers were for some pharmaceuticals clearly higher. WWTP effluents were identified as important sources of the analyzed pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in surface waters. The concentrations of the compounds found in surface waters ranged from <LOQ to 176 (LDC), 381 (TRA), 261 (ODT), 122 (VEN) and 743 ng L-1 (ODV) and were dependent on the concentrations of the compounds in the WWTP effluents, the proportion of wastewater in the recipient water, the mean flow rate of the surface water, and the proximity of the sampling point to the WWTP discharge point. The dependence of the concentrations of the target compounds in the surface water on the distance between the sampling points and the points of WWTP discharge into the recipient rivers and streams indicates possible degradation of the compounds in the surface waters. Infiltration of the target analytes into groundwater was not observed.

AB Many organic micropollutants present in wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides, are poorly removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). To reduce the release of these substances into the aquatic environment, advanced wastewater treatments are necessary. In this context, two large-scale pilot advanced treatments were tested in parallel over more than one year at the municipal WWTP of Lausanne, Switzerland. The treatments were: i) oxidation by ozone followed by sand filtration (SF) and ii) powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption followed by either ultrafiltration (UF) or sand filtration. More than 70 potentially problematic substances (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, endocrine disruptors, drug metabolites and other common chemicals) were regularly measured at different stages of treatment. Additionally, several ecotoxicological tests such as the Yeast Estrogen Screen, a combined algae bioassay and a fish early life stage test were performed to evaluate effluent toxicity. Both treatments significantly improved the effluent quality. Micropollutants were removed on average over 80% compared with raw wastewater, with an average ozone dose of 5.7 mg O-3 I-1 or a PAC dose between 10 and 20 mg I-1. Depending on the chemical properties of the substances (presence of electron-rich moieties, charge and hydrophobicity), either ozone or PAC performed better. Both advanced treatments led to a clear reduction in toxicity of the effluents, with PAC-UF performing slightly better overall. As both treatments had, on average, relatively similar efficiency, further criteria relevant to their implementation were considered, including local constraints (e.g., safety, sludge disposal, disinfection), operational feasibility and cost. For sensitive receiving waters (drinking water resources or recreational waters), the PAC-UF treatment, despite its current higher cost, was considered to be the most suitable option, enabling good removal of most micropollutants and macropollutants without forming problematic by-products, the strongest decrease in toxicity and a total disinfection of the effluent.

AB We measured concentrations of 56 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in effluent samples from 50 large wastewater treatment plants across the US. Hydrochlorothiazide was found in every sample. Metoprolol, atenolol, and carbamazepine were found in over 90% of the samples. Valsartan had the highest concentration (5300 ng/L), and also had the highest average concentration (1600 ng/L) across all 50 samples. Estimates of potential risks to healthy human adults were greatest for six anti-hypertensive APIs (lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan, atenolol, enalaprilat, and metoprolol), but nevertheless suggest risks of exposure to individual APIs as well as their mixtures are generally very low. Estimates of potential risks to aquatic life were also low for most APIs, but suggest more detailed study of potential ecological impacts from four analytes (sertraline, propranolol, desmethylsertraline, and valsartan).

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent widely used in many household and personal care products. Widespread use of this compound has led to the elevated concentrations of triclosan in wastewater, wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters. In this study removal of triclosan by aqueous ozone was investigated and the degradation products formed during ozonation of an aqueous solution of triclosan were analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS. The following transformation products have been identified: 2,4-dichlorophenol, chlorocatecol, mono-hydroxy-triclosan and di-hydroxy-triclosan during treatment process. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of pure triclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol have been investigated and the results showed reduced genotoxic effects after ozonation, though the respective chlorophenol is harmful to aquatic organisms.

AB A mass balance model was developed to estimate prescription pharmaceutical loadings to municipal wastewater treatment plants via computation of influent concentrations (C (IN)). Model estimates of C (IN) were compared with published data and found to be accurate within an order of magnitude for some 90% of the drugs evaluated. The model was then used to rank prescription drugs on a per-capita mass loading basis for comparison with current research efforts and coupled with two EPISuite ((TM)) programs to generate estimates for environmental exposure. Results showed marked discrepancies between prescription numbers, loadings, exposures, and research conducted, as highlighted by the drug metformin, with the largest projected loading to treatment plants (> 28 g per 1,000 people/day), yet only ranking 12th in terms of prescription numbers and no environmental research articles.

AB Sequential treatments consisting in a chemical process followed by a conventional biological treatment, have been applied to remove mixtures of nine contaminants of pharmaceutical type spiked in a primary sedimentation effluent of a municipal wastewater. Combinations of ozone, UVA black light (BL) and Fe(III) or Fe3O4 catalysts constituted the chemical systems. Regardless of the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP), the removal of pharmaceutical compounds was achieved in 1h of reaction, while total organic carbon (TOC) only diminished between 3.4 and 6%. Among selected ozonation systems to be implemented before the biological treatment, the application of ozone alone in the pre-treatment stage is recommended due to the increase of the biodegradability observed. The application of ozone followed by the conventional biological treatment leads high TOC and COD removal rates, 60 and 61%, respectively, and allows the subsequent biological treatment works with shorter hydraulic residence time (HRT). Moreover, the influence of the application of AOPs before and after a conventional biological process was compared, concluding that the decision to take depends on the characterization of the initial wastewater with pharmaceutical compounds.

AB The occurrence of bioactive trace pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in natural waters is an emerging issue. Numerous pharmaceuticals are not completely removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Advanced oxidation processes may represent an interesting alternative to completely mineralize organic trace pollutants. In this article, we show that sulfate radicals generated from peroxymonosulfate/Co(II) are more efficient than hydroxyl radicals generated from the Fenton's reagent (H(2)O(2)/Fe(II)) for the degradation of the pharmaceutical compound, carbamazepine. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of SO(4) (center dot-) with carbamazepine is 1.92 center dot 10(9) M(-1) s(-1). In laboratory grade water and in real urban wastewater, SO(4) (center dot-) yielded a faster degradation of carbamazepine compared to HO(center dot) . Under strongly oxidizing conditions, a nearly complete mineralization of carbamazepine was achieved, while under mildly oxidizing conditions, several intermediates were identified by LC-MS. These results show for the first time in real urban wastewater that sulfate radicals are more selective than hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of an organic pollutant and may represent an interesting alternative in advanced oxidation processes.

A fully automated method consisting of on-line solid phase extraction coupled to LC-ESI-MS/MS was developed and validated for the simultaneous trace determination of different biocidal compounds (1,2-benzisothiazoline-3-one (BIT), 3-lodo-2-propynylbutyl-carbamate (IPBC), irgarol 1051 and 2-N-octyl-4-isothiazolinone (octhilinone, OIT), carbendazim, diazinon, diuron, isoproturon, mecoprop, terbutryn and terbutylazine) and pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole) in wastewater and surface water. In the tertiary effluent, the highest average concentrations were determined for mecoprop (1010 ng/L) which was at comparable levels as the pharmaceuticals diclofenac (690 ng/L) and sulfamethoxazole (140 ng/L) but 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the other biocidal compounds. Average eliminations for all compounds were usually below 50%. During rain events, increased residual amounts of biocidal contaminants are discharged to receiving surface waters.

AB The treatment of municipal wastewater in the Arctic is challenging due to a variety of financial, operational, climatic and technical issues. To better understand the efficacy of current wastewater treatment in this region and the hazard posed to receiving waters, we assessed the occurrence of nutrients and contaminants (i.e., pharmaceuticals, antibiotic resistance genes) as they moved through a lagoon-based treatment system in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Wastewater treatment in this community is performed by the use of a lagoon -tundra wetland system that is discharged into the marine environment and is representative of current common practices throughout the region. In 2014, samples were collected before and during lagoon discharge from two locations in the main lagoon, one location downstream from the lagoon effluent and three locations offshore. Grab samples were collected to measure nutrients (e.g., total nitrogen and phosphorus) and the presence of antibiotic resistance gene bearing microbes, and Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were deployed to collect passively organic contaminants in all locations. A total of six pharmaceuticals were detected from a screen of twenty-eight analytes during the study: atenolol, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The greatest concentrations of nutrients, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and pharmaceuticals were found in sampling locations within the treatment lagoon. Offshore of the release point, we observed limited to no detection of pharmaceuticals and ARGs, but no change in total nitrogen and phosphorus from pre-release.

AB In this study, a novel PA-g/co-PVP reverse osmosis (RO) composite membrane with high-hydrophilic, antifouling, high salt rejection properties, was prepared according to the principle of sand-fixing grass effect for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) was used as a "seed agent" that was seeped into a low cross-linked polyamide (PA) film. A hydrophilic molecular brush of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) grafted on the PA surface (PA-g-PVP) similar to grass growing on sand and a cross-linked copolymer layer of PA and NVP (PA-co-NVP) similar to grass roots distributed in sand, as well as an interlayer cross-linking between PA separation layer and PES ultrafiltration membrane with a highly stable interfacial structure, synchronously occurred through gamma-ray radiation. Upon incorporation of 1.0% of NVP, the resultant PA-g/co-PVP membrane achieved 18.8 degrees water contact angle and high flux recovery ratio (FRR) values of 91.23%, 96.28%, and 93.67% for the foulants of bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium alginate (SA), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively. The FRR value of pharmaceutical wastewater-polluted membrane after cleaning was 94.30%. The PAg/co-PVP RO membrane showed outstanding separation stability due to the radiation cross-linking reactions, which limit matrix swelling and interface delamination similar to the action principle of sand-fixing grass. These merits prove that the RO membrane developed in this study can be used in many applications, including small organic molecular wastewater separation.

AB This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R-2 = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.

AB Previous research has focused on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a surrogate for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in pharmaceutical wastewater. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as a part of DOM has received little attention. This study investigated the removal characteristics of DON and its influence on the N-nitrosodimethylamine formation potential (NDMA FP) and acute toxicity of DOM in a full-scale hydrolysis/acidification + anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic + moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Results showed that maximum removal of DON (68 +/- 12%) was present in the anaerobic process. The removal of DON by anoxic and aerobic processes was negligible as a result of the production of new N-containing compounds that are characteristic of proteins/amino sugars and lipids. DON concentration decreased significantly in the MBBR process (p < 0.05, t-test), indicating that manipulation of the solids retention times (SRTs) could be a solution to minimize DON. Based on the Pearson correlation analysis, the behavior of NDMA FP and DOM acute toxicity was significantly associated with the 3 kDa < MW < 10 kDa (r = 0.709, p < 0.05) and MW < 3 kDa DON (r = 0.659, p < 0.05), respectively, and are not identical to that of DOC fractions (r = 0.037-0.466, p = 0.051-0.886). Moreover, the removal and molecular changes of DON are not coupled with that of DOC during biotreatment. Thus, testing the performance indicator of DON in pharmaceutical wastewater was recommended, as it provides important information for DOM removal characteristics. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hospital wastewater represents a significant input of pharmaceuticals into municipal wastewater. As Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBRs) appear to remove organic micro-pollutants, hospital wastewater was treated with a pilot plant consisting of three MBBRs in series. The removal of pharmaceuticals was studied in two experiments: 1) A batch experiment where pharmaceuticals were spiked to each reactor and 2) a continuous flow experiment at native concentrations. DOC removal, nitrification as well as removal of pharmaceuticals (including X-ray contrast media, beta-blockers, analgesics and antibiotics) occurred mainly in the first reactor. In the batch experiment most of the compounds followed a single first-order kinetics degradation function, giving degradation rate constants ranged from 5.77 x 10(-3) to 4.07 h(-1), from -5.53 x 10(-3) to 9.24 x 10(-1) h(-1) and from 1.83 x 10(-3) to 2.42 x 10(-1) h(-1) for first, second and third reactor respectively. Generally, the highest removal rate constants were found in the first reactor while the lowest were found in the third one. This order was inverted for most compounds, when the removal rate constants were normalized to biomass, indicating that the last tank had the most effective biofilms. In the batch experiment, 21 out of 26 compounds were assessed to be degraded with more than 20% within the MBBR train. In the continuous flow experiment the measured removal rates were lower than those estimated from the batch experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A full-scale novel combined anaerobic/micro-aerobic and two-stage aerobic biological process is used for the treatment of an actual chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing amoxicillin. The anaerobic system is an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), the micro-aerobic system is a novel micro-aerobic hydrolysis acidification reactor (NHAR) and the two-stage aerobic process comprised cyclic activated sludge system (CASS) and biological contact oxidation tank (BCOT). The influent wastewater was high in COD, NH3-N varying daily 4016-13,093 mg-COD L-1 and 156.4-650.2 mg-NH3-N L-1, amoxicillin varying weekly between 69.1 and 105.4 mg-amoxicillin L-1, respectively; Almost all the COD, NH3-N, amoxicillin were removed by the biological combined system, with removal percentages 97%, 93.4% and 97.2%, respectively, leaving around 104 mg-COD L-1, 9.4 mg-NH3-N L-1 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 mg-amoxicillin L-1 in the final clarifier effluent. The performance evaluation of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) by mathematical statistic methods shown that at most of time effluent can meet the higher treatment discharge standard. In addition, the fate of amoxicillin in the full-scale WWTP and the amoxicillin removal rate of each different removal routes in UASB, NHAR, CASS, BCOT and final clarifier processes are investigated in this paper. The results show that biodegradation, adsorption and hydrolysis are the major mechanisms for amoxicillin removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Various techniques are available for wastewater treatment. However, some types of pollutants in wastewater need advance treatment such as pharmaceutical components. Advanced oxidation process is one of the most helpful methods to degrade the emerging contaminant like Ibuprofen (IBP). We designed a batch reactor, including light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, TiO2 and modified TiO2, to treat synthetic wastewater containing IBP. Our experimental design consisted of 0.5, 2 and 5 mg of IBP, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 g of TiO2 and modified TiO2, respectively, pH 5, 7 and 9 and exposure time 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h. We achieved the optimum amount of FeENCS-TiO2 and TiO2 of 0.2 and 0.3 g, respectively, for IBP removal from synthetic wastewater. At pH 7, IBP concentration of 0.5 mg/l and 3 h radiation time, we obtained 91.4% and 52.4% degradation efficiency of IBP from synthetic wastewater in FeFNS-TiO2/LED and TiO2/LED processes, respectively. The study of synergistic effects also indicated the positive effect of photocatalyst and LED on each other. The removal efficiency in the FeFNS-TiO2/LED and TiO2/LED processes declined by 37.3% and 23.8%, respectively, while adding some amounts of tert-butyl as radical scavenger in the IBP solution. This experiment may indicate the photocatalytic degradation of IBP with the mechanism of hydroxyl radical. We fitted Lagergren's first-order model in a condition, including pH values 7 and 5, 0.5 mg/l IBP concentrations in the synthetic wastewater, 0.2 g of m-TiO2, 0.3 g of TiO2 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h time of exposure. The kinetic rate constant for TiO2/LED and modified TiO2/LED were 0.0591 and -0.123, respectively.

AB A simple, accurate, precise, rapid, economical and sensitive ultraviolet method has been developed for the estimation of guaiphenesin in pharmaceutical preparations and environmental wastewater samples, which shows maximum absorbance at 275 nm in 20:80 ethanol-water. Beer's law was obeyed in the range of 0.5-6 mu g/ml, with molar absorptivity of 2.457 x10(4) L.mol(-1).cm(-1), relative standard deviation of the method was less than 1.7%, and accuracy (average recovery %) was 100 +/- 1.0. No interference was observed from common excipients and additives often accompany with guaiphenesin in pharmaceutical preparations .The method was successfully applied to the determination of guaiphenesin in some pharmaceutical formulations (syrups) and industrial wastewater samples. The proposed method was validated by sensitivity and precision which proves suitability for the routine analysis of guaiphenesin in true samples.

ID PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION; OXIDATION; REMOVAL
AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis in presence of nanoparticles has become a promising pathway for treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical components. In the present research work, degradation of aqueous solution of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHD), an antibacterial drug, has been investigated using TiO2 nanoparticles suspension in the annular photo reactor (APR) under continuous mode having the provision of catalyst recovery. During the degradation of CHD, the effects of major influencing parameters, i.e., substrate to catalyst ratio, flow rate, recycle ratio and temperature on the performance of the photo reactor and its optimization has been performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiency of the reactor has been validated by studying the degradation of other antibiotic drugs i.e. ibuprofen (IBP), atenolol (ATL) and carbamazepine (CBZ). The continuous mode operation in photo reactor has ensured the applicability of the present system in the large volume wastewater treatment. The percentage removal of drugs using such reactor having the facility of catalyst recovery is almost same as compared to typical batch photocatalytic system. Thus, the present developed system can be utilized for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical components which are photo catalytically degradable.

AB Effects of three ions, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ on biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by a functional strain Xhhh were investigated. Through orthogonal tests, Cu2+ was determined to be the most important factor influencing Xhhh biodegradation performance. Biodegradation kinetic experiments demonstrated that with Cu2+ concentration at about 2.00 mg l(-1), the maximum of specific growth rate and specific degradation rate were obtained to be 0.033 and 0.075 d(-1), respectively. The optimal levels of Mn2+ (5.00 mg l(-1)), Cu2+ (2.00 mg l(-1)) and Zn2+ (5.00 mgl(-1)) were achieved based on experimental results of their effects on the activities of manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase, and biodegradation kinetic parameters. Among three types of biodegradation kinetic models (Monod, Tessier and Contois), Tessier model was found most reasonable for kinetics description of Xhhh growth (R-2 = 0.995) and pollutants degradation (R-2 = 0.970) in the case of metals optimization. Both kinetics evaluation and experimental results demonstrated that optimization with the three metals made a great contribution to Xhhh growth and COD removal for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB This study investigated the applicability of fluorescence indexes based on the interpretation of excitation emission matrices (EEMs) by PARAFAC analysis and by selecting fluorescence intensities at a priori defined excitation/emission pairs as surrogates for monitoring the behavior of emerging organic compounds (EOCs) in two catchment basins impacted by wastewater discharges. Relevant EOC and EEM data were obtained for a 90 km stretch of the Simeto River, the main river in Sicily, and the smaller San Leonardo River, which was investigated for a 17 km stretch. The use of fluorescence indexes developed by these two different approaches resulted in similar observations. Changes of the fluorescence indexes that correspond to a group of humic-like fluorescing species were determined to be highly correlated with the concentrations of recalcitrant contaminants such as sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, which are typical wastewater markers in river water. Changes of the fluorescence indexes related to tyrosine-like substances were well correlated with the concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine, anthropogenic indicators of untreated wastewater discharges. Chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were correlated with humic-like fluorescence indexes. The observed correlations were site-specific and characterized by different regression parameters for every collection event. Caffeine and carbamazepine showed correlations with florescence indexes in the San Leonardo River and in the alluvial plain stretch of the Simeto River, whereas sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen have always been well correlated in all the investigated river stretches. However, when data of different collection events from river stretches where correlations were observed were combined, good linear correlations were obtained for data sets generated via the normalization of the measured concentrations by the average value for the corresponding collection event. These results show that fluorescence based indexes can be used to monitor the behavior of some trace organic contaminants in wastewater impacted rivers and to track wastewater discharges in streams and rivers.

AB It is essential to monitor the release of organic micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for developing environmental risk assessment and assessing compliance with legislative regulation. In this study the impact of sampling strategy on the quantitative determination of micropollutants in effluent wastewater was investigated. An extended list of 90 chiral and achiral micropollutants representing a broad range of biological and physico-chemical properties were studied simultaneously for the first time. During composite sample collection micropollutants can degrade resulting in the under-estimation of concentration. Cooling collected sub-samples to 4 degrees C stabilised >= 81 of 90 micropollutants to acceptable levels (+/- 20% of the initial concentration) in the studied effluents. However, achieving stability for all micropollutants will require an integrated approach to sample collection (i.e., multi-bottle sampling with more than one stabilisation method applied). Full-scale monitoring of effluent revealed time-paced composites attained similar information to volume-paced composites (influent wastewater requires a sampling mode responsive to flow variation). The option of monitoring effluent using time-paced composite samplers is advantageous as not all WWTPs have flow controlled samplers or suitable sites for deploying portable flow meters. There has been little research to date on the impact of monitoring, strategy on the determination of chiral micropollutants at the enantiomeric level. Variability in wastewater flow results in a dynamic hydraulic retention time within the WWTP (and upstream sewerage system). Despite chiral micropollutants being susceptible to stereo-selective degradation, no diurnal variability in their enantiomeric distribution was observed. However, unused medication can be directly disposed into the sewer network creating short-term (e.g., daily) changes to their enantiomeric distribution: As enantio-specific toxicity is observed in the environment, similar resolution of enantid-selective analysis to more routinely applied achiral methods is needed throughout the monitoring period for accurate risk assessment.

AB 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic oestrogen in oral contraceptives, is one of many pharmaceuticals found in inland waterways worldwide as a result of human consumption and excretion into wastewater treatment systems. At low parts per trillion (ppt), EE2 induces feminisation of male fish, diminishing reproductive success and causing fish population collapse. Intended water quality standards for EE2 set a much needed global precedent. Ozone and activated carbon provide effective wastewater treatments, but their energy intensities and capital/operating costs are formidable barriers to adoption. Here we describe the technical and environmental performance of a fast-developing contender for mitigation of EE2 contamination of wastewater based upon small-molecule, full-functional peroxidase enzyme replicas called "TAML activators". From neutral to basic pH, TAML activators with H2O2 efficiently degrade EE2 in pure lab water, municipal effluents and EE2-spiked synthetic urine. TAML/H2O2 treatment curtails estrogenicity in vitro and substantially diminishes fish feminization in vivo. Our results provide a starting point for a future process in which tens of thousands of tonnes of wastewater could be treated per kilogram of catalyst. We suggest TAML/H2O2 is a worthy candidate for exploration as an environmentally compatible, versatile, method for removing EE2 and other pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewaters.

AB Our study details the investigation of real pharmaceutical wastewater (PhWW) treatment. A combination of the Fenton process, sand filtration, ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO) was tested. The sample of PhWW was highly polluted, containing high chemical oxygen demand (COD, 25,000 mg.L-1), total organic carbon (TOC, 4,940 mg.L-1), conductivity (kappa, 40,000 mg.L-1), and total N (4,054 mg.L-1) values. The pretreatment (Fenton, sand filter, UF) decreased the above parameters for 62%, 56%, 10%, and 88%, respectively. An additional membrane treatment was required since the values obtained in the pre-treatment were above maximum contaminant levels (MCLS). The next membrane step with the loose NF membrane (HL) COD, TOC, conductivity, and total N additionally decreased for 87%, 71%, 24%, and 32%, respectively. Tight NF (NF90, NF270) and RO (XLE) membranes were used in the final step and, according to the obtained parameters, membrane permeate streams could be discharged into the sewer without any risk to the ecosystem. Finally, and the most importantly, the combined methods of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment resulted in high recovery of more than 90%.

AB Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) belonging to analgesics, antibiotics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therapeutic classes were monitored in wastewater influents and effluents from two Portuguese urban wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) for 24 months. Both facilities were chosen due to their effluents are discharged in highly touristic and sensitive areas, Tagus river and Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, respectively. Target PhACs, acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethoxazole were measured using solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). PhACs occurrence in the influents was higher than 98%, with acetaminophen presenting the highest concentrations, with values between 16.3 mu g/L and 124 mu g/L. In the effluents, distinct behavior was observed with diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole showing recalcitrant characteristics, whereas acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen showed removal efficiencies above 95%. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen amount in influents showed consistently higher concentration levels in autumn (in Beirolas and Faro Nw UWWTPs) and winter (only in Beirolas UWWTP) seasons. These seasonal trends were observed to a greater extent in Beirolas UWWTP than in Faro Nw UWWTP. This study enabled the comprehensive definition of a behavior pattern for these target contaminants, contributing to better characterization and build-up a library of PhACs occurrence. It also allowed a robust seasonal profiling of the target compounds due to the high number of samples analyzed by each season and a longer monitoring campaign, making the obtained results more significant.

AB Microalgal cultivation has attracted global attention in recent years. It is a worldwide rapidly growing business sector due to the numerous applications of microalgae biomass and the valuable natural byproducts. Some of these products are used in pharmaceutical, biomedical, cosmetic, and food industries, and recently in biofuel production. The cost reduction of microalgal biomass production is an essential factor, and many studies have been focused on microalgae cultivation in wastewater. The selection of microalgae for biomass and lipid production is a very crucial factor. Chlorococcum sp. are common microalgae, found in wastewater. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of initial biomass concentration, air supply, and type and duration of light exposure of Chlorococcum sp. cultures in a high nutrient concentration synthetic wastewater. Experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions in order to investigate the removal of nutrients from wastewater, the biomass growth rates, and lipids accumulation in microalgae. The results of this study demonstrated that high initial biomass concentration is more efficient for lipid production. Specifically, higher lipids content (27.7%) was observed with high initial microalgae concentration, even though the phosphorus concentration was almost zero. Biomass production was increased faster at the higher air flow rate (6 L/min), without need for addition of carbon dioxide (CO2). The growth rate of Chlorococcum sp. was greater under artificial light compared to sunlight exposure, as well as the CO2 biofixation, since it is directly related to the algal biomass.

AB INTRODUCTION: There are increasing concerns over the presence and implications of pharmaceutical agents in water. In 2002, California banned pharmaceutical use of lindane because of concerns about water quality, as lindane treatment for head lice and scabies was found to be a significant factor adversely affecting wastewater quality.
   OBJECTIVES: In this article we describe the effects the ban has had on wastewater quality, unintentional exposures, and clinical practice. This is the first time that a pharmaceutical has been outlawed to protect water quality. As such, this ban provides a rare opportunity to evaluate the possible or potential outcomes of future public health interventions aimed at reducing pharmaceutical water contamination.
   METHODS: We compiled data on lindane in wastewater treatment plant effluent for several large plants in California and one outside of California. Data on exposures to lindane were obtained from records of the California Poison Control System. We assessed the impact on clinical practice via a survey of 400 pediatricians.
   RESULTS: Wastewater treatment plant monitoring showed that lindane declined in California after the ban. Similarly, unintentional exposure calls declined. Most physicians were aware of the ban (8 1 %) and had used lindane previously (61 %), but they did not notice any difficulties with the ban (78%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The California experience suggests that elimination of pharmaceutical lindane produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures, and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment. This ban serves as a model for governing bodies considering limits on the use of lindane or other pharmaceuticals.

AB Micropollutant removal in an algal treatment system fed with source separated wastewater streams was studied. Batch experiments with the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana grown on urine, anaerobically treated black water and synthetic urine were performed to assess the removal of six spiked pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, metoprolol, carbamazepine and trimethoprim). Additionally, incorporation of these pharmaceuticals and three estrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and ethinylestradiol) into algal biomass was studied. Biodegradation and photolysis led to 60-100% removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and metoprolol. Removal of carbamazepine and trimethoprim was incomplete and did not exceed 30% and 60%, respectively. Sorption to algal biomass accounted for less than 20% of the micropollutant removal. Furthermore, the presence of micropollutants did not inhibit C. sorokiniana growth at applied concentrations. Algal treatment systems allow simultaneous removal of micropollutants and recovery of nutrients from source separated wastewater. Nutrient rich algal biomass can be harvested and applied as fertilizer in agriculture, as lower input of micropollutants to soil is achieved when algal biomass is applied as fertilizer instead of urine.

AB This pilot-scale research project investigated and compared the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and other micropollutants from treated wastewater by ozone/biofiltration and reverse osmosis (RO). The reduction in UV254 absorbance as a function of ozone dose correlated well with the reduction in nonbiodegradable dissolved organic carbon and simultaneous production of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). BDOC analyses demonstrated that ozone does not mineralize organics in treated wastewater and that biofiltration can remove the organic oxidation products of ozonation. Biofiltration is recommended for treatment of ozone contactor effluent to minimize the presence of unknown micropollutant oxidation products in the treated water. Ozone/biofiltration and RO were compared on the basis of micropollutant removal efficiency, energy consumption, and waste production. Ozone doses of 4-8 mg/L were nearly as effective as RO for removing micropollutants. When wider environmental impacts such as energy consumption, water recovery, and waste production are considered, ozone/biofiltration may be a more desirable process than RO for removing PPCPs and other trace organics from treated wastewater.

AB In this study, we comparatively investigated the degradation of 12 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) processes. Second-order rate constants for the reactions of iopromide, phenytoin, caffeine, benzotriazole, and primidone with sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) were determined for the first time. Experiments were conducted in buffered pure water and wastewater effluent with spiked TOrCs. UV/PDS degraded all TOrCs more efficiently than UV/H2O2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of SO4 center dot- than that of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) at the same initial molar dose of PDS and H2O2, respectively. UV/PDS showed higher selectivity toward TOrCs removal than UV/H2O2 in wastewater effluent. Compounds with electron-rich moieties, such as diclofenac, venlafaxine, and metoprolol, were eliminated faster in UV/PDS whereas UV/H2O2 was more efficient in degrading compounds with lower reactivity to SO4 center dot-. The fluence-based rate constants (k(obs-UV/H2O2)) of TOrCs in wastewater effluent linearly increased as a function of initial H2O2 dose during UV/H2O2, possibly due to the constant scavenging impact of the wastewater matrix on (OH)-O-center dot. However, exponential increase of k(obs-UV/PDS) with increasing PDS dose was observed for most compounds during UV/PDS, suggesting the decreasing scavenging effect of the water matrix (electron-rich site of effluent organic matter (EfOM)) after initial depletion of SO4 center dot- at low PDS dose. Fulvic and humic-like fluorophores appeared to be more persistent during UV/H2O2 compared to aromatic protein and soluble microbial product-like fluorophores. In contrast, UV/PDS efficiently degraded all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward the fluorescent EfOM components. Removal pattern of TOrCs during pilot-scale UV/PDS was consistent with lab-scale experiments, however, overall removal rates were lower due to the presence of higher concentration of EfOM and nitrite.

AB Significant amounts of pharmaceuticals are discharged into the environment through wastewater effluent. Sorption has been shown to be a significant aqueous removal pathway for many of these compounds. Competition between ciprofloxacin (CIP), ofloxacin (OFL) and norfloxacin (NOR) and their sorption to, and desorption from, a surrogate Louisiana wastewater treatment wetland soil were investigated to gain insight into the fate and transport of the pollutants within wastewater treatment wetlands. This study was undertaken in the context of a treatment wetland that continuously receives pharmaceuticals. Therefore it is important to understand the total capacity of this soil to sorb these compounds. Sorption to this treatment wetland soil was found to provide a major and potentially long-term removal pathway for these antibiotics from wastewater. Log K-F values for all three compounds were between 4.09 and 3.90 for sorption and 4.24 and 4.05 mu g(1-1/n) (cm(3))(1/n) g(-1) for desorption. The compounds were sorbed in amounts ranging from 60% to 90% for high and low loading, respectively. The majority of the compounds were sorbed to the soil within the first 20 h, indicating that treatment wetland may not need long retention times (weeks to months) in order to remove these compounds. Sorption K-D values for competition (20 ppm of each compound for 60 ppm of total fluoroquinolones) ranged from 2300 to 3800 cm(3) g(-1) which is between both the 20 (4300-5800 cm(3) g(-1)) and 60 (1300-3000 cm(3) g(-1)) ppm single compound K-D values, indicating that there is competition between these three compound for sorption sites. Sorption and desorption data (single component and mixture) collectively provide the following evidence: (1) NOR and, to a lesser extent, CIP outcompete OFL for sorption sites, (2) OFL sorbes to its share of "quality" sorption sites, and (3) competition only occurs for lesser "quality" binding sites.

AB This study investigated the occurrence, removal and risk of 42 organic micropollutants (MPs), including 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 12 endocrine disrupting chemicals, in 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) distributed across China. The composition profiles of different MP categories in the influent, effluent, and excess sludge were explored and the aqueous removal efficiencies of MPs were determined. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed to compare the efficacies of different wastewater treatment processes in eliminating MPs. Results indicate that different MP categories showed quite similar distributions among the studied WWTPs, with phenolic estrogenic compounds (PEs), macrolides, and fluoroquinolones being always dominant in the influent, effluent and excess sludge. Tetracyclines, bezafibrate, caffeine, steroid estrogens, and PEs showed high and stable aqueous removal efficiencies, whereas other MPs showed considerably varied aqueous removal efficiencies. Anaerobic/anoxic/oxic process combined with a moving-bed biofilm reactor achieved the highest aqueous removal of MPs among various secondary treatment processes. A combined process consisting of ultrafiltration, ozonation and CIO2 disinfection resulted in the highest removal of MPs among the tertiary treatment processes. Sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, estrone, and bisphenol A in the effluent, as well as beta-estradiol 3-sulfate in the excess sludge could pose high risks. This study draws an overall picture about the current status of MPs in WWTPs across China and provides useful information for better control of the risks associated with MPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work has assessed the seasonal changes and the dynamics in the concentration of six pharmaceutical compounds during photolysis as a tertiary treatment of sewage previously treated by an anaerobic/aerobic system comprising a UASB (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactor and a trickling filter (TF). The target compounds were four antibiotics (ciprofloxacin (CPF), clindamycin (CLM), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimetoprim), one beta-blocker (atenolol), and one anti-inflammatory (diclofenac (DCF)). Six hydraulic retention times (HRTs) were evaluated (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min) with the intent of varying the ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation doses applied to the effluent from biological treatment containing the target contaminants. The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds in the effluent of the UASB/TF system were in agreement with the concentration levels reported in the literature. Aside from DCF, the seasonality seems to be a preponderant characteristic regarding the pharmaceutical concentration found in the effluent of biological treatment systems. The radiation dose of 117 mJ cm(-2) seemed to be most suited for the photolysis application to tertiary treatment of domestic effluents. It was observed that lower UVC doses led to deconjugation of pharmaceuticals, which can result in increased concentrations of target pollutants in the photoreactor effluent.

AB Olive oil is produced by a technological procedure based on physical operations, without use of chemicals. This industry is concerned to make the whole process environmentally friendly, which includes the treatment of the wastewater produced in the mills. In the present work, the isolation, purification and recovery of high-added value phenolic compounds from two-phase olive-oil washing wastewater (OOWW) and the simultaneous effluent treatment by a 'green process' based on resins adsorption/ion exchange (strong-base anionic Amberlyst A26 (R), weak-base anionic. Dowex 66 (R) and non-ionic macroreticular Amberlite XAD4 (R)) was studied. Results showed the resins performances were optimal at the raw effluent pH and ambient temperature conditions, thus no acidification or basification, nor cooling or heating, would be necessary: the effluent could be directly driven from the exit of the vertical centrifuges at the outlet temperature and raw pH to the proposed resins process, boosting the economic feasibility. The strong anionic resin ensured optimum results: upon 150 min maximum contact time and 60-80 g resin/L, a final treated effluent containing only 8.7 mg/L total phenolic compounds was obtained. The effluent could be partially discharged on suitable terrains or disposed to biological treatments, avoiding phytotoxicity or inhibition due to the phenolic content. The obtention of this concentrated pool of added-value antioxidant compounds for food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biotechnological industrial sectors could help counter-balance the economic feasibility of the reclamation process.

AB Anaerobic processes have been successfully used in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater. However, the effect of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus on specific methanogenic activity (SMA) in anaerobic treatment of wastewaters containing phenol has not been systematically investigated. Phenol is present in industrial effluents like coal gasification, coke production, pharmaceutical, pesticide, fertilizer, dye manufacturing, synthetic chemical, and pulp and paper. This paper presents experimental study on determination of SMA using phenol as a sole substrate and the present work is being compared with the studies carried out by various researchers using different substrates. SMA test was carried out immediately after seeding the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor with sludge in order to determine the initial phenol biodegradation during the start-up phase of the reactor. Anaerobic degradation of phenol to methane takes place via benzoate and then to acetate. Therefore, the SMA was determined by taking benzoate as well as acetate as substrates. The SMA of acetate was found less than that of benzoate. Therefore, for the SMA in case of phenol biodegradation the conversion of phenol to benzoate has been shown to be rate liming step. Based on the SMA test and COD removal the optimum COD:N:P ratio for anaerobic treatment of phenolic wastewater is proposed to be 300:1:0.1. Also, to increase the performance of the system and to achieve stable conditions an organic loading rate of 0.40 kg COD/m(3) d was tested and resulted in 98% COD removal. This study will be very helpful in maintaining optimum organic load and COD:N:P ratio for enhanced removal of phenol from wastewater.

AB Comparison of electrochemical processes at pilot plant scale for the elimination of organic microcontaminants in actual urban wastewater treatment plant secondary effluents pre-treated by nanofiltration ([Cl-] = 1100-2000 mg L-1) membranes (for reducing total volume to be treated and increase water salinity), has been addressed. Anodic oxidation (AO), solar-assisted AO, electro Fenton (EF) and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF) processes have been evaluated by using, when required, ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) as complexing agent to maintain iron in solution at natural pH. Target water was spiked with a mix solution of microcontaminants: pentachlorophenol, terbutryn, chlorfenvinphos and diclofenac at initial concentrations of 500 and 100 mu g L-1, each. AO and EF processes obtained similar degradation rates as added EDDS competed with microcontaminants for oxidant species. SPEF and solar assisted AO showed that high chloride concentrations was a crucial factor since chlorine species generated by solar-assisted AO were enough for efficient microcontaminant removal avoiding the addition of EDDS. Degradation monitoring of microcontaminants contained in actual urban wastewater treatment plant effluents was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) are pervasive anthropogenic contaminants of receiving waters where they can induce various adverse effects to aquatic life. Their ubiquitous environmental occurrence is primarily attributed to discharge from wastewater treatment plants due to incomplete removal by common biological wastewater treatment processes. Here, we assess a new strategy for promoting the degradation of six representative OMPs (i.e., sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, tylosin, atrazine, naproxen, and ibuprofen) by intentionally stimulating the production of microbial oxidoreductases to counter oxidative stress caused by oxygen perturbations. Mixed microbial cultures from a dairy farm wastewater were subjected to cyclic perturbations of dissolved oxygen (DO). A distance-based redundancy analysis was used to show that DO perturbations correlate with the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, activities of peroxidases and cytochromes, and the degradation of OMPs. DO perturbation of 0.25 and 0.5 cycles/h led to most abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, showed higher activity of peroxidase and cytochrome, and gave largest removal of OMPs (removal of 92 +/- 3% for sulfamethoxazole, 84 +/- 3% for naproxen, 82 +/- 3% for ibuprofen, 66 +/- 2% for carbamazepine, 57 +/- 15% for tylosin, and 88 +/- 1% for atrazine).

AB In this study, the treatment process of three cosmetic wastewater types has been investigated. Coagulation allowed to achieve chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 74.6%, 37.7% and 74.0% for samples A (Al-2(SO4)(3)), B (Brentafloc F3) and C (PAX 16), respectively. The Fenton process proved to be effective as well - COD removal was equal to 75.1%, 44.7% and 68.1%, respectively. Coagulation with FeCl3 and the subsequent photo-Fenton process resulted in the best values of final COD removal equal to 92.4%, 62.8% and 90.2%. In case of the Fenton process, after coagulation these values were equal to 74.9%, 50.1% and 84.8%, while in case of the H2O2/UV process, the obtained COD removal was 83.8%, 36.2% and 80.9%. High value of COD removal in the Fenton process carried out for A and C wastewater samples was caused by a significant contribution of the final neutralization/coagulation. Very small effect of the oxidation reaction in the Fenton process in case of sample A resulting from the presence of antioxidants, OH radical scavengers' in the wastewater.

AB The growing demand on water resources has increased the interest in wastewater reclamation for multiple end-use applications such as indirect and direct potable reuse. In these applications, the removal of organic micropollutants is of a greater concern than in conventional wastewater treatment. This article presents a collection of data of trace organic micropollutants in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in North East Spain using reverse osmosis (RO) membrane treatment. The RO rejection values of the organic molecules studied with a wide range of solute size and hydrophobicity were determined. Several chromatographic methods monitoring different endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were used. Results indicated that secondary effluents from this Spanish WWTP contained most of the studied organic compounds indicating incomplete removal of organics in the conventional treatment of the plant. However, the rejection of most micropollutants was high for all three RO membrane types (low energy, high rejection, fouling resistant) tested. It was observed that some selected micropollutants were less efficiently removed (e.g. the small and polar and the more hydrophobic) and the molecular weight and membrane material influenced removal efficiencies.

AB A process involving the use of membrane bioreactor seeded with aerobic granular sludge (GMBR) was applied to the treatment of sewage containing pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The removal effects of five kinds of medicines in the reactor were investigated, and the microbial communities were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. We also determined the effects of different sludge retention and hydraulic retention times (SRT and HRT, respectively) and influent organic loading on GMBR's efficiency in processing sewage containing PPCPs. The removal effects of the GMBR on five PPCPs varied. Using the GMBR, the removal rates of prednisolone, naproxen and norfloxacin were 98.56, 84.02 and 87.85 %, respectively. The removal rates of sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen were 77.83 and 63.32 %, respectively. In the system, PPCP drugs had relatively less effect on microbial diversity. A certain succession was observed in the structural variation of microbial species in the GMBR. Microorganisms that can degrade PPCPs gradually accumulated, and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, such as Firmicutes sp., Aeromonas sp. and Nitrospira sp., served a key function in the treatment of sewage containing antibiotics. Long SRT and HRT during the GMBR process can facilitate the removal of most PPCPs. The system efficiently removed PPCPs at high influent organic loading.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are two groups of emerging pollutants the significance of which rests on their persistent detection in the aquatic environment and their possible adverse effects. Wastewater treatment plants are one of the major ways for transporting such chemicals in the aquatic environment. Chlorination is usually the last stage of treatment before wastewater being disposed to the aquatic environment. This work focuses on the evaluation of the effect of chlorine dose and specific wastewater characteristics (pH, total suspended solids and humic acids) on the removal of target EDCs and NSAIDs through chlorination. Another objective of this study is the identification of chlorination by-products of specific EDCs and NSAIDs and their dependence on contact time. Based on the results it is concluded that the effect of chlorine dose and humic acids concentration on the degradation of target compounds during chlorination is minimal. On the contrary, pH is a critical parameter which highly affects process performance. Moreover, it is concluded that not only the free available chlorine species, but also the properties of EDCs and NSAIDs under different pH conditions can affect chlorination process performance. The effect of TSS on the degradation of the target compounds during chlorination is more profound for chemicals with high Kow values and therefore higher affinity to partition to the particulate phase (i.e. nonylphenols, triclosan). Several degradation by-products were identified through chlorination of nonylphenol, bisphenol A and diclofenac. The dependence of these by-products on chlorination contact time is also demonstrated.

AB Newly available prescription data has been used along with census data to develop a localised method for predicting pharmaceutical concentrations in sewage influent and effluent for England, and applied to a case study: the steroid estrogens estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in a selected catchment. The prescription data allows calculation of the mass consumed of synthetic estrogens, white use of highly localised census data improves predictions of naturally excreted estrogens by accounting for regional variations in population demographics. This serves two key purposes; to increase the accuracy of predictions in general, and to call attention to the need for more accurate predictions at a localised and/or catchment level, especially in light of newly proposed regulatory measures which may in the future require removal of steroid estrogens by sewage treatment facilities. In addition, the general lack of measured sewage works data necessitated the development of a novel approach which allowed comparison of localised predictions to average national measurements of influent and effluent. Overall in the case study catchment, estrogen predictions obtained using the model described herein were within 95% confidence intervals of measured values drawn from across the UK, with large improvements to predictions of EE2 being made compared with previous predictive methods.

AB The prediction of risks posed by pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic environment now and in the future is one of the top 20 research questions regarding these contaminants following growing concern for their biological effects. on fish and other animals. To this end it is important that areas experiencing the greatest risk are identified, particularly in countries experiencing water stress, where dilution of pollutants entering river networks is more limited. This study is the first to use hydrological models to estimate concentrations of pharmaceutical and natural steroid estrogens in a water stressed catchment in South Australia alongside a UK catchment and to forecast their concentrations in 2050 based on demographic and climate change predictions The results show that despite their differing climates and demographics, modeled concentrations of steroid estrogens in effluents from Australian sewage treatment works and a receiving river were predicted (simulated) to be similar to those observed in the UK and Europe, exceeding the combined estradiol equivalent's predicted no effect concentration for feminization in wild fish. Furthermore, by 2050 a moderate increase in estrogenic contamination and the potential risk to wildlife was predicted with up to a 2-fold rise in concentrations.

AB One of the most common ways of getting rid of sewage sludge is land spreading on agricultural fields as a source of nutrients and organic matter. However, sewage sludge may be contaminated with pharmaceuticals and can represent a cause of environmental contamination. The objectives of this study was (i) to determine the occurrence and the fate of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics belonging to different classes: antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxypyridazine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, tylosin, trimethoprim), anti-inflammatories (diclofenac) and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine) in the soil after spreading stabilized sludge (composted, limed and digested) and solid digestat, (ii) to evaluate agronomic benefits and (iii) to determine the potential ecotoxicological consequences of pharmaceutical compounds on the environment using a risk quotient approach. For this purpose, four different types of sludge samples, coming from the same treatment plant but submitted to different stabilization processes, were incorporated into three soils with different physicochemical characteristics and pedogenetic factors. The obtained results highlighted that the sludge treatments have a great influence on sludge contamination. Once applied onto the soil, the agronomic benefits will depend on the soil's properties as well as the sludge's characteristics. The risks concerning the ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals, found in the sludge, are low but not insignificant.

AB Synthetic sewage containing high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs, mg/L level) was treated using an anoxic/aerobic (A/O) reactor coupled with a microbial fuel cell (MFC) at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h. A novel design of solid plain graphite plates (SPGRPs) was used for the high surface area biodegradation of the PPCP-containing sewage and for the generation of electricity. The average CODCr and total nitrogen removal efficiencies achieved were 97.20% and 83.75%, respectively. High removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals, including acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole, were also obtained and ranged from 98.21% to 99.89%. A maximum power density of 532.61 mW/cm(2) and a maximum coulombic efficiency of 25.20% were measured for the SPGRP MFC at the anode. Distinct differences in the bacterial community were presented at various locations including the mixed liquor suspended solids and biofilms. The bacterial groups involved in PPCP biodegradation were identified as Dechloromonas spp., Sphingomonas sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This design, which couples an A/O reactor with a novel design of SPGRP MFC, allows the simultaneous removal of PPCPs and successful electricity production.

AB Thirteen pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds have been surveyed along the different units of a municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) to study their fate across each step and the overall removal efficiency. The STP studied corresponds to a population of approximately 100,000 inhabitants located in Galicia (northwest Spain), including three main sections: pre-treatment (coarse and fine screening, grit and fat removal); primary treatment (sedimentation tanks); and secondary treatment (conventional activated sludge). Among all the substances considered (galaxolide, tonalide, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, estrone, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, roxitromycin, sulfamethoxazole and iopromide), only significant concentrations were found for two musks (galaxolide and tonalide), two antiphlogistics (ibuprofen and naproxen), two natural estrogens (estrone, estradiol), one antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole) and the X-ray contrast media (iopromide), being the other compounds below the quantification level. In the primary treatment, only the fragrances were partly removed, with efficiencies of 20-50% for galaxolide and tonalide. However, the aerobic treatment caused an important reduction in all compounds detected, between 35 and 75%, with the exception of iopromide. The overall removal efficiency of the STP ranged between 70 and 90% for the fragrances, 45 and 70% for the acidic compounds, around 67% for estradiol and 57% for the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole.

AB A bacterium was isolated from activated sewage sludge that has the ability to use ibuprofen as its sole carbon and energy source. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the strain in the Variovorax genus within the beta-proteobacteria. When grown on ibuprofen it accumulated a transient yellow intermediate that disappeared upon acidification, a trait consistent with meta ring-fission metabolites. GC/MS analysis of derivatized culture supernatant yielded two spectra consistent with trihydroxyibuprofen bearing all three hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring. These metabolites were only detected when 3-fluorocatechol, a meta ring-fission inhibitor, was added to Ibu-1 cultures and the supernatant was then derivatized with aqueous acetic anhydride and diazomethane. These findings suggest the possibility of ibuprofen metabolism proceeding via a trihydroxyibuprofen meta ring-fission pathway. Identical spectra, consistent with these putative ring-hydroxylated trihydroxyibuprofen metabolites, were also obtained from ibuprofen-spiked sewage sludge, but only when it was poisoned with 3-fluorocatechol. The presence of the same trihydroxylated metabolites in both spiked sewage sludge and culture supernatants suggests that this trihydroxyibuprofen extradiol ring-cleavage pathway for the degradation of ibuprofen may have environmental relevance.

AB This study features the simultaneous extraction and quantification of 18 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). This is a pioneering method for the quantification of acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, atenolol, metoprolol, diethyltoluamide and oxybenzone in atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mode. The method was validated for high repeatability and reproducibility with relative standard deviations less than 10%. Instrument quantification limits for PPCPs were within the range of 0.05-1.0 mu gL(-1), and the method quantification limits (MQLs) for ultrapure water were within the range of 0.3-15ngL(-1). All samples were extracted using Oasis (c) hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced cartridges with optimised sample size and extraction conditions. Good accuracy was demonstrated, with solid-phase extraction recoveries above 80% for most PPCPs. In environmental matrices, the MQLs for river water, sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and STP influent were 4-25, 10-153 and 38-386.5, respectively. The method was successfully applied to investigate occurrences of persistent PPCPs in Malaysian river and sewage samples.

AB The implementation of latest International Maritime Organization emission standard raised stringent requirements for marine domestic sewage discharge. In this study, an air-lift multilevel circulation membrane reactor (AMCMBR) was operated to analyze effects of various ecological factors on effluent of marine domestic sewage. Back-propagation (BP)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to simulate effect of each ecological factor on reactor performance. The activities of four enzymes were investigated to reveal microbial activities in reactor. Experimental results indicates that the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), Mixed Liquid Suspended Solids (MLSS) and pH value cannot be less than 4 h, 3000 mg/L and 6, respectively to meet the IMO emission standard for effluent COD. A small value of mean square error (0.00147) indicated that BP-ANN can well describe the relationship between operation parameters (influent COD, HRT, MLSS, and pH) and effluent COD. The order of relative importance was pH approximate to MLSS > HRT > influent COD. Polyphenol oxidase and urease can serve as indicating factors for reactor performance, whereas dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase showed less susceptible towards varied influent COD and MLSS.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate thermal and physicochemical parameters of sewage sludge palm waste mixtures contaminated by different families of antibiotics (tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) during co-composting. Sludge was spiked with chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), roxithromycin (RXY), enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Antibiotics were spiked at a low level, medium level, high level and a control without antibiotics was conducted. The results showed that the organic matter degradation was delayed and the carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratio was affected by an increase of the antibiotics concentration. The presence of antibiotics, especially at high level, delayed the coming of the temperature maxima, and disturbed the thermophilic phase. The calorific model showed that the heat release is affected during the thermophilic phase when high antibiotics concentrations were used. In addition, the microbiological approach showed that the adsorption of antibiotics on the rachis could be probably responsible of the fungi inhibition especially during the maturation phase. Therefore, the medium and high levels of antibiotics affected the thermal, physical and chemical parameters as well as the compost quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a need to develop viable techniques for removal and/or recovery of organic and inorganic compounds from environmental matrices, due to their eco-toxicity, regulatory obligations or potential supplies as secondary materials. Simultaneous phosphorus (P) recovery and removal of emerging organic contaminants (caffeine, bisphenol A, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and oxybenzone) from sewage sludge (SS) was assessed using the electrodialytic (ED) process. The SS samples were collected at the secondary settling tank between May and July, 2015. Different current intensities were tested continuously or sequentially (between 50, 75 and 100 mA), in a 2 compartment cell, placing the SS in the cathode end, separated from the anode end through an anion exchange membrane. After 24 h, between 45 and 55% of P electromigrated to the anode end in all experiments and the application of higher current intensities did not promote significant improvements in its recovery. After 72 h, the best results were obtained when 100 mA (0.21 mA/cm(2)) were applied: 70% of P were recovered in the anolyte and between 79 and 96% of organic compounds were degraded.

AB The sorption and biodegradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), in an activated sludge system were investigated. Experiments were carried out by contacting 100 mu g/L of each sulfonamide compound individually with 2.56 g/L of MLSS at 25 +/- 0.5 degrees C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen of 3.0 +/- 0.1 mg/L in a batch reactor over different periods of 2 d and 14 d. All sulfonamides were removed completely over 11-13 d. Sorptive equilibrium was established well within the first few hours, followed by a lag period of 1-3 days before biodegradation was to deplete the antibiotic compounds linearly in the ensuing 10 days. Apparent zeroth-order rate constants were obtained by regression analysis of measured aqueous concentration vs. time profiles to a kinetic model accounting for sorption and biodegradation; they were 8.1, 7.9, and 7.7 mu g/L/d for SDM, SMX, and SMM, respectively, at activated sludge concentration of 2.56 g/L. The measured kinetics implied that with typical hydraulic retention time (e.g. 6 h) provided by WWTP the removal of sulfonamide compounds from the wastewater during the activated sludge process would approximate 2 mu g/L.

AB We present a process model that predicts the removal of the antibiotic micropollutants, sulfa methoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TCY), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), in an activated sludge treatment system. A novel method was developed to solve the inverse problem of inferring process rate, sorption, and correction factor parameter values from batch experimental results obtained under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Instead of spiking the batch reactors with reference substances, measurements were made using the xenobiotic organic micropollutant content of preclarified municipal sewage. Parent compound formation and removal were observed, and the model developed using the simulation software West showed limited efficiency to describe the selected micropollutants profiles, when growth substrate removal occurs. The model structure was optimized by accounting for competitive inhibition by readily biodegradable substrates on the cometabolic micropollutant biotransformation processes. Our results suggest that underanoxic conditions, hydrophobicity-independent mechanisms can significantly impact solid-liquid partitioning that our model takes into account by using the sorption coefficient as a lumped parameter. Forward dynamic simulations were carried out to evaluate the developed model and to confirm it for SMX using data obtained in a full-scale treatment plant. Evaluation of measured and simulation results suggest that, robust model prediction can be achieved by approximating the influent load of chemicals biodegrading via a given parent compound, e.g., human conjugates, as an antibiotic mass that is proportional to the parent compound load.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has become a global concern, as it poses a threat to the environment, especially to the aquatic ecosystem. This study focused on 30 PPCPs found in the Baiyangdian basin of the Xiong'an New Area, in the core of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, with intensive human interventions during two seasons. In general, 30 PPCPs were all frequently detected, ranging from 42.3 to 7710 ng/L in May and 48.9 to 1300 ng/L in November. Sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin, anhydro-erythromycin, carbamazepine, caffeine, and were screened as the predominant PPCPs. The rivers input was an essential source of PPCPs. The source apportionment with a series of analytical methods revealed that domestic sewage was the primary source, and untreated water also crucial for PPCPs contamination. The risk assessment suggested carbamazepine, caffeine, ofloxacin, and anhydro-erythromycin exhibited relatively high ecological risks for protecting most species such as algae, fish, and flowers in the aquatic ecosystem, especially near the outlet of WWTPs. Thus, management strategies for such PPCPs will be needed. Intensive human interventions, including a prohibition of fish breeding, water diversion project, and wastewater treatment in villages, were having an effective role in alleviating PPCPs contamination.

AB The presence of pharmaceutic compounds has been widely detected in water and wastewater due to the increase in their production and consumption. Since conventional treatments are not able to totally remove these microcontaminants, more efficient technologies, such as adsorption, must be investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the adsorption of diclofenac sodium (DS) onto commercial organoclay (Spectrogel (R) Type C) in static system. Process optimization was performed through Central Composite Design (CCD) and the adsorbent mass of 0.5 g and agitation speed of 200 rpm were selected as the optimum conditions. The variable initial concentration of DS was not statistically significant. Pseudo-first order model showed the best correlation to kinetic experimental data and the investigation of adsorption mechanism revealed that external mass transference was the main rate-controlling step. Equilibrium data obtained at 15 degrees C and at 30 degrees C were best described by Freundlich isotherm model and at 50 degrees C by Temkin isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity from Langmuir was of 0.133 mmol/L at 50 degrees C. Thermodynamically, the process is spontaneous and endothermic. Characterization analysis depicted that DS adsorption takes place on the surface of Spectrogel, which is not significantly modified by the process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of eight pharmaceutical compounds in biosolids from urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was developed and validated. The compounds evaluated were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen), lipid regulators (clofibric acid), and antibiotics (sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethazine, and sulfamethoxazole). Ultrasound assisted extraction with a water-methanol solvent mixture (1:1, v:v) was performed and the compounds were then determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The design of the method was based on the application of the standard addition calibration methodology to reduce matrix interferences. Validation procedures were conducted with rabbit excrements as blank samples. Recoveries of the target analytes ranged from 76 to 131% in spiked samples at 50, 200 or 1000ngg(-1) dry weight (dw). The relative standard deviations were in the range of 5-15% and the method detection limits ranged from 2 to 12ngg(-1)dw. The method was applied to monitor pharmaceutical concentrations in biosolids from different WWTPs over an eight-month period (May to December 2011). Diclofenac, sulfapyridine and ibuprofen were detected in most of the samples whereas sulfamethazine and ibuprofen were the pharmaceuticals found in the highest concentrations (>200ngg(-1) dw on average).

AB The propagation of antibiotic resistance is a challenge for human health worldwide, which has drawn much attention on the reduction of the resistance genes. To understand their occurrence during different treatment processes, in this study, four classes of antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, quinolones, and macrolides), eight antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (tetB, tetW, sul1, sul2, gyrA, qepA, ermB, and ermF), and two mobile elements (int1 and int2) were investigated in a typical pharmaceutical plant. The total concentrations of antibiotics were detected in the range of 2.6x10(2) to 2.5x10(3)ng/L in the treatment processes, and the high abundance of ARGs was detected in the biological treatment unit. The dynamic trend analysis showed that antibiotics were partially removed in the anaerobic/aerobic processes, where ARGs were proliferated. The abundance of tetB and gyrA genes was positively correlated with pH and EC (p<0.05), and the tetW, sul1 and sul2 genes were significantly correlated with TOC, TN, and DO (p<0.05), indicating the influence of physicochemical properties of the solution on the levels of ARG subtypes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the tetW clones had high homology with some pathogenic microorganisms, such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Neisseria meningitides, which would threaten human health. Results indicated that the horizontal transfer acted as a major driver in the ARGs evolution.

AB In-sewer transformation of drug biomarkers (excreted parent drugs and metabolites) can be influenced by the presence of biomass in suspended form as well as attached to sewer walls (biofilms). Biofilms are likely the most abundant and biologically active biomass fraction in sewers. In this study, 16 drug biomarkers were selected, including the parent forms and the major human metabolites of mephedrone, methadone, cocaine, heroin, codeine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Transformation and sorption of these substances were assessed in targeted batch experiments using laboratory-scale biofilm reactors operated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A one-dimensional model was developed to simulate diffusive transport, abiotic and biotic transformation, and partitioning of drug biomarkers. Model calibration to experimental results allowed estimating biotransformation rate constants in sewer biofilms, which were compared to those obtained for suspended biomass. Our results suggest that sewer biofilms can enhance the biotransformation compounds. Through scenario simulations, we demonstrated that the estimation of biotransformation rate constants in biofilm can be significantly biased if the boundary layer thickness is not accurately estimated. This study complements our previous investigation on the transformation and sorption of drug biomarkers in the presence of only suspended biomass in untreated sewage. A better understanding of the role of sewer biofilms also relative to the in-sewer suspended solids and improved prediction of associated fate processes can result in more accurate estimation of daily drug consumption in urban areas in wastewater-based epidemiological assessments.

AB Comparison of the rejection of trace tetracycline (TC) in the secondary effluent of an anoxic-oxic (AO) system by forward osmosis (FO) was investigated at the mini-lab scale. The effects of different operating conditions including membrane orientation, flow velocity, and draw solution concentration and solute on TC rejection were also explored. The results revealed that TC rejection increased with increasing water flux, but high reverse salt flux may reduce TC rejection through enhanced solution ionic strength. Membranes with a nonwoven structure could reduce TC rejection via increased flow velocity. In the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode, rejection of charged TC was higher than in the FO mode because of enhanced electrostatic repulsion. In addition, the reverse draw solute could hinder the forward diffusion of TC, thus leading to a decline in TC rejection. The cellulose triacetate with embedded polyester screen (CTA-ES) membrane displayed consistently higher TC rejection than that of the cellulose triacetate with a cast nonwoven (CTA-NW) membrane, and the rejection of TC by a thin-film composite with embedded polyester screen (TFC-ES) membrane was relatively lower compared to CTA membranes. These findings provide further insight into TC rejection mechanisms and potentially can be useful for FO process operation in wastewater reclamation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human pharmaceutical residues are a serious environmental concern. They have been reported to have eco, geno, and human toxic effects, and thus their importance as micropollutants cannot be ignored. These have been studied extensively in Europe and North America. However, African countries are still lagging behind in research on these micropollutants. In this study, the wastewaters of the University Teaching Hospital of Yaounde (UTHY) were screened for the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients and their metabolites. The screening was carried out using two methods: high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole analyzer (LC/QQQ) and high-performance coupled to a mass spectrometer with a time of flight analyzer (LC/Q-TOF). A total of 19 active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites were identified and quantified. The compounds identified include paracetamol (211.93g/L), ibuprofen (141g/L), tramadol (76g/L), O-demethyltramadol (141g/L), erythromycinanhydrate (7g/L), ciprofloxacin (24g/L), clarinthromycine (0.088g/L), azitromycine (0.39g/L), sulfamethoxazole 0.16g/L), trimetoprime (0.27g/L), caffeine (5.8g/L), carnamaeepine (0.94g/L), atenolol (0.43g/L), propranolol (0.3g/L), cimetidine (34g/L), hydroxy omeprazole (5g/L), diphenhydramine (0.38g/L), metformine (154g/L), and sucralose (13.07g/L).

AB Research addressing the occurrence, fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, primarily due to the development of improved chemical analysis methods. Significant research gaps still remain, however, including a lack of longer term, repeated monitoring of rivers, determination of temporal and spatial changes in pharmaceutical concentrations, and inputs from sources other than wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). In addressing these gaps it was found that the five pharmaceuticals studied were routinely (51-94% of the time) present in effluents and receiving waters at concentrations ranging from single ng to mu g L-1. Mean concentrations were in the tens to hundreds ng L-1 range and CSOs appear to be a significant source of pharmaceuticals to water courses in addition to WWTPs. Receiving water concentrations varied throughout the day although there were no pronounced peaks at particular times. Similarly, concentrations varied throughout the year although no consistent patterns were observed. No dissipation of the study compounds was found over a 5 km length of river despite no other known inputs to the river. In conclusion, pharmaceuticals are routinely present in semi-rural and urban rivers and require management alongside more traditional pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater containing pesticides released to water courses without any previous treatment produces an extremely negative impact into the environment, causing concern among the population and authorities. Imazalil (IMZ) is a post-harvest fungicide used on a myriad of fruit crops; it is classified as "likely to be carcinogenic in humans" and produce a negative impact on the biota. In this work we propose a coupled solar Fenton-Biological process in a pilot plant for the treatment of water containing the fungicide IMZ and organic coadjutants. Water solutions containing up to 500 mg/L IMZ, 500 mgC/L TOC and 1300-1400 mgO(2)/L COD were partially oxidized by Solar-Fenton process. For the first time, the efficiency of the treatment in the Buenos Aires area during different seasons was studied. In summer the treatment was faster but less efficient than in winter. Organic compounds were converted to organic acids like malic, formic and oxalic acids. The resultant solution was biodegraded using consortium adapted to IMZ oxidation byproducts without the incorporation of any extra carbon sources. As a result of the treatment TOC and COD were reduced to acceptable values for discharge in sewage, and its toxicity (determined by assays on Lactuca sativa L.) was significantly decreased. These results exemplified the advantages of combining advanced oxidation with the biological process for recalcitrant compounds degradation.

AB Agricultural crops have a long history of being irrigated with recycled wastewater (RW). However, its use on vegetable crops has been of concern due to the potential prevalence of microcontaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the latter, which represents a possible health hazard to consumers. We investigated the uptake of three PPCPs (atenolol, diclofenac, and ofloxacin), at three different concentrations in irrigation water (0.5, 5, and 25 mu g L-1) in relation to three varying volumetric soil moisture depletion levels of 14 % (-4.26 kPa), 10 % (-8.66 kPa), and 7 % (-18.37 kPa) by various vegetable crop species. Experiments were conducted in a split-split block completely randomized design. PPCPs were extracted using a developed method of accelerated solvent extraction and solid phase extraction and analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Results indicate that all treated crops were capable of PPCP uptake at nanogram per gram concentrations independent of the applied soil moisture depletion levels and PPCP concentrations. Ofloxacin was the chemical with the highest uptake amounts, followed by atenolol and then diclofenac. Although the results were not statistically significant, higher concentrations of PPCPs were detected in plants maintained under higher soil moisture levels of 14 % (-4.26 kPa).

AB In South America, there is a lack of data concerning the occurrence and levels of pharmaceuticals in main rivers as well as their negative effects on the biota. Here we report the occurrence as well as the spatial and temporal variations of some common prescribed pharmaceuticals in the Suquia River basin (Cordoba, Argentina). We also report the bioconcentration of two of them in Gambusia affinis, a widely distributed fish species inhabiting the river basin. The influence of the wastewater treatment plant of Cordoba City was critical (up to 70 km downstream). Among 15 compounds analyzed, atenolol, carbamazepine and diclofenac were the most frequently detected (reaching sub mu g L-1 levels), showing different distribution patterns. Bioconcentration of atenolol and carbamazepine was studied under laboratory controlled conditions. Estimated bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were: 0.13 and 0.08 L kg(-1) upon exposure to 100 and 1000 mu g L-1 atenolol in water, respectively; while BCFs were 0.7 and 0.9 L kg(-1) when exposed to 10 and 100 mu g L-1 carbamazepine, respectively. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first report on pharmaceuticals in superficial waters of Argentina as well as the first report on the bioaccumulation of atenolol in whole body fish.

AB Purpose In this work, for the first time, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) based on maltose were fabricated as a new photocatalytic material to the photodegradation of imipramine (as a persistence organic pollutant) under light irradiation.
   Methods The synthesized GQDs were characterized by different instrumentation approaches such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A Box-Behnken design (BBD) and the response surface methodology (RSM) were applied for the optimization of different factors that affect the overall photocatalytic yield.
   Results Under the optimized conditions (pH of the sample solution: 2.0; photocatalyst dosage: 0.1 mg mL(-1); UV exposure time: 80 min), the highest achievable reduction efficiency was obtained about 80%. The stability and reusability of the synthesized photocatalytic material were investigated in four reaction cycles (80 min), which showed only a 15% photo-activity loss after the fourth photocatalytic runs.
   Conclusions The proposed method was successfully applied to degrade the mentioned drug in the real wastewater samples by about 70%. Regarding the mentioned advantages by the proposed method, this new kind of photocatalytic material possesses a strong potential for photodegradation of pollutants in industrial wastewater samples.

AB The co-generation of electricity and electrodialysis of seawater in a hybrid system is a promising approach to overcome water scarcity. Reverse electrodialysis harvests energy from the salinity gradient, where seawater is used as a high salinity stream while secondary treated wastewater can be used as a sustainable low salinity stream. Treated wastewater contains organic micropollutants, which can be transported to the seawater stream. The current research establishes a connection between adsorption and transport of organic micropollutants in ion exchange membranes, using a cross-flow stack in adsorption and zero-current experiments. To mimic the composition of treated wastewater, a mixture of nineteen organic micropollutants of varied physicochemical characteristics (e.g. size, charge, polarity, hydrogen donor/acceptor count, hydrophobicity) at environmentally relevant concentrations was used. Depending on the charge, micropollutants develop different types of mechanisms responsible for short-distance interactions with ion-exchange membranes, which has a direct influence in their transport behavior. This study provides a rational basis for the optimization/design of next-generation ion-exchange membranes, in which the permeability toward organic micropollutants should be also included. This investigation highly contributes to understanding the potential hazard posed by organic micropollutants in reverse electrodialysis in seawater desalination systems, where treated wastewater is used as a low salinity stream.

AB A large number of anthropogenic trace contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, their human metabolites and further transformation products (TPs) enter wastewater treatment plants on a daily basis. A mixture of known, expected, and unknown molecules are discharged into the receiving aquatic environment because only partial elimination occurs for many of these chemicals during physical, biological and chemical treatment processes. In this study, an array of LC MS methods from three collaborating laboratories was applied to detect and identify anthropogenic trace contaminants and their TPs in different waters. Starting with theoretical predictions of TPs, an efficient workflow using the combination of target, suspected-target and non-target strategies for the identification of these TPs in the environment was developed. These techniques and strategies were applied to study anti-hypertensive drugs from the sartan group (i.e., candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and valsartan). Degradation experiments were performed in lab-scale wastewater treatment plants, and a screening workflow including an inter-laboratory approach was used for the identification of transformation products in the effluent samples. Subsequently, newly identified compounds were successfully analyzed in effluents of real wastewater treatment plants and river waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Through systematic research a novel analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography magnetic sector mass spectrometry was developed for the measurement of 43 pharmaceuticals in wastewater. A thorough method validation quantified the contribution of both the extraction recovery and matrix effects in the overall method process efficiency, and a detailed uncertainty analysis was performed to elaborate a quality labelling strategy to be used in data interpretation. Compounds for which a precise (relative standard deviation <20%) process efficiency between 60% and 140% was determined, were labelled as 'quantitative' whereas the results for other compounds should be interpreted as 'indicative'.
   Method application on influent and effluent samples of (i) a conventional active sludge system and (ii) a parallel membrane bioreactor/conventional active sludge wastewater treatment plant in Belgium revealed the occurrence of 22 pharmaceuticals. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the antidepressant venlafaxine were measured in the effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 mu g L-1 and 0.2 to 0.5 mu g L-1, respectively, which indicated to be of high potential environmental risk for the receiving river Dender, Belgium.

AB The ability of several mesocosm-scale and full-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from urban wastewater was assessed. The results of three previous works were considered as a whole to find common patterns in PPCP removal. The experiment took place outdoors under winter and summer conditions. The mesocosm-scale CWs differed in some design parameters, namely the presence of plants, the vegetal species chosen (Typha angustifolia versus Phragmites australis), the flow configuration (surface flow versus subsurface flow), the primary treatment (sedimentation tank versus HUSB), the feeding regime (batch flow versus continuous saturation) and the presence of gravel bed. The full-scale CWs consisted of a combination of various subsystems (ponds, surface flow CWs and subsurface flow CWs). The studied PPCPs were ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, carbamazepine, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide. The performance of the evaluated treatment systems was compound dependent and varied as a function of the CW-configuration. In addition, PPCP removal efficiencies were lower during winter. The presence of plants favoured naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide removal. Significant positive correlations were observed between the removal of most PPCPs and temperature or redox potential. Accordingly, microbiological pathways appear to be the most likely degradation route for the target PPCPs in the CWs studied.

AB Global detection of antibiotic substances in water matrices has considerably increased in the recent past. However, in India research on this issue is limited or generalised in the literature. Risks associated with the presence of antibiotics in the environment can be quantified using a hazard quotient (HQ) approach. Here, HQs were developed using the measured environmental concentration (MEC) approach for antibiotic residues in Indian water matrices previously reported in the literature. In the present study, environmental risk assessment, using the HQ index [HQ= measured environmental concentration (MEC)/predicted no effect concentration (PNEC)] for different antibiotics, was performed according to the guidelines of European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA). MEC and PNEC levels were obtained from the literature. PNEC values were also calculated from EC50 using a safety factor when no PNECs were reported in the literature. HQs were obtained for industrial effluents (HQ= 104) that were greater than any previously reported values. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, seemed to present the greatest risk in India. The HQ indices for Indian water matrices were in the following order: industrial effluents> lake water> river water> hospital effluents> treated sewage. groundwater. A very high HQ represents a potential environmental concern for aquatic environments in India and demands that immediate attention be devoted to regulating these compounds, especially in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater.

AB Numerous studies have shown the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in different environmental compartments, for example, in surface water or wastewater ranging from nanograms per litre to micrograms per litre. Likewise, some recent studies have pointed to seasonal variability, thus indicating that PhAcs concentrations in the aquatic environment may depend on the time of year. This work intended to find out (1) whether Tagus fluvial and drinking water were polluted with different groups of PhACs and (2) if their concentrations differed between winter and summer seasons. From the 58 substances analysed, 41 were found belonging to the main therapeutic groups. Statistical differences were seen for antibacterials, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiepileptics, and cardiovascular drugs, with higher concentrations being detected in winter than in summer. These results might indicate that the PhACs analysed in this study undergo lower environmental degradation in winter than in summer. In order to confirm these initial results, a continuous monitoring should be performed especially on those PhACs that either because of an elevated consumption or an intrinsic chemical persistence are poorly degraded during winter months due to low temperatures and solar irradiation. It is especially important to identify which of these specific PhACs are in order to recommend their substitution by equally effective and safe substances but also environmentally friendly.

AB Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were calibrated in situ for selected illicit drugs and their metabolites at a sewage treatment works. Eleven out of 13 target compounds were detected and eight of those exhibited linear uptake kinetics with sampling rates between 0.035 and 0.150 L d(-1). Subsequently POCIS were deployed for 2 week periods over the course of a whole year, in order to examine trends in drug usage. Amphetamine and methamphetamine showed several similar peaks in concentration during the course of the year as did cocaine and two of its metabolites. Low levels of ecstasy were observed, with a prominent peak in May and a steady increase toward the end of the year. The antihistamine Cetirizine showed a clear increase in use during the summer months as expected and back calculation of the yearly dosage from POCIS accumulations yielded very similar results to that registered in the Norwegian prescription database. Estimations of cocaine usage using the parent compound averaged between 0.31 and 2.8 g d(-1) per 1000 inhabitants. POCIS is a cost-effective technique for the long-term monitoring of drug usage of a defined population and may overcome the difficulties of representative sampling associated with autosampling equipment.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCPs) in biosolids generated during municipal wastewater treatment (WWTP) was monitored weekly for 19 weeks. Biosolids samples obtained from a local WWTP were subjected to extraction with Soxhlet(R) apparatus for 24 hours. The extracts were concentrated and analyzed with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. There were 18 compounds representing a wide range of origins identified in biosolids including phthalate esters, ibuprofen and galaxolide. Phthalate esters were the most frequently detected compounds; and 4-nonyl phenol was the most concentrated chemical at 210 mg/kg-dry weight basis. The efficacy of the composting process to degrade the 10 of the PPCP compounds was also investigated with and without spiking biosolids. Biosolids were amended with straw, and composted for up to 45 days using a laboratory-scale composting system. The lowest degradation rate was observed for 50.11% for octyl-4-methoxy cinnamate (OM) and the highest was 99.73% for butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT). For all tested compounds except for unspiked OM, degradation efficiencies surpassed 85% at the end of the 45 days of composting study. The results of this study confirm the presence of various organic contaminants originated from personal care products in biosolids, and suggest that composting could be an effective treatment alternative for biosolids.

AB Anthropogenic chemicals in surface water and groundwater cause concern especially when the water is used in drinking water production. Due to their continuous release or spill-over at waste water treatment plants, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are constantly present in aquatic environment and despite their low concentrations, APIs can still cause effects on the organisms. In the present study, Chemcatcher passive sampling was applied in surface water, surface water intake site, and groundwater observation wells to estimate whether the selected APIs are able to end up in drinking water supply through an artificial groundwater recharge system. The API concentrations measured in conventional wastewater, surface water, and groundwater grab samples were assessed with the results obtained with passive samplers. Out of the 25 APIs studied with passive sampling, four were observed in groundwater and 21 in surface water. This suggests that many anthropogenic APIs released to waste water proceed downstream and can be detectable in groundwater recharge. Chemcatcher passive samplers have previously been used in monitoring several harmful chemicals in surface and wastewaters, but the path of chemicals to groundwater has not been studied. This study provides novel information on the suitability of the Chemcatcher passive samplers for detecting APIs in groundwater wells.

AB Emerging wastewater treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have attracted a significant amount of interest internationally due to their ability to produce high quality effluent suitable for water recycling. It is therefore important that their efficiency in removing hazardous trace organic contaminants be assessed. Accordingly, this study investigated the removal of trace organic chemical contaminants through a full-scale, package MBR in New South Wales, Australia. This study was unique in the context of MBR research because it characterised the removal of 48 trace organic chemical contaminants, which included steroidal hormones, xenoestrogens, pesticides, caffeine, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results showed that the removal of most trace organic chemical contaminants through the MBR was high (above 90%). However, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, omeprazole, sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim were only partially removed through the MBR with the removal efficiencies of 24-68%. These are potential indicators for assessing MBR performance as these chemicals are usually sensitive to changes in the treatment systems. The trace organic chemical contaminants detected in the MBR permeate were 1 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than guideline values reported in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. The outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of the levels and removal of trace organic contaminants by MBRs.

AB The surface flow constructed wetland (SF CW) in Can Cabanyes (Granollers, Catalonia, northeastern Spain) was created as a part of a series of activities aimed at restoring a highly impacted fluvial peri-urban zone. The system is fed with a small part of the secondary effluent, which is not completely nitrified, from an urban wastewater treatment plant. Effluents in the SF CW were sampled between 2003 and 2006 for physical and chemical parameters and faecal bacteria indicators. In addition, 8 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in June 2005 and February 2006. The system showed a good reliability for ammonium and faecal bacteria removal, with average ammonium efficiencies between 64 and 87% and a removal of approximately 2 logarithmic units of Faecal Coliforms. A clear seasonal trend was observed for ammonium. The results for PPCPs demonstrated that the wetland has a good capacity for removing a large variety of these compounds; the removal efficiencies were higher than 70% for most of them, with the exception of clofibric acid (34%) and carbamazepine (39%). Although the chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid removal rates were either low or zero because of the permanent eutrophic conditions of the system and the low incoming concentrations, the effluent quality is generally considered to be quite good.

AB Diclofenac (2-(2-(2, 6-dichlorophenylamino) phenyl) acetic acid, DCF) is an emerging pollutant under the sub-class of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). This study focused on the degradation of DCF with isolated microbial strains. The bacterial strains are considered a cost effective and eco-friendly approach for the degradation of such harmful compounds from the environment. Therefore, the experiments were started with isolation of the DCF degrading strains by the enrichment culture method. Finally, four bacterial strains;Enterococcus lactisstrain DSD-1 (MN744331),Bacillus paranthracisstrain DYD-1 (MN744332),Citrobacter portucalensisstrain PPD-2 (MN744333) andEnterococcus faeciumstrain DKD-1 (MN744334) were isolated from wastewater samples. These strains degrade DCF and use it as the sole carbon and energy source. Optimized physical parameters such as temperature (32.65 degrees C), pH (6.36), agitation speed (82.93 rpm), and DCF concentration (40.53 mg/L) were reported through Design Expert (R) software. The microbial consortium experiments suggested that equal volume of all the strains was very effective. This common microbial consortium degraded almost 90% of DCF in 20 days. This was due to the synergistic activities of the strains. We have reported five intermediate metabolites (DF-1, DF-2, DF-3, DF-4, and DF-5) through the GC-MS. These further used to predict the metabolic pathway of DCF degradation.

AB Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-induced coagulation of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) [PAH] was studied for the rapid removal of estrogens and phenolic compounds from water. When electrically equivalent amount (62 mg L-1) of SDS was added into the aqueous solution of 20 mg L-1 PAH with vigorous mixing, PAH was quantitatively (> 99%) recovered from water as condensed aggregates of PAH-SDS complexes. According to the fluorescence spectrum of a molecular probe, the complexes provided hydrophobic regions suitable for incorporating hydrophobic organic pollutants. However, rather polar estrone, beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethynylestradiol were insufficiently removed. Combined use of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the collection yields of these estrogens, because of their HRP-induced oxidation of and spontaneous binding to PAH. With the HRP activity of 100 U L-1 and the hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10 mg L-1, nearly complete (> 98%) removal of four estrogens was achieved within 10 mm at 30 degrees C in the pH region from 6 to 7.5. The method was also useful for the rapid removal of different phenolic compounds and selected pharmaceuticals. The applicability to wastewater treatment was successfully demonstrated by using secondary effluents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic compounds, like sulfamethoxazole (SMX), have become a concern in the aquatic environment due to the potential development of antibacterial resistances. Due to excretion and disposal, SMX has been frequently detected in wastewaters and surface waters. SMX removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) ranges from 0% to 90%, and there are opposing results regarding its biodegradability at lab scale. The objective of this research was to determine the ability of pure cultures of individual and mixed consortia of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Rhodococcus equi, Rhodococcus erythropolis, Rhodococcus rhodocrous, and Rhodococcus zopfii) known to exist in WWTP activated sludge to remove SMX. Results showed that R. equi alone had the greatest ability to remove SMX leading to 29% removal (with glucose) and the formation of a metabolite. Degradation pathways and metabolite structures have been proposed based on the potential enzymes produced by R. equi. When R. equi was mixed with other microorganisms, a positive synergistic effect was not observed and the maximum SMX removal achieved was 5%. This indicates that pure culture results cannot be extrapolated to mixed culture conditions, and the methodology developed here to study the biodegradability of compounds under controlled mixed culture conditions offers an alternative to conventional studies using pure bacterial cultures or inocula from activated sludge sources consisting of unknown and variable microbial populations.

AB Ampicillin is a widely used beta-lactam antibiotic that has been detected in various effluents and can alter biological processes used in wastewater treatment such as nitrification. Physiological and kinetic behaviour of a nitrifying consortium in the presence of ampicillin (AMP) (10, 25, and 50 mg/L) was evaluated in batch cultures. Under the experimental conditions (320 +/- 8 mg bacterial protein/L, C/N = 2.4, 24 h), the nitrifying behaviour was very similar among the controls without AMP and the assays with antibiotic, as there was no AMP effect on efficiency (ENH4+ = 99.7 +/- 4.2%), yields (Y-NO2(-) = 0, Y-NO3(-) = 1.0 +/- 0.1 mg N/mg NH4+-N consumed), neither specific rates of NH4+ oxidation and NO3- formation. Therefore, nitrifying bacteria were insensitive to AMP presence. At all assayed concentrations, after 24 h, 70.5 +/- 3.7% of AMP was removed from the cultures through abiotic (16.0-16.5%), biosorption (23.2-47.0%), and biotransformation (10.0-29.8%) processes. With the increase in the initial AMP concentration, a greater participation of the biotransformation process, associated to an increase in the specific AMP consumption rate was attained. The sludge was able to completely oxidize NH4+ to NO3- by nitrification and eliminate AMP biologically, but without reaching its full mineralization.

AB Four small freshwater river systems in Hessen, Germany, have been investigated with respect to seasonal and spatial concentration variations and transported load of the organophosphates tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) and the synthetic musk fragrances 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexa-methylcyclopenta-[gamma]-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (AHTN). Data originate from water samples collected in the time span from September 2003 to April 2005 at 25 sampling locations. The detection frequency for all compounds was about 90%. Mean concentration levels of organophosphates were 502 ng/L (TCPP), 276 ng/L (TBP), 183 ng/L (TBEP), 118 ng/L (TCEP), and 117 ng/L (TDCPP). The synthetic musk fragrances HHCB and ATHN were detected with mean concentrations of 141 and 46 ng/L, respectively. The variability of the concentration of all compounds was high with respect to space and time. The highest concentrations were observed in the Schwarzbach system characterized by the highest proportion of wastewater compared to the other river systems. Concentration levels of synthetic musk fragrances were significantly lower in summer times compared to winter times.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as template. It was then capable to recover this compound by 100 +/- 0.6% from a 2 mu g/L aqueous solution. By comparison, E2 recoveries of 77 +/- 5.2%, 87.1 +/- 2.3% and 19.1 +/- 7.8%, were achieved using a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) synthesized under the same conditions (but without template), a commercial C18 extraction phase and granular-activated carbon (GAC), respectively When fluoxetine hydrochloride and acenaphthene were added as interferences to the aqueous solution at 2 mu g/L each, E2 was recovered by 95.5 +/- 4.0% from the MIP, compared to 54.5 +/- 9.4%, 76.0 +/- 2% and 14.3 +/- 0.1% from the NIP, C18 and GAC phases, respectively Estrogenic activity equivalent to the effect caused by 22.4ng E2/L was recorded in the MIP extract from a wastewater sample whereas no activity was detected in the NIP extract. This suggested the imprinted polymers removed estrogenic compounds. This study therefore demonstrates the potential of MIPs for the selective removal of endocrine-disrupting compounds. By using a synthetic analogue to natural hormone receptors, adsorption is based on the same property that makes the contaminants harmful. Biological treatment of enriched E2 was also demonstrated.

AB The increasing load of pharmaceutical compounds has raised concerns about their potential residues in aquatic environments and ecotoxicity. Metformin (MET), a widely prescribed antidiabetic-II medicine, has been detected in high concentration in sewage and in wastewater treatment effluents. An uptake and translocation study was carried out to assess the ultimate fate of MET in phytoremediation. MET was removed from media by Typha latifolia, and the removal processes followed first order kinetics. After 28 days, the removal efficiencies were in a range of 74.0 +/- 4.1-81.1 +/- 3.3%. In roots, MET concentration was increasing during the first two weeks of the experiment but thereafter decreasing. In contrast, MET concentration was continuously increasing in rhizomes and leaves. Bioaccumulation of MET in roots was much higher than in leaves and rhizomes. As degradation product of metformin in the plant, methyl-biguanide (MBG) was detected whereas guanylurea was undetectable. Moreover, MBG concentration in roots was increasing with exposure time. An enzymatic degradation experiment showed the degradation rate followed the order of MET < MBG guanylurea. This may explain the low concentration of MBG in plant. The findings of this study contribute to understand and evaluate the potential for phytoremediation of such kind of contaminants.

AB This study aims to assess the removal of emerging contaminants from municipal wastewaters using a pilot system that integrated ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), and electrooxidation, which mineralized the RO concentrate. Initially, the study monitored 77 emerging contaminants in the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Most of the compounds were detected in significant amounts in the WWTP effluent.
   A group of 12 compounds that represent the most prevalent therapeutic pharmaceutical categories was selected to monitor their removal by UF/RO. For the majority of the micropollutants, the UF removal efficiency was less than 20%. Excellent removal efficiencies were achieved with the RO treatment. As a result, the concentrations of the emerging contaminants in the RO permeate varied between 44 ng/L for naproxen and 4 ng/L for ofloxacin, and furosemide, bezafibrate and fenofibric acid were not detected. After the RO treatment, electrooxidation of the RO concentrate with boron-doped diamond electrodes reduced the total micropollutant content in the RO concentrate from 149 mu g/L to less than 101 mu g/L. Increasing the intensity of the electrooxidation treatment is expected to further reduce the micropollutant concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed phase LC (RPLC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are widely used for the identification of suspects and unknown compounds in the environment. For the identification of unknowns, apart from mass accuracy and isotopic fitting, retention time (t(R)) and MS/MS spectra evaluation is required. In this context, a novel comprehensive workflow was developed to study the t(R) behavior of large groups of emerging contaminants using Quantitative Structure-Retention Relationships (QSRR). 682 compounds were analyzed by HILIC-HRMS in positive Electrospray Ionization mode (ESI). Moreover, an extensive dataset was built for RPLC-HRMS including 1830 and 308 compounds for positive and negative ESI, respectively. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was used to model the t(R) data. The applicability domains of the models were studied by Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) methods. The MCS method was also used to calculate the acceptable error windows for the predicted tR from various LC conditions. This paper provides validated models for predicting tR in HILIC/RPLC-HRMS platforms to facilitate identification of new emerging contaminants by suspect and non-target HRMS screening, and were applied for the identification of transformation products (TPs) of emerging contaminants and biocides in wastewater and sludge.

AB Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants in the aquatic environments. Their presence poses toxicological effects in humans and animals even at trace concentrations. This study investigated the presence of antibiotics, anti-epilepsy and anti-inflammatory drugs in river water of selected rivers in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for screening of sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones antibiotics. The samples were collected in upper-stream, middle-stream and lower-stream regions of the rivers and effluent of selected wastewater treatment plants. Pre-concentration of the samples was conducted using lyophilisation and extraction was conducted using solid phase extraction (SPE) on Waters Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced cartridge. The percentage recovery after sample clean-up on SPE was 103% +/- 6.9%. This was followed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The detected analytes were sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin and carbamazepine. Carbamazepine and erythromycin were detected in high concentrations ranging from 81.8 to 36,576.2 ng/L and 11.2 to 11,800 ng/L respectively, while clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole were detected at moderate concentrations ranging from 4.8 to 3280.4 ng/L and 6.6 to 6968 ng/L, respectively. High concentrations of pharmaceuticals were detected on the lower-stream sites as compared to upper-stream sites.

AB The increasingly ubiquitous release of emerging refractory pollutants into water is a serious concern due to associated risks. In this study, mesoporous hierarchical BiOBr/Fe3O4@SiO2-a solvothermally synthesized visible-light-driven magnetic photocatalyst-not only exhibited fast kinetics (t(1/2) = 8.7 min) in the photo catalytic degradation of ibuprofen in water but also achieved almost complete mineralization over a prolonged irradiation of 6 h. Various reactive species, including center dot O-2(-), center dot OH, and H2O2, were detected, while the scavenging experiments revealed that e(CB)(-)-mediated reactions and direct-hole oxidation are the major degradation routes. The magnetically recycled BiOBr/Fe(3)O4@SiO2 maintained similar to 80% of its initial photocatalytic activity even after five consecutive cycles. The typically copresent wastewater constituents, including NOM and anions, inhibited the photocatalytic performance to varying extents, and hence necessitated an increase in the photocatalyst dosage to achieve complete ibuprofen degradation in real sewage. Based on the findings of batch experiments, the process was scaled up by developing a 5 L prototype photocatalytic reactor integrated with an electromagnetic separation unit. The results of prototype photocatalytic experiments were comparable to those of batch experiments, and an electromagnetic separation efficiency of similar to 99% was achievable in 5 min.

AB The present study evaluates a battery of marine species-based bioassays against chemically characterized municipal wastewater samples (raw and WWTP treated). We estimated Dunaliella tertiolecta growth rate inhibition (24-96 h IC50 values), Artemia franciscano immobilization (24h LC50 values), mussel hemocytes viability and lipid peroxidation enhancement (in terms of neutral red retention assay/NRRT and malondialdehyde/MDA content, respectively) in influent- and WWTP effluent-treated species. We found algal growth arrest and stimulation respectively, almost similar 24hLC(50) values in Artemia sp., and significantly higher adverse effects (in terms of NRRT and MDA levels) in influent-treated mussel hemocytes. Furthermore, the estimation of hatchability, yolk-sac larvae mortality (24-120 hLC(50)) and spinal deformities (SD) in sea bream Sparus aurata showed slight variations over time, with the lowest LC50 and SD50 (representing spinal deformities at 50% of yolk-sac larvae) values to be observed in influent-treated larvae at 120 h. Data interpretation (both chemical and biological) revealed that toxic endpoints, such as NRRT50, 96hIC(50)Dun, 120hLC(50)Sparus and 120hSD(50)Sparus, significantly related to WWTP removal efficiency and further mediated by the presence of dominant compounds, such as As and Cr, could be used for identifying main components of toxicity in wastewaters.

AB Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been widely investigated as promising technologies to remove trace organic contaminants from water, but have rarely been used for the treatment of real waste streams. Anodic oxidation with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode was applied for the treatment of secondary effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant containing 29 target pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed from the contaminants decay, dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand removal. The effect of applied current and pH was evaluated. Almost complete mineralization of effluent organic matter and trace contaminants can be obtained by this EAOP primarily due to the action of hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface. The oxidation of Cl- ions present in the wastewater at the BDD anode gave rise to active chlorine species (Cl-2/HClO/ClO-), which are competitive oxidizing agents yielding chloramines and organohalogen byproducts, quantified as adsorbable organic halogen. However, further anodic oxidation of HClO/ClO- species led to the production of ClO3- and ClO4- ions. The formation of these species hampers the application as a single-stage tertiary treatment, but posterior cathodic reduction of chlorate and perchlorate species may reduce the risks associated to their presence in the environment.

AB Effluents from wastewater treatment plants and untreated sewage constitute a low concentration but continuous source of pharmaceutical products to the aquatic environment. One such drug, ibuprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that primarily acts through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka) were exposed for 6 weeks via water to three concentrations of ibuprofen (1-100 mu g/L nominal concentrations) and a water control. Reproductive parameters, including frequency of spawning, fecundity, egg size, and rate of fertilization, were measured for each pair of adult medaka following 6 weeks of exposure. Livers homogenates from exposed individuals were assayed for COX activity and whole individuals were histologically examined for tissue damage. Increasing exposure to ibuprofen significantly increased the number of eggs per reproductive event, but decreased the number of spawning events per week. Liver tissue collected from females had less variability in COX activity with increasing concentration of ibuprofen exposure, and tended to have elevated hepatosomatic indices. No pathological damage was evident the in the gills, livers and head kidneys of animals from the highest exposure group. The results of this experiment begin to show that exposure to chronic low levels of ibuprofen alter the pattern of reproduction and may produce sex-specific responses in teleosts.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern present in domestic waste streams include a highly diverse group of potentially biologically active compounds that can be detected at trace levels in wastewater. Concerns about potential uptake into crops arise when reclaimed water is used in food crop production. The present study investigated how 9 contaminants of emerging concern in reclaimed water are taken up into edible portions of two food crops. Two flame retardant chemicals, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and several polar pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) accumulated in a linear, concentration-dependent manner in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) irrigated with reclaimed water, suggesting passive uptake of both neutral and ionizable chemical contaminants in lettuce. Furthermore, concentration-dependent accumulation of TCEP and TCPP from reclaimed water was also observed in strawberry fruits (Fragaria ananassa). Collectively, these data suggest that highly polar or charged contaminants can be taken up by crops from water bearing contaminants of emerging concern and can be accumulated in the edible portions. Using these data, however, estimates of human exposure to these contaminants from reclaimed water food crop accumulation suggest that exposure to the contaminants of emerging concern examined in the present study is likely substantially lower than current exposure guidelines.

AB The growing consumption of pharmaceuticals together with their incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) implies the occurrence of these compounds in natural water resources. To investigate the natural attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals (caffeine, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, naproxen and carbamazepine) during vadose zone infiltration, unsaturated column (L 26.67 cm, empty set 7.62 cm) experiments, filled with a sandy -loamy soil, were performed using two input concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g L-1). The software Hydrus 1D was used to simulate experimental data. Caffeine and acetaminophen were never detected at the column outlet indicating a low environmental concern. On the other hand, attenuation of the detected pharmaceuticals could be reproduced by a combination of retardation and removal approaches. Carbamazepine is among the selected contaminants the most persistent. A dependence of removal rates on input concentrations was detected for sulfamethoxazole (mu(w) from 2.78 d(-1) to 1.16 d(-1)) and naproxen (mu(w) from 1.16 d (-1) to 0.63 d(-1)) attributed mainly to decreased metabolism of microorganisms when a higher input concentration is applied. Two transformation products (TPs) (N4-Acetylsulfamethoxazole and epoxycarbamazepine) derived from sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine transformation, respectively, were detected during the experiment with the highest input concentration.

AB The effect of seasonal changes, ionic strength, effluent dilution, transmembrane pressure and spiked concentration on the rejection of the pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), carbamazepine (CBZ) and diatrizoate (DTZ) by reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF), was studied. They represent two families of compounds owning low/medium hydrophobicity and relatively high stability to biological transformation at wastewater treatment plant conditions, frequently present in effluents. Experiments were performed with membrane bioreactor effluents and ultrapure water (UPW) to test the influence of background matrix on the rejection. Three RO (BW. SW and XLE) and two NF (NF90 and NF270) membranes were tested. RO exhibited high rejection of both the compounds (> 98%) regardless of membrane resolution or conditions tested. The loosest membrane tested, NF270, displayed a marked seasonal influence on CBZ rejection from effluents (up to 92% in summer and down to 50% in winter), whereas its rejection from UPW was steady (74 +/- 7%). These findings strongly suggest that interactions between low/medium hydrophobicity-PhACs and effluent organic matter (EfOM) took place which markedly changed rejection efficiencies. These interactions seem to be highly correlated to EfOM quality, being enhanced during summer, increasing the removal of small PhACs even by loose nonporous membranes, but decreasing during winter, thus reducing rejection.

AB Lab-scale batch experiments with biosolids collected from a full-scale activated sludge system (AS) and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of elimination of 5 acidic pharmaceuticals and 2 neutral pharmaceuticals. Batch elimination experiments were conducted under the conditions of pH of 6 and 7, and a great impact of pH on elimination of pharmaceuticals was shown by the significant differences in elimination rates under different pH conditions: elimination of pharmaceuticals was enhanced under the condition of lower pH regardless of the type of biosolid. Degree of mineralization of ibuprofen was also investigated in this study by using (14)C-labeled compounds. Although ibuprofen has been considered to be a readily biodegradable pharmaceutical in previous studies, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the degree of mineralization of ibuprofen would be limited in biological wastewater treatment including MBRs. The results obtained in this study imply that a large portion of pharmaceuticals that have been considered "biodegradable", such as ibuprofen, entering into wastewater treatment plants will eventually be discharged into natural water bodies as intermediates, although concentrations of them may look reduced on the basis of common analytical methods (i.e. GC/MS or LC/MS/MS).

AB Biobed bioremediation systems (BBSs) arewidely used to prevent point-source pesticide contamination of water. However, these systems have never been investigated for possible elimination of emerging contaminants (ECs). In this study, two biobed systems, involving biomixtures elaborated with soil and raw olive mill cake (SCP) or its vermicompost (SVP), were assayed to determine their effectiveness in removing the ECs diclofenac, ibuprofen and triclosan from effluent wastewater. Adsorption, incubation and bioaccesibility experiments were carried out. The SCP and SVP biomixtures showed greater adsorption capacity than the soil (S), used as reference. In SVP and S, the degradation rates of the ECs applied were similar and over 94% of these compounds was removed after 84 days of incubation. However, SCP biomixture had a lower removal rate and the percentage of ECs removed ranged from 32 to 68%. In SVP, the bioaccesible fraction (E) reveals that approximately 82% of triclosan and diclofenac adsorption occurred in bioaccesible sites, thus explaining the more efficient decontamination observed in this biomixture. The relationship established between the bioaccesible and biodegradable fractions suggests that E values are a useful tool for predicting the endpoints of ECs biodegradation in bioremediation systems. UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis of samples showed different metabolite products. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A monitoring programme was carried out in order to determine iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) in the River Danube and to investigate the raw water quality for drinking water production at Langenau waterworks. The study revealed that the maximum concentrations of ICM (over 500 ng l(-1) for diatrizoic acid and iopamidol) were found in 2 h-composite samples taken from the downstream of the Ulm/Neu-Ulm metropolitan area. By means of a concentration profile over one month the highest ICM concentrations were observed on weekdays. The extended data evaluation with principal component analysis shows that the upstream and downstream samples had different pattern of variations in ICM concentration and also demonstrates a clear change in ICM composition by the discharge of municipal wastewater. In addition to load profiles of ICM, time-dependent plots of principal component I exhibited peaks, indicating a short-term discharge of ICM between the two sampling sites. In conclusion, a point source for ICM contamination between the sampling sites in Ulm upstream and Leipheim downstream seems to be the reasonable explanation for peak ICM concentrations. Due to the observed high variations of ICM concentrations in river, the evaluation of natural waters by means of a single analysis is not representative. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In-sewer stability of human excreted biomarkers is a critical factor of wastewater-based epidemiology in back-estimating illicit drug and pharmaceutical use in the community. Biomarker stability has been investigated in sewers with the presence of biofilms, but the understanding in sewer sediments is still lacking. This study for the first time employed a laboratory sediment reactor to measure 18 illicit drug and pharmaceutical biomarkers under gravity sewer environments with the presence of sediments. Biomarkers exhibited various stability patterns due to transformation processes occurring in the bulk wastewater and sediments. The attenuation of a biomarker by sediments is driven by complex processes involving biodegradation, diffusion, and sorption, which is directly proportional to the ratio of sediment surface area against wastewater volume. The sediment-driven transformation coefficients of biomarkers are higher than the accordingly biofilm-mediated rates because of stronger microbial activities in sediments. Additionally, the stability of most biomarkers was insensitive to the natural pH variation in sewers, except for a few compounds (e.g., methadone, ketamine, and paracetamol) susceptible to pH changes. In general, this study delineates the stability data of various biomarkers in gravity sewers with sediments, which are novel and long-missing information for wastewater-based epidemiology and improve the reliability of back-estimation in complex sewer networks.

AB The presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants (including stimulants and antibiotics) from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue. The problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle. The removal of these contaminants, so that the water may be reused, is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment. Within this context, the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, amoxicillin, and penicillin G). The chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes, which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Medina Sidonia (SW Spain), carrying out sampling in the feed, reject and permeate streams over a period of 72 h. DOW-FILMTEC BW30-2540 membranes were used for this purpose, operating at a pressure of 15 bar. The emerging contaminants were analysed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The applied treatments allowed a contaminant-free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse. This technique achieved 100% removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72 h test.

AB The concentration and recovery of the high-added value phenolic fraction from two-phase olive mill wastewater and the simultaneous effluent treatment by a novel micro/ultra/nanocentrifugation membrane process assessment is addressed, permitting to gather information for a correct and effective screening procedure for the adequate membrane election (MF-UF-loose NF) for the target. Phenolic compounds are the major factor of phytotoxicity of these effluents, but on the other hand they present high antioxidant properties that makes them very relevant for food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. The selection of a membrane MWCO between 100 kDa and 0.45 mu m permitted the complete transfer of the phenolic fraction to the permeate, whereas below 3 kDa they would be transferred to the concentrate stream instead, with similar to 60% COD reduction and EC lowered to 551-662 mu S cm(-1) in the final treated stream ensured, sensibly improving the effluent quality. This would provide a purified effluent with good salinity standards according to the indications given by the FAO for irrigation reuse. This procedure could be quick and reliable for the assessment of the adequate membrane needed for a particular purification process, in contrast with long-term, time consuming common bench-scale procedures.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) contain a large number of chemical pollutants such as disinfectants, surfactants, and pharmaceutical residues. A part of these pollutants is not eliminated by traditional urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), leading to a risk for the aquatic ecosystems receiving these effluents. In order to assess this risk, we formulated a specific methodology based on the ecotoxicological characterisation of the hospital wastewater using a battery of three chronic bioassays (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Heterocypris incongruens and Brachionus calyciflorus). We used it for the posteriori risk assessment of a hospital recently built in south-east France, and we studied the evolution of this risk during two years. We also used it to assess the decrease of the ecotoxicological risk after treatment of the effluent in a specific line of the local WWTP. Lastly, we compared these results with the risk assessment made before the building of the hospital in the context of a priori risk assessment. The results obtained showed an important evolution of the risk overtime, according to the hospital activities and the river flows, and a real decrease of the risk after treatment in the dedicated line. They also showed that the a priori assessment of ecotoxicological risks, made previously, was overstated, mainly because of the application of the precautionary principle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The contamination of freshwater systems arises in many river basins due to industrialization and population growth, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Despite these concerns, the fate and potential impact of many emerging pollutants are currently unknown, especially when the compounds are released into surface waters from populations distributed across large spatial scales. In order to address this shortcoming, a spatially-explicit contaminant fate model was developed as an extension of the global, vector-based river routing model HydroROUT. HydroROUT operates at very high spatial resolution (similar to 500 m), simulates river and stream chemical transport with in-stream removal, and contains links to a set of lakes and reservoirs, which act as a partial sink during the transport. The chemical fate model was applied to China and includes a consumption and release module based on county-level population demographics, considers point-source contributions from 2547 wastewater treatment plants, and accumulates contributions of rural and urban populations not connected to sewage treatment plants. As a case study, the sources and fates of the estrogens estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3), as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were modelled in Chinese surface water bodies. Preliminary validation of the results showed predictions to be within the ranges of concentrations reported in literature, with exception of EE2. The total estrogenic mass in the entire river and lake system amounted to 370 tonnes of estrogens, with about 1.3 tonnes per year discharged to the ocean, neighboring countries or to inland sinks. Under a selected baseline scenario, eco-toxicological risk - i.e., contaminant concentrations in excess of the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) - is found in 23.6% of all analyzed rivers of China with an average flow > 0.1 m(3)/s. Out of these, about 4% of rivers showed a high level of risk of 10 times or more above PNEC. Medium-to-large rivers are disproportionally affected; for example, 23.6%, 37.3%, 29.0% and 21.6% of river length are at risk in rivers of 1-10, 10-100, 100-1,000, and 1,000-10,000 m(3)/s of discharge, respectively, whereas no risk was predicted in the largest rivers (i.e., >10,000 m(3)/s) of China. Wastewater treatment plants process 22.5% of the total hormone load and thus play an important role in water quality control by reducing the risk in substantial portions of the river network, which would otherwise show elevated risk. Releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewaters from fossil fuel refining, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides are the main sources of phenolic compounds. Those with more complex structures are often more toxic than the simple phenol, and yet little is known about the treatment of wastewater containing a mixture of phenolic pollutants.. The present study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of UASB and SBR for the treatment of mixtures of phenolics compounds.
   The experiments were conducted in a laboratory scale UASB reactor, which had a volume of 1.414 I. A gas-liquid solid separator, GLSS was provided at the top of the reactor. The reactor was operated at constant HRT of 24 h throughout the study. The reactor was seeded with digested sewage sludge obtained from Okhla Sewage Treatment Plant, New Delhi, India. Initially the microbial culture was acclimatized to phenol concentration of 600 mg l(-1) in UASB. Thereafter, different phenol: m-cresols ratio were introduced, 10:1, 4.5:1, 2.7:1, 1.75:1 and 1.2:1 and the performance of the reactor was evaluated under each case. The second experiment was conducted in a laboratory scale SBR reactor with a working volume of 1.4 I. The effluent was drawn from a volumetric exchange ratio of 50%. A fine bubble aerator in the bottom of the column was used to introduce air. The reactor was seeded with aerobic digested sludge obtained from Star Paper Mill, Saharanpur, UP, India. A constant HRT of 12h was kept throughout the study. Reactor was operated sequentially with fill, react, settle and draw periods for a cycle of 6h. In order to establish a viable biomass and minimize any potential toxic effects due to presence of phenolic compounds, the sludge was fed with phenol as batch culture up to 1000 mg l(-1) concentration. After acclimatization, different phenol: m cresol ratio were introduced 6.5:1, 2:1, 1.1:1, 0.5:1 and the performance of the reactor was evaluated under each case. A start up period of 40 days was required to acclimatize the anaerobic bacterial at HRT of 24 hrs for phenol concentration of 200 mg l(-1). UASB reactor successfully biodegraded phenol and m-cresol up to a maximum ratio (1.25:1) (300: 250 mg l(-1)) with 80% efficiency. A start up period of 30 days was required to acclimatize aerobic bacteria with phenol to concentration up to 1000 mg l(-1) as batch culture. The maximum phenol and m-cresol up to (1.1: 1) (800: 700 mg l(-1)) was successfully treated with efficiency of 95% in SBR. The results indicates that anaerobic treatment by UASB and aerobic treatment by SBR can be successfully used for phenol/cresol mixture, representative of major substrates in chemical and petrochemical wastewater and the results shows proper acclimatization period is essential for the degradation of m - cresol and phenol. Moreover, SBR was found as a better alternative than UASB reactor as it is more efficient and higher concentration of m cresols can be successfully degraded.

AB We investigated the concentrations of 57 target compounds in the different treatment units of various biological treatment processes in South Korea, including modified biological nutrient removal (BNR), anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O), and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems, to elucidate the occurrence and removal fates of PPCPs in WWTPs. Biological treatment processes appeared to be most effective in eliminating most PPCPs, whereas some PPCPs were additionally removed by post-treatment. With the exception of the MBR process, the A2O system was effective for PPCPs removal. As a result, removal mechanisms were evaluated by calculating the mass balances in A2O and a lab-scale MBR process. The comparative study demonstrated that biodegradation was largely responsible for the improved removal performance found in lab-scale MBR (e.g., in removing bezafibrate, ketoprofen, and atenolol). Triclocarban, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and tetracycline were adsorbed in large amounts to MBR sludge. Increased biodegradability was also observed in lab-scale MBR, despite the highly adsorbable characteristics. The enhanced biodegradation potential seen in the MBR process thus likely plays a key role in eliminating highly adsorbable compounds as well as non-degradable or persistent PPCPs in other biological treatment processes.

AB Metformin is the most commonly used anti-diabetic drug in the world. When consumed, this unmetabolised pharmaceutical compound is excreted by the body and eventually enters the environment through a variety of pathways. Based on its high consumption and excretion rates, high concentrations of metformin have been detected in influents of wastewater treatment plants. Metformin and its transformation product, guanylurea, are also expected to be present in other aquatic environments based on their physico-chemical properties. Not surprisingly, guanylurea has also been detected in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. Available information on ecotoxicological effects of metformin suggests that metformin is a potential endocrine disruptor and thus further emphasising the threat this drug could pose to our environment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metformin and critically discusses available literature data with respect to its global use/demand, occurrence, fate and ecotoxicity in treatment facilities equipped with conventional and advanced treatment technologies, and its degradation/removal mechanisms. Final section highlights the existing knowledge gaps regarding its ultimate fate under the natural and engineered ecosystems and identifies some important research areas requiring urgent attention from regulatory makers and scientific community.

AB In this study, the concentrations of 15 pharmaceuticals were monitored during four seasons (February, May, July, and November 2010) along a 32 km stretch of a highly wastewater polluted watercourse (River Rakkolanjoki, Lake Haapajarvi) in Eastern Finland. The aim was to study the seasonal variation in the elimination of the pharmaceuticals and the stability of the compounds along the watercourse. The analysis was carried out using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method combined with extraction and preconcentration on HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Pharmaceutical concentrations were determined at 9 points along the watercourse, and loads and removal of parent compounds were calculated using flow data from the discharge point and the last sampling point. The pharmaceuticals were found in concentrations ranging from low ng l(-1) to low mg l(-1) values at the discharge point and at concentrations of 0-556 ng l(-1) at the last sampling point. The rate of elimination of the pharmaceutical load was significantly higher in May and July than in February and November. There were clear differences in the stability of the individual compounds along the watercourse. Carbamazepine was not eliminated during any season, while ibuprofen, ketoprofen and sertraline were fully eliminated over the studied stretch of river during the summer months. Other compounds showed continuous elimination independent of the season, indicating different elimination paths, such as sorption, biodegradation and phototransformation, for the studied compounds.

AB Activated carbon (AC) and activated biochar (ABC) are widely used as sorbents for micropollutant removal during water and wastewater treatment. Spent adsorbents can be treated in several ways, e.g., by incineration, disposal in landfills, or reactivation. Regeneration is an attractive and potentially more economically viable alternative to modern post-treatment practices. Current strategies for assessing the performance of regeneration techniques often involve only repeated adsorption and regeneration cycles, and rarely involve direct measurements of micropollutants remaining on the adsorbent after regeneration. However, the use of regenerated adsorbents containing such residual micropollutants could present an environmental risk. In this study, the extraction of eight active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) commonly found in treated effluents was evaluated using 10 solvents and sorption onto three different carbon materials. An optimized extraction method was developed involving ultrasonication in 1:1 methanol:dichloromethane with 5% formic acid. This method achieved recoveries of 60 to 99% per API for an API concentration of 2 mu g/g char and 27 to 129% per API for an API concentration of 1 mg/g char. Experiments using a mixture of 82 common APIs revealed that the optimized protocol achieved extraction recoveries above 70% for 29 of these APIs. These results show that the new extraction method could be a useful tool for assessing the regenerative properties of different carbon sorbents.

AB The bioaccumulation of a broad range of pharmaceuticals and personal care product chemicals (PPCPs) was studied in Cootes Paradise Marsh (CPM), an urban wetland that receives tertiary treated municipal waste waters as well as urban storm runoff. We measured PPCPs in caged and wild goldfish, as well as wild carp, and compared observed bioaccumulation factors (BAF(P)) using concentrations in surface waters and fish blood plasma, with modeled BAFs. Thirty-two PPCPs were detected in water from the central CPM site (CPM3) while 64 PPCPs were found at higher concentrations at a site immediately downstream of the effluent outflow (CPM1). Following a 3-week deployment, 15 PPCPs were detected in the plasma of caged goldfish at CPM1, and 14 at CPM3, compared to only 3 in goldfish caged at a reference site. The highest BAF(P) in goldfish were for the antidepressant Sigma fluoxetine averaging 386 L/kg in caged and 906 L/kg in wild goldfish, respectively. In carp, Sigma Diazepam (diazepam and oxazepam) had the highest BAF(P) (927 L/kg). This study identified a broader range of PPCPs in fish and surface waters than previously reported. However, modeled BAFs did not show good agreement with observed whole body or plasma BAFs, demonstrating that more work is needed to better explain bioaccumulation of PPCPs.

AB An experimental study combining biological treatment with flocculation (F) and ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology was conducted, separately and in combination, seeking to increase insight into the capability of such treatment processes to remove emerging contaminants (ECs). The occurrence and removal efficiencies of 17 ECs are reported for wastewater from Mexico City. Results showed that activated sludge (AS) is the predominant process for removing acidic pharmaceutical compounds, and the use of a cationic flocculant increases the biodegradability of these compounds as well as that of 4-nonylphenol. The UF process alone showed greater removal of phenolic compounds than AS. However, the contribution of flocculation to EC removal by the UF unit was fairly limited. In general, the F + AS + UF processes yielded better results than their separate use, leading to the highest removal rates of 15 of the 17 compounds. In the case of some phenolic compounds and the phthalic acid esters, a competitive sorption process between the membrane and the sludge steps seemed to take place. Bis-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) was found to be significantly sorbed onto sludge. The F + AS + UF process operated as amembrane bioreactor (MBR) using 16 gL(-1) of suspended solids in the mixed liquor (MLSS) yielded the highest removal efficiencies for the ECs tested.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of corticosteroid signaling disruptors in wastewaters and rivers in the Czech Republic and in Switzerland. 36 target compounds were detected using HPLC-MS/MS, with up to 6.4 mu g/L for azole antifungals that indirectly affect corticosteroid signaling. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated activity was determined using the GR-CALUX bioassay with dexamethasone equivalent concentrations ranging from <LOD-2.6, 19-37, and 78-542 ng/L for river water, treated, and untreated wastewater, respectively. For most samples, the chemically predicted GR-mediated response was higher than that determined by the bioassay. Correspondingly, antiglucocorticoid activity was observed in some fractions. The fish plasma model (FPM), which predicts plasma concentrations, was applied to evaluate the potential of detected pharmaceuticals to cause receptor-mediated effects in fish. With one exception, medroxyprogesterone, the FPM applied to individual compounds predicted fish plasma concentrations to be below the level of human therapeutic plasma concentrations. To account for the activity of the sum of GR-active compounds, we introduce the "cortisol equivalents fish plasma concentration" approach, through which an increase in fish glucocorticoid plasma levels comparable to 0.9-83 ng/mL cortisol after exposure to the analyzed river waters was estimated. The results suggest that these chemicals may impact wild fish.

AB In this study, a pretreatment method based on the QuEChERS method has been applied for simultaneously extracting 27 residual pharmaceuticals from wastewater solids. The extracted compounds have been analyzed using online solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A recovery test was conducted according to the absorbent type, and buffers were added in the sample extraction step. The highest recovery efficiency could be observed when Na2SO4 was used as an absorbent and Na(2)EDTA was injected during the extraction process; the recovery efficiencies of the proposed method for the target compounds ranged from 61.3 to 137.2%, and the repeatability was 6.8%. These recovery and repeatability data showed that the proposed method could reliably analyze the 27 target residual pharmaceuticals. The concentrations of the target compounds were all below the limits of quantification: 830 ng g(-1) for the target compounds in suspended solids, 2353 ng g(-1) in activated sludge, and 1929 ng g(-1) in waste sludge. The analytical method established in this study can be applied to quantify residual pharmaceuticals in solid samples and to investigate their behaviors in a municipal wastewater treatment plant.

AB Boron nitride (BN) nanosheets are promising support materials for catalysts. A series of TiO2-BN enabled electrospun nanofibers were synthesized for the photocatalytic treatment of ibuprofen and secondary wastewater effluent under visible light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the existence of B-O-Ti bonds between the BN nanosheets and TiO2 nanofibers, resulting in energy rearrangement, narrowed band gaps, and enhanced light utilization efficiency of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites in the visible light spectrum. Transient photocurrent measurements revealed that the BN enhanced the transport of photogenerated holes from the bulk TiO2 nanofibers to its surface, resulting in more efficient separation and less recombination of the charge carriers. A kinetic study of ibuprofen degradation indicated the enhanced photocatalytic performance of TiO2-BN catalysts with a higher BN content in the nanocomposites. The kinetic rate constant of the TiO2-10% BN catalysts was 10 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanofibers. The degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater followed the same trend as ibuprofen and improved with increasing BN content. The stability of the TiO2-BN nanocomposites as an effective solar photocatalyst was demonstrated by multiple cycles of wastewater treatment. The results proved that TiO2-BN is an appealing photocatalyst under visible light.

AB Due to its key role in the contamination of natural resources, the assessment of raw and treated wastewater effluents is a current major concern and urges comprehensive analytical methods capable of selectively capturing the chemodiversity of these samples. In this context, the overall objective of this work can be summarized as (i) the assessment of the performance of secondary and tertiary (advanced oxidation) wastewater treatments through multivariate analysis followed by (ii) the comprehensive characterization of wastewater samples based on their spectral fingerprints and a combination of suspect and non-target screening approaches. Several compounds, belonging to different sources of contamination were annotated and/or partially identified: pharmaceuticals, metabolites and transformation compounds, human activity markers, surfactants, and polyethoxy compounds. These results highlight the contribution of filtering and screening tools such as monoisotopic exact mass, mass defect, MS/MS data-dependent acquisitions, isotopic pattern and retention time to the selection, and the identification of environmental contaminants and their metabolites/degradation products. This paper completes the target study conducted in the SIPIBEL site and offers an alternative for the assessment of treatment processes by broadening the spectrum to a larger number of compounds and the correlations between them.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater is difficult to be treated efficiently by the conventional biological wastewater treatment plant and reverse osmosis is a solution for this kind of wastewater pollution control. One limitation for RO application in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is the treatment of RO concentrate. This work prepared a Co doped PbO2 anode and assessed the treatment of reverse osmosis concentrates with electrochemical oxidation process using this Co doped PbO2 anode. The operational parameters which have an influence on the electrochemical oxidation of quinoline, including the current density, the initial concentration of quinoline and the initial value of pH, were studied. The results revealed that the electrochemical degradation of quinoline followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics and the optimal removals of quinoline and COD were 100% and 59.35% after 120 min. The EE/O was calculated among all the experiments which showed that the Co doped electrode would greatly reduce the EE/O value. The degradation mechanism and kinetics were analyzed and the intermediates including kinds of organic acids generated during the process of electrolysis were analyzed. This paper can provide a technique reference for the reverse osmosis concentrate pollution control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The competitive adsorption characteristics of four pharmaceutical compounds, including clofibric acid (CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), naproxen (NAP), and diclofenac (DCF), were evaluated on granular activated carbon in secondary effluent. In ultrapure water (UW), the adsorption efficiencies of CA, CBZ, NAP, and DCF on coconut shell-based carbon were 63.0, 85.5, 79.1, and 68.8%, respectively, at initial concentration of 500g/L and carbon dosage of 133mg/L. All the substrates could be removed completely when carbon dosage was increased to 250mg/L. In the secondary effluent from a real wastewater treatment plant, the removal of four pharmaceuticals were decreased to 26.9, 57.9, 44.7, and 31.0%, respectively, with carbon dosage of 250mg/L, which recovered to 39.6, 67.1, 53.4, and 48.1% after solution filtration by 0.22-m hydrophilic membrane. The suspended solids and soluble organic compounds in wastewater were considered as the key inhibited factors for pharmaceuticals adsorption by activated carbon. The differences of adsorption efficiency between spiked UW and secondary effluent demonstrate that further purification for secondary effluent is necessary in practical wastewater treatment, when activated carbon is used as adsorbent for pharmaceuticals removal and wastewater advanced treatment.

AB The influence of ultrasound cavitation in the atmosphere of different gases, namely oxygen, air, and nitrogen, on the destruction of impurities of butanol and ethanol found in wastewater from the pharmaceutical plant "Galichpharm" was investigated. The effect of the corresponding gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and air) without ultrasound cavitation on the destruction of ethanol and butanol impurities in wastewater was comparatively investigated. The degree of oxidation of organic matter, effective rate constants, and approximation coefficients were calculated. It was found that the air supply is the least effective for both ethanol and butanol impurities. Degradation of ethanol by air contributed to the reduction in the organic matter content by 14.6 %, while oxidation of butanol was not observed. Ultrasound cavitation enhanced the effect of air and in common action with air the ethanol impurity content reduced by 32.58 %, and butanol impurity by 4.05 %. Nitrogen bubbling produced mediocre results for the destruction of ethanol and butanol impurities giving a decrease by 17.04 % and 0.67 %, respectively. The highest results were obtained with oxygen. Ethanol impurities decreased by 22.47 % and butanol impurities by 1.75 %. With the common action of oxygen and ultrasound, much higher results were obtained, 44.32 % for ethanol impurities and 7.43 % for butanol impurities.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) upgrades can reduce both nutrient and micropollutant emissions into receiving rivers, thus modifying the composition and function of biological communities. However, how microbial communities vary and whether they can be restored to levels found in less-polluted rivers remains uncertain. Aquatic biofilms are sensitive to environmental change and respond rapidly to bottom-up pressure. Thus, we used 12 flumes configured in three experimental treatments to mimic the dynamic processes of biofilm microbial communities occurring in a wastewater-receiving river following WWTP upgrade, with rivers containing two levels of nutrients and micropollutants used as references. We compared the biofilm microbial biomass, carbon source utilization, and community composition among the three "blocks". Results showed that the metabolic patterns of the carbon sources and composition of the biofilm bacterial communities in the flumes mimicking a receiving river with WWTP upgrade recovered over time to those mimicking a less-disturbed river. The restoration of potential carboxylic acid-consuming denitrifying bacteria (i.e., Zoogloea, Comamonas, Dechloromonas, and Acinetobacter) likely played a significant role in this process. Combining quantitative analysis of the denitrification genes nirS and nosZ, we confirmed that the denitrification function of the river biofilms recovered after WWTP upgrade, consistent with our previous field investigation.

AB Several series of batch and continuous experiments were performed to investigate the removal of metformin and other contaminants from two wastewaters: wastewater I (WWI) containing 4 mg/L metformin and wastewater II (WWII) containing 110 g/L butanol. Biomethane potential (BMP) tests on WWII showed 77% of total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD = 110 g/L) degradability, and no apparent inhibition effects were observed. BMP tests on WWI showed an apparent inhibitory effect reflected in lower biogas production with increasing metformin concentration in the wastewater. Continuous flow hybrid vertical anaerobic biofilm (HyVAB (R)) experiments were consistent with the batch test findings. It was necessary to co-digest WWI (metformin) with WWII (easily degradable organics) to achieve complete metformin removal. After a period of adaptation, WWI and WWII co-digestion achieved up to 98% tCOD removal and 100% metformin removal. Most of the contaminants were removed in the anaerobic section of the HyVAB (R), which implies that higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) loads than tested here are possible, given some optimization. The pilot reactor was able to manage organic loads of 11 g COD/d and above 10 mg/L metformin with a removal of 98% and 100% for tCOD and metformin, respectively.

AB Performance of moving bed biofilm reactor system for a real hospital wastewater (HW) was experimented, modelled, and optimized using response surface methodology. Prior to conducting laboratory tests, design of the experiments was evaluated to minimize any prediction error. Statistical analyses demonstrated the models' validity and adequacy for anticipation of the removal of BOD and COD by the process. The models predictions (with desirability of 0.98) were found to be in very good agreement with confirmative experiments results. The results indicated that under convenient operating conditions of the studied variables (packing rate 70%, HRT 24 h, and MLSS 3000 mg/L), the removal efficiencies for BOD and COD were 97.8 and 95.6%, respectively. Moreover, kinetics of the biological process showed that removal of organic matters for the tested wastewater adheres to modified Stover-Kincannon model with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. Ratio of BOD to COD of 0.6 (optimal range for biological treatment normally is [0.5) suggests acceptable efficiency of the reactor for decomposing organic load. A high overall efficiency of the process and fulfilling the related standards make this system an appropriate option for treating HDW.

AB Electro-Fenton (EF), an advanced oxidation process, can be combined with a biological process for efficient treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants such as pharmaceuticals. In this study, a biological process was implemented in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), which was either preceded or followed by EF treatment. The main goal was to evaluate the potential of two sequences of a combined electrochemical-biological process: EF/SBR and SBR/EF for the treatment of real wastewater spiked with 0.1 mM of caffeine and 5-fluorouracil. The biological removal of COD and pharmaceuticals was improved by extending the acclimation time and increasing concentration of biomass in the SBR. Hardly biodegradable caffeine and COD were completely removed during the EF post-treatment (SBR/EF). During the EF/SBR sequence, complete removal of pharmaceuticals was achieved by EF within 30 min at applied current 800 mA. With a current of 500 and 800 mA, the initially very low BOD5/COD ratio increased up to 0.38 and 0.58, respectively, after 30 min. The efficiency of the biological post-treatment was influenced by the biodegradability enhancement after EF pre-treatment. The choice of an adequate sequence of such a combined process is significantly related to the wastewater characteristics as well as the treatment objectives.

AB The merits of the sonophotolysis as a combination of sonolysis (US) and photolysis (UV/H2O2 are investigated in a pilot-scale external loop airlift sonophotoreactor for the treatment of a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater (SPWW). In the first part of this study, the multivariate experimental design is carried out using Box-Behnken design (BBD). The effluent is characterized by the total organic carbon (TOC) percent removal as a surrogate parameter. The results indicate that the response of the TOC percent removal is significantly affected by the synergistic effects of the linear term of H2O2 dosage and ultrasound power with the antagonistic effect of quadratic term of H2O2 dosage. The statistical analysis of the results indicates a satisfactory prediction of the system behavior by the developed model. In the second part of this study, a novel rigorous mathematical model for the sonophotolytic process is developed to predict the TOC percent removal as a function of time. The mathematical model is based on extensively accepted sonophotochemical reactions and the rate constants in advanced oxidation processes. A good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data indicates that the proposed model could successfully describe the sonophotolysis of the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Wastewater irrigation is often performed by flood irrigation, leading to changes in redox potential (Eh) of irrigated soils. In addition to soil organic matter, Fe-(hydr) oxides are important sorbents for pollutants, and biotransformation of pollutants can be accelerated under reducing conditions. Here, the influence of reducing conditions on the release of sorbed pharmaceuticals from soil and their potential accelerated dissipation was investigated in a microcosm study. Samples of a soil from the Mezquital Valley (Mexico) irrigated for 85 yr with untreated wastewater were incubated under oxidizing (Eh of 500 +/- 20 mV), weakly reducing (Eh of 100 +/- 20 mV), and moderately reducing (Eh of -100 +/- 20 mV) soil conditions for 30 to 31 d. The concentrations of nine pharmaceuticals (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, enrofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, and naproxen) were extracted via solid-phase extraction from soil slurries and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Low Eh did not lead to a release of formerly sorbed pharmaceuticals from the wastewater irrigated soil. High pH values (> 8) of the examined soil resulting from denitrification under reducing conditions prevented the dissolution of Fe-(hydr) oxides and, hence, the potential release of pharmaceuticals. A trend of decreasing concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate with time under moderately reducing conditions supports previous findings of a transformation of these compounds under anaerobic conditions.

AB Microalgae is considered the most promising source of oils for biodiesel production. Beside microalgae contain proteins and pigments, which have large applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Combining the cultivation of microalgae for the production of these compounds with wastewater treatment renders the overall process very attractive and economically feasible. However, the selection of the most suitable application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment depends on the composition of the harvested microalgae. In the present work, the effectiveness of Chlorella sp. for the degradation of p-cresol have been evaluated at a concentration ranging from 35 to 330 mg/L. The effect of initial concentration on the contaminants removal, biomass productivity and the chemical composition of microalgae has been determined. Results shows that, Chlorella sp. can degrade p-cresol at concentration up to 330 mg/L, and use it for biomass growth. Biochemical assay showed an improvement in the lipid productivity at higher concentrations, combined with the reduction in the protein content. The highest pigment composition was obtained at the optimum biomass growth, at 150 mg/L. These results give deep understanding of the factors that must be considered when integrating wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications.

AB A series of six pharmaceuticals were degraded by continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) ultrasound at 205 kHz using deionized water, wastewater effluent, and its isolated organic matter matrices. In deionized water, we observed that hydrophobicity is superior to diffusivity (D-W) for predicting degradation kinetics. Enhancements in degradation kinetics by the PW mode were greatest for the highest D-W (i.e., fluorouracil (5-FU)) and K-OW (i.e., lovastatin (LOVS)) compounds, indicating that a pharmaceutical with either high diffusivity and low hydrophobicity or low diffusivity and high hydrophobicity benefits from additional time to populate the bubble-water interface during the silent cycle of PW ultrasound. Degradation of 5-FU and LOVS were inhibited by wastewater effluent to a greater extent than the other pharmaceuticals. In addition, a pulse enhancement (PE) for 5-FU and LOVS was not present in wastewater effluent. Irradiating 5-FU and LOVS in hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI), and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions of effluent organic matter (EfOM) showed that the TPI fraction reduced the PE the most, followed by the HPI and HPO fractions. The smaller size of the TPI over the HPO fraction and higher hydrophobicity of TPI over HPI implicate both size and hydrophobicity of EfOM in hindering degradation of pharmaceuticals.

AB The Haihe River System (HRS) drains the Chinese megacities Beijing and Tianjin, forming a large-scale irrigation system severely impacted by wastewater-borne pollution. The origin, temporal magnitudes, and annual mass fluxes of a wide range of pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and pesticides were investigated in the HRS, which drains 70% of the wastewater discharged by 20 million people living in Beijing. Based on Chinese consumption statistics and our initial screening for 268 micropollutants using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 62 compounds were examined in space and time (2009-2010). The median concentrations ranged from 3 ng/L for metolachlor to 1100 ng/L for benzotriazole and sucralose. Concentrations of carbendazim, clarithromycin, diclofenac, and diuron exceed levels of ecotoxicological concern. Mass-flux analyses revealed that pharmaceuticals (5930 kg/year) and most household chemicals (5660 kg/year) originated from urban wastewaters, while the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole entered the rivers through other pathways. Total pesticide residues amounted to 1550 kg/year. Per capita loads of pharmaceuticals in wastewater were lower than those in Europe, but are expected to increase in the near future. As 95% of the river water is diverted to irrigate agricultural soil, the loads of polar organic micropollutants transported with the water might pose a serious threat to food safety and groundwater quality.

AB Wastewater from a pharmaceutical and chemical company provides the material of this study. The company produces drugs, diuretics, laboratory chemicals and others. The company is located 30 km north of Cairo, and discharges both industrial (1050 m(3)/d) and human wastewater (8400 m(3)/d) without treatment into a near-by evaporation pond. Reduction of pollutants in the wastewater down to permissible concentrations is necessary for the protection of ground water and the environment. Analysis of the combined wastes indicated that it is very acidic and contains high concentrations of organic compounds and total solids. Combined wastes were subjected to different treatment processes for final disposal into surface water, or reuse for irrigation purposes. Biological treatment of the combined wastes was carried out using both batch and continuous flow systems. The biological treatments included activated sludge process, fixed film reactor, and fixed film reactor followed by activated sludge process. Technical feasibility studies indicated that good quality effluent could be obtained using either extended aeration (20 hr aeration) or a fixed film reactor followed by activated sludge (11 hr detention time). Residual BOD5, COD, oil and grease concentrations in the treated effluent were complying with the National Regularity Standards. When constructional cost was considered extended aeration was the first choice. Engineering designs of the proposed treatment options are included. (C) 1996 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We established a method for the simultaneous analysis of seven preservatives and five antimicrobials in water. These chemicals are widely used in cosmetics, and their presence in river water is of concern. We used the method to test 13 sites in Japanese rivers and streams contaminated by domestic wastewater, effluent, or industrial wastewater. 2-Phenoxyethanol (2-PE), isopropylmethylphenol, resorcinol, and triclosan were detected at most sites; the maximum concentration of 2-PE detected was 14000 ng L-1. The results suggest that the major sources of 2-PE were cosmetics and household detergents. The ratio of methylparaben to n-propylparaben in river waters with direct wastewater drainage was similar to that in common cosmetics. This is the first research on levels of 2-PE, isopropylmethylphenol, and chlorphenesin in river water. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The omnipresence of pharmaceuticals at relatively high concentrations (mu g/L) in environmental compartments indicated their inadequate removal by wastewater treatment plants. As such, batch reactors seeded with activated sludge were set up to assess the biotransformation of metformin, ranitidine, lidocaine and atorvastatin. The main objective was to identify transformation products (TPs) through the establishment of an integrated workflow for suspect and non-target screening based on reversed phase liquid chromatography quadrupoletime-of-flight mass spectrometry. To support the identification, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was used as a complementary tool, in order to enhance the completeness of the developed workflow by identifying the more polar 1 Ps. The structure assignment/elucidation of the candidate TPs was mainly based on interpretation of MS/MS spectra. Twenty-two TPs were identified, with fourteen of them reaching high identification confidence levels (level 1: confirmed structure by reference standards and level 2: probable structure by library spectrum match and diagnostic evidence). Finally, retrospective analysis in influent and effluent wastewater was performed for the TPs for four consecutive years in wastewater sampled in Athens, Greece. The potential toxicological threat of the compounds to the aquatic environment was assessed and atorvastatin with two of its TPs showed a potential risk to the aquatic organisms.

   Alternative green treatment techniques
AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are vital to human health and welfare, but following therapeutic use, they may pose a potential ecological risk if discharged into the environment. Today's conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove APIs specifically, and various techniques, preferably cost-effective and environmentally friendly, are being developed and evaluated. Microalgae-based treatment of wastewater is a sustainable and low-cost approach to remove nutrients and emerging contaminants. In this study, a North Sweden high-rate algal pond (HRAP) using municipal untreated wastewater as medium, was investigated in terms of API distribution and fate. Three six-day batches were prepared during 18 days and a total of 36 APIs were quantified within the HRAP of which 14 were removed from the aqueous phase above 50% and seven removed above 90% of their initial concentrations. Twelve APIs of a hydrophobic nature were mostly associated with the algal biomass that was harvested at the end of each batch. HRAPs treatment successfully removed 69% of studied APIs (25 of 36 studied) in six day time. The distribution of various APIs between the aqueous phase and biomass suggested that several removal mechanisms may occur, such as hydrophobicity driven removal, passive biosorption and active bioaccumulation.

AB Numerous substances from different chemical sectors, from the pharmaceutical industry to the many consumer products available for everyday usage, can find their way into water intended for human consumption and wastewater, and can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. Thus, the disinfection process is an essential stage in water and wastewater treatment plants to destroy pathogenic microorganisms but it can form degradation byproducts. Sodium hypochlorite is the most common disinfectant, but the most important drawback associated with this kind of compound is the generation of toxic disinfection byproducts. Many studies have been carried out to identify alternative disinfectants, and in the last few years, peracetic acid has been highlighted as a feasible solution, particularly in wastewater treatment. This study compares the transformations of five emerging pollutants (caffeine, tramadol, irbesartan, diclofenac, trazodone) treated with peracetic acid, to evaluate their degradation and the possible formation of byproducts with those obtained with sodium hypochlorite. Although peracetic acid has many advantages, including a wide field of use against microorganisms and a low toxicity towards animal and plant organisms, it is not as effective in the degradation of the considered pollutants. These ones are recovered substantially and are unchanged quantitatively, producing a very low number of byproducts.

AB Nowadays, the treatment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) wastewaters are a serious concern because of the use of these materials as a solvent in various industries such as pharmaceutical, electronic and acrylic fiber manufacturing process. In this research, employing of Fenton process for treatment of DMSO and DMAC wastewaters by considering the effect of operating parameters such as different initial DMSO and DMAC concentration, reaction time, initial pH, and different concentrations of Fenton's reagent were investigated. Experimental results illustrated that the maximum degradation efficiency for the treatment of synthetic DMSO wastewater was equal to 89.9 %, 89.7 %, 94.5 %, and 97.6 %, for initial concentration of DMSO equal to 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg.L-1, respectively. The maximum degradation efficiency of 81.9 %, 92.9 %, 94.8 %, and 95.8 % was reached at best operational conditions of the Fenton process for 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg.L-1 initial concentration of synthetic DMAC wastewater respectively. Kinetics study results presented that the kinetic reaction of DMSO and DMAC degradation by the Fenton process at all initial concentrations were well fitted with the BMG model.

AB In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were studied for their potentials as novel adsorbents for trace concentrations of phosphorus and aluminum in water and wastewater. Static adsorption results demonstrated that CNT and rGO employed in this study removed up to 65.6% of total dissolved Al and 98.9% of P from a natural surface water and a secondary wastewater effluent. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between CNT/rGO and oxyanions were hypothesized to contribute to the adsorption process. Accordingly, acetaminophen (AAP), a pharmaceutical compound known to form hydrogen bonding with CNT, was spiked into the real water as a competitor for P and Al adsorption. Subsequent sorption results showed that the presence of AAP reduced Al and P adsorption by CNT and rGO by 9.3%-18.4% and 11.2%-18.2%, respectively. These results suggest that hydrogen bonding interactions with CNT/rGO influenced the adsorption of P and Al species. In addition, pH effect investigation on Al/P removal further verified the above opinion. Overall, this study provided important evidence and insights into CNT/rGO adsorption of P and Al species from water and wastewater, which expanded our understanding on the ability of carbonaceous nanomaterials for advanced water and wastewater treatment.

AB Aniline aerofloat (DDA) is a widely used material in China and has become a main pollutant in floatation wastewater. In this study, a membrane reactor (MBR) was constructed to continuously treat simulated wastewater contaminated with DDA. The study investigated the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the impact of influent DDA concentration on MBR performance, and analyzed intermediates from the DDA biodegradation pathway and activated sludge transfer pathway. The results showed that a 3 h HRT was an efficient and economical time period for MBR to remove 95 +/- 5 mg/L DDA from the simulated wastewater; the chemical oxygen demand reduction rate was 89.9%. DDA concentration negatively impacted MBR performance. MBR performance fluctuated slightly when HRT was 3 h, dissolved oxygen ranged from 4.8 to 5.3 mg/L, pH was between 6.5 and 7.0, and DDA concentrations were at 95 +/- 5 mg/L DDA. The transfer pathway in the activated sludge of DDA was through soluble microbial products, loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances, tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances, and finally cell biodegradation. DDA initially degraded to aniline; the aniline was further biodegraded to other organic compounds and was finally mineralized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This study offers a new continuous biological treatment technology to address DDA.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater may contain high-value pharmaceutically active compounds such as amlodipine. A hollow-fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) process was developed and applied in the pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater for (S)-amlodipine recovery. The HFSLM system contained O,O'-dibenzoyl-(2S,3S)-tartaric acid ((+)-DBTA) in the liquid membrane phase and beta-cyclodextrin in the stripping phase. The effects of various chemical parameters, including the concentration of the chiral selector in the stripping phase, as well as the type of organic diluent and the carrier concentration in the membrane, were also investigated. Several diluents - hexane, 1-decanol, chlorobenzene, benzene, dichloromethane, ethylene dichloride, and chloroform - with different polarity indexes, from 0.1 to 4.1, were used. The results found that the polarity of the diluents was the main factor influencing the extraction performance and stability of the liquid membrane. Decreasing the polarity of the diluent could prolong membrane stability, but the percentages of extraction and stripping decreased as well. The longest lifetime (150 min) was obtained by using 1-decanol, with a polarity index of 1.8, as a diluent. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work evaluated the removal efficiency of 13 wastewater-borne pharmaceuticals in a pilot constructed wetland (CW) operated under different aeration strategies (no aeration, intermittent and continuous). Aeration improved the removal of conventional wastewater parameters and the targeted micropollutants, compared to the non-aerated treatment. Reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) was slightly higher applying intermittent aeration than applying continuous aeration, the opposite was observed for the investigated pharmaceuticals. Seven targeted compounds were found in influent wastewater, and five of them (acetaminophen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil) were efficiently removed (> 83%) in the aerated systems. The overall risk of the investigated samples against aquatic ecosystems was moderate, decreasing in the order influent > no aeration > intermittent aeration > continuous aeration, based on the hazard quotient approach. Lorazepam, diclofenac and ketoprofen were the pharmaceuticals that could contribute the most to this potential environmental impact of the CW effluents after discharge. To the authors? knowledge this is the first sound study on the removal and fate of ketoprofen, bezafibrate, and lorazepam in aerated CWs, and provides additional evidence on the removal and fate of acetaminophen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, and carbamazepine in this type of bioremediation systems at pilot plant scale.

AB The fate of selected common pharmaceuticals and four of their major conjugates in wastewater batch bioreactors was evaluated to determine how treatment plant parameters such as addition of air, and the presence of waste activated sludge (WAS) could influence the removal of parent compounds and conjugates. Under a realistic hydraulic residence time (HRT) for each treatment sub-process of approximately 2 h, acetaminophen and its sulfate metabolite were both rapidly degraded (>99%). Propranolol was sulfated and concurrently removed. Deconjugation of N-acetylsulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole-glucuronide contributed to increases of the parent sulfamethoxazole. Thyroxine was resistant to degradation, while thyroxine-glucuronide was rapidly deconjugated (>90% in <2 h). In the absence of WAS, sorption to suspended solids was another major removal mechanism for acetaminophen, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, and thyroxine. However, with WAS, concentrations associated with suspended solids decreased for all analytes within 24 h. These results indicate that both conjugation and back-transformation are compound-specific and dependent on parameters such as HRT, addition of microbial content, and suspended solids levels. Therefore, conjugation-deconjugation processes may strongly influence the speciation of pharmaceuticals and their fate in wastewater treatment plant effluents. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the endocrine disrupting effects of domestic wastewater on fish using the brackish medaka Oryzias melastigma as the animal model. Estuarine water samples were collected from Sihchong Creek and Baoli Creek estuaries, Taiwan, in March of 2012 to assess the whole effluent toxicity (WET) of domestic wastewater produced by the local residents and tourists. Chemical analysis detected various pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the field water samples. Some of these PPCPs are endocrine disrupting chemicals. In the laboratory-based bioassay, breeding pairs were exposed to the water samples (Sihchong, Baoli, and control) for 21 days. Cumulative number of eggs spawned was significantly higher in the Sihchong group. While fish swimming activity was not affected, sexual behavior of the male fish was significantly induced in both Sihchong and Baoli groups. Male and female gonad histology was not affected. Expression level of biomarker genes CYP1A1, HSP70, and VTG was significantly induced in the Sihchong group. This study indicates that the mixture of contaminants contained in the estuarine water may cause endocrine disrupting effects in fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, attention has been drawn toward the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. In recent years, many reports have been made on the occurrence of the large, differentiated group of pharmaceuticals in wastewater (PW), surface water, ground water, and in soil. The pharmaceutical sector is currently expanding in Tunisia, with more than 34 industries. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 to treat PW. P. putida was very efficient in reducing chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity of solution (85.5, 89.1, and 81.5%, respectively). Genotoxicity of effluent, before and after biodegradation, was evaluated in vivo in mouse bone marrow by assessing the percentage of cells bearing different chromosome aberrations. Results indicated that PW showed a significant ability to induce DNA damage. In addition, PW induced a remarkable lipid peroxidation (LPO) effect, however, activities of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were unchanged when treated with PW, compared to nontreated PW. This toxicity was imputed to the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater. However, chromosome aberration, as well as LPO of PW, were significantly reduced after bioremediation. Thus, the use of this strain for testing on the industrial scale seems possible and advantageous.

AB This study assessed the potential of ozone for the degradation of nine commonly used veterinary antibiotics (five sulfonamides, three tetracyclines, and one macrolide) in swine wastewater pretreated by sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The apparent second-order rate constants for the reactions of selected antibiotics toward ozone in Milli-Q water (k(O3) at pH 7.0 and T = 20 degrees C) were determined by competition kinetics as follows: sulfonamides [(1.9-6.2) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)], tetracyclines (6.9 x 10(6) to 1.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1)), and tiamulin (3.8 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The antibiotics could be quickly degraded by ozone in the SBR effluent with degradation rates following the order of their k(O3) values. In the SBR effluent, the dissolved organic materials strongly competed for oxidants against antibiotics, while the suspended solids had insignificant influence on antibiotics degradation. The reaction mechanism was primarily direct oxidation via ozone rather than indirect oxidation via hydroxyl radicals. Overall, ozonation is a feasible polishing process, subsequent to biological treatment, for removal of residual antibiotics from swine wastewater. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000404.

ID SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO; MODEL; SYSTEMS; PPCPS
AB Wastewater production, like many other engineered and environmental processes, is inherent stochastic in nature and requires the use of complex stochastic models, for example, to predict realistic patterns of down-the-drain chemicals or pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Up until now, a formal method of statistical inference has been lacking for many of those models, where explicit likelihood functions were intractable. In this Article, we investigate Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to infer important parameters of stochastic environmental models. ABC methods have been recently suggested to perform model-based inference in a Bayesian setting when model likelihoods are analytically or computationally intractable and have not been applied to environmental systems analysis or water quality modeling before. In a case study, we investigate the performance of three different algorithms to infer the number of wastewater pulses contained in three high-resolution data series of benzotriazole and total nitrogen loads in sewers. We find that all algorithms perform well and that the uncertainty in the inferred number of corresponding wastewater pulses varies between 6% and 28%. In our case, the results are more sensitive to substance characteristics than to catchment properties. Although the application of ABC methods requires careful tuning and attention to detail, they have a great general potential to update stochastic model parameters with monitoring data and improve their predictive capabilities.

AB Cyclooxygenase (COX) plays an important role in eicosanoid metabolism. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) function as COX inhibitors and are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. Here, we measured the in vitro COX-inhibiting activity of the surface water and domestic wastewater in the Tone Canal, Japan. The concentrations of several NSAIDs in the some samples were also determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for confirming the validity of the assay. The target compounds were extracted from the samples using a solid-phase extraction cartridge. A dose-response relationship between the inhibiting activity and sample volume were observed in the wastewater sample. The higher COX-inhibiting activities were observed in the wastewater sample, as compared with the samples of the surface water in the canal. These inhibiting activities reflected the trends of NSAIDs distribution in the canal. However, the inhibiting activities of the water samples could not be entirely explained by the NSAIDs that were selected for instrumental analysis in this study. Other compounds that were not measured by instrumental analysis in this study might contribute to the inhibiting activities. Therefore, the COX-inhibiting assay would be effective for evaluating inclusive ecotoxicity in the aquatic environment.

AB Advancements on analytical strategies to determine the chemicals present in treated wastewater are necessary to clearly link their occurrence with the ecotoxicity of such effluents. This study describes the development of an integrated screening approach to determine the highest number of pharmaceutical transformation products (TPs) in a single run. The identification of TPs was based on the comparison of detected features with literature sources, compound prediction tools, in-house libraries and reference standards using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This integrated approach allowed a better estimation (in silica) of the ecotoxicological contribution of the individual TPs identified. As a proof of concept, this methodology was applied for identification of the TPs generated from metoprolol and its main human metabolite (metoprolol acid) in pure water, hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater treated by UV/H2O2. Twenty-four TPs with potential ecotoxicological implications were identified and their presence was pinpointed as a function of the treated wastewater. An integrated screening approach has been developed using four different screening methodologies in the same run. Additionally, the metabolite MTPA has been considered as a target pollutant in UV/H2O2 experiments.

AB A comparative study of the photocatalytic efficiency obtained in water disinfection and the simultaneous removal of micropollutants was carried out by using three different TiO2 photocatalytic materials. The three photocatalysts were immobilized in macroporous reticulated ZrO2 3D foams and their efficiency was compared with that obtained in suspensions for the treatment of synthetic and real wastewater. The results obtained show similar photocatalytic efficiencies for the three photocatalysts used, showing the catalysts WTT-P and AQ1 to be an alternative to the common use of P25 catalyst. The use of supported photocatalysts in the treatment of synthetic water showed lower efficiencies compared to the suspended photocatalysts due to the existence of diffusive limitations caused by the low concentration of the micropollutants. However, these differences were not observed when treating a wastewater treatment effluent. In this case, the non-selective action of the hydroxyl radicals causes the loss of a significant part of the available radicals for the oxidation of non-target compounds present in the water. Consequently, diffusion was not identified as the limiting stage of the removal rate, but the availability of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction medium, which allows the 3D foams to be as effective as the processes in suspension.

AB Direct immersion solid-phase microextraction has been optimized and applied to the simultaneous determination of the neutral and basic pharmaceuticals: caffeine, carbamazepine, clomipramine, chlorprothixene and clotrimazole at low concentrations in municipal wastewater. Two absorption type stationary phases: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyacrylate (PA) have been found to be most effective for extraction of target analytes. The separation and detection were carried out by gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer working in the selected ion monitoring mode. The method was validated for linearity, detection and quantitation limits, selectivity and precision. The average correlation coefficient of the calibration curves was 0.9933. The LOD values in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 10-145 ng L-1 and 4-111 ng L-1, respectively, which were a bit higher than those in the deionized water due to matrix effect. The high values of distribution coefficient (K (fs) ) in PDMS/water and PA/water systems (log K (fs) between 3.05 and 4.23) indicates the very high applicability of these stationary phases for determination of carbamazepine, clomipramine, chlorprothixene and clotrimazole in water samples.

AB This work provides physicochemical solutions for the treatment of process wastewaters of fine chemical industries, that is, pharmaceutical industry. Economical methods are recommended for practical use, which can reduce the disposal ratio of the process wastewaters with higher values of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Adsorbable Organically Bound Halogens (AOX) than the corresponding emission limits. Such treatment alternatives are also the part of environmental sustainability.
   The work reviews the theoretical background of the problem and gives options for using the waste management hierarchy chart. Then the general features of pharmaceutical process wastewaters and the treatment methods are summarized. In the algorithm developed for process wastewater treatment, the distillation is the core of the physicochemical treatment alternatives. In the case of the real industrial case studies, the distillation and membrane filtration laboratory experiments and cost calculations prove the efficiency of the selected physicochemical treatment options.

AB The biodegradation of selected non-adsorbing persistent polar pollutants (P) during wastewater (WW) treatment was studied by comparing a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) running in parallel to activated sludge treatment (AST). The investigated P-3 are relevant representatives or metabolites from the compound classes: pesticides, pharmaceuticals, insect repellents, flame retardants and anionic surfactants. Analyses of all these P-3 at low ng L-1 levels with sufficient standard deviations was performed in WW influents and effluents. Non-degradable micropollutants, such as EDTA and carbamazepine were not eliminated at all during WW treatment by any technique. However, the MBR showed significant better removals compared to AST for the investigated poorly biodegradable P-3, such as diclofenac, mecoprop and sulfophenylcarboxylates. An application of such an in terms of sludge retention time optimised MBR may lead to a reduction of these P-3 in the watercycle. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB WIDESPREAD occurrence of pharmaceuticals has started to attract attention as aquatic micropollutants that might have been affecting the ecological system in trace amounts. The risks associated with their introduction into wildlife habitats is becoming an important issue for both regulators and the pharmaceutical industry, because of incomplete elimination of pharmaceuticals wastewater and their metabolites. In this study there are different classes of pharmaceuticals nonsteroidal anti inflammatory (naproxen) and psychoactive drug CNS stimulants (caffeine). This work aims to remove some of pharmaceutical residues in industrial wastewater. The identification and quantification of chemical and pharmaceutical residues was explored using Gas Chromatography with Mass detector GC/MS spectrometer and the analytical method was used Environmental Protection Agency method (EPA625) determination of the concentration in industrial wastewater using liquid chromatography-based tandem mass spectrometry LC/MS/MS spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI) and the analytical method was used (EPA 1694). The study recorded occurring of different types of pharmaceutical residues with different concentration levels in wastewater. The concentration levels in wastewater were detected for caffeine at 9465 ng mL(-1) and for Naproxen at 2 ng mL(-1) these concentrations representing about 500 fold higher than international safety margin of treated wastewater that the studies conducted in the United Kingdom, the USA and Australia have shown that concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water are typically less than 0.05 ng mL(-1). Magnetic activated carbon (MAC) is proposed as a new techniqe for the adsorption of pharmaceutical residues (Caffeine and Naproxen). The isotherms as well as adsorption kinetics are explored. The results obtained high adsorption capacity of caffeine and naproxen over MAC which has reached 1.8 mg g(-1) and 1.6 mg g(-1) after 15 min for both caffeine and naproxen. First order model is fitted well with the experimental results through a correlation coefficient (0.978) for (caffeine) and second order model is fitted well with the experimental results through a correlation coefficient (0.9887) for (Naproxen). Moreover, the adsorption of both (caffeine and naproxen) on MAC is proceeded using freundlish isotherm model considering correlation coefficient (0.953 and 0.948) respectively. The benefits of using MAC are the low cost of synthesis and its easy and fast separation from solution by using a magnet.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment plants are ineffective in removing a broad range of micropollutants, resulting in the release of these compounds into the aquatic environment, including natural drinking water resources. Ozonation is a suitable treatment process for micropollutant removal, although, currently, little is known about the formation, behavior, and removal of transformation products (TP) formed during ozonation. We investigated the elimination of 30 selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, industrial chemicals, and TP) by biological treatment coupled with ozonation and, subsequently, in parallel with two biological filters (BF) or granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. The selected micropollutants were removed to very different extents during the conventional biological wastewater treatment process. Ozonation (specific ozone consumption: 0.87 +/- 0.29 g(03) g(DOG)(-1) hydraulic retention time: 17 +/- 3 min) eliminated a large number of the investigated micropollutants. Although 11 micropollutants could still be detected after ozonation, most of these were eliminated in subsequent GAC filtration at bed volumes (BV) of approximately 25,000 m(3) m(-3). In contrast, no additional removal of micropollutants was achieved in the BF. Ozonation of the analgesic tramadol led to the formation of tramadol-N-oxide that is effectively eliminated by GAC filters, but not by BF. For the antiviral drug acyclovir, the formation of carboxy-acyclovir was observed during activated sludge treatment, with an average concentration of 3.4 +/- 1.4 mu g L-1 detected in effluent samples. Subsequent ozonation resulted in the complete elimination of carboxy-acyclovir and led to the formation of N-(4-carbamoyl-2-imino-5oxo imidazolidin)-formamido-N-methoxyacetetic acid (COFA; average concentration: 2.6 +/- 1.0 mu g L-1). Neither the BF nor the GAC filters were able to remove COFA. These results highlight the importance of considering TP in the evaluation of advanced wastewater treatment processes. The results further indicate that post-treatment of ozonated wastewater with GAC filtration seems to be more suitable than BF, due to the sorption of formed TP to the activated carbon.

AB Irrigation with treated wastewater could lead to the accumulation of caffeine in agricultural fresh. Caffeine is one of the most frequently detected compounds in treated wastewater; however, little is known about its subcellular distribution and metabolism in vegetables. This study reported the uptake, subcellular distribution, and metabolism of 14C-caffeine in Chinese flowering cabbage and water spinach. The results showed that 98% of caffeine lost from solution after 768 h of cultivation. Caffeine was taken up by vegetables and most 14C-activity was accumulated in the bottom leaves. At the subcellular level, 14C-activity was mainly distributed in the organelles in root and stem cells, while in the leafy cells it was dominant in the solution. The metabolism of caffeine was investigated using LC-QTOF-MS. Caffeine underwent demethylation forming xanthine and theobromine, and mineralization to release CO2. Approximately 40.2% of the initially applied caffeine was accumulated in Chinese flowering cabbage as the parent compound (28.3%) and metabolites (11.9%), and 50.9% of the added caffeine was mineralized to CO2 after 768 h of exposure. The knowledge obtained herein is key to evaluating potential risks of caffeine present in treated wastewater, and the quality and safety of agricultural fresh produced by irrigation with treated wastewater.

AB Due to population growth and economic development, there has been an increase in global wastewater (WW) generation footprint. There are different technologies associated with the wastewater treatment (WWT) process. The challenge is to select technologies that minimize the cost of treatment, as well as meet purity requirements. Further, there is a need to integrate sustainability analysis to facilitate a holistic decision. With the application of systems engineering, sustainable and cost-effective solutions can be achieved. In this work, we apply systems engineering to generate a sustainable and cost-effective solution. A superstructure was generated by categorizing technologies into four treatment stages. After modeling all functional equations for each technology, an optimization problem was formulated to determine the best path for the treatment process. Mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), which implements a 0-1 binary integer constraint for active/inactive technologies at each stage was used. Sustainability analysis was performed for each representative case study (municipal and pharmaceutical WWT) using the sustainable process index (SPI). The total cost of municipal WWT is 1.92 USD/m(3), while that for the pharmaceutical WWT is 3.44 USD/m(3). With the treatment of WW, there is a reduction of over 90% ecological burden based on the SPI metric.

AB The present study shows the results of solar photo-Fenton oxidation of paracetamol (PCT) and amoxicillin (AMX). Fe-2(SO4)(3) was used as the source of iron and EDDS as the iron complexing agent, employing different doses of hydrogen peroxide. Two aqueous matrices, a synthetic wastewater and real wastewater from El Ejido WWTP effluent (Almeria) were used. In all cases, the process was operated under conditions of natural sunlight.
   Results showed that the degradation of both drugs is favoured when the aqueous matrix presents low concentration of carbonates. Under the conditions studied here, degradation percentages above 90% were obtained in the synthetic wastewater and 80% in the actual effluent. The degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight analyser. The intermediates detected throughout the oxidative process for both micro-contaminants were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions.
   The toxicity of the samples was determined using the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. In the acute toxicity test, it was observed that the bacteria did not undergo inhibition in any of the cases. However, chronic toxicity studies showed that the higher the Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) employed in the assays, the higher the bacterial inhibition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of 11 synthetic polycyclic musks in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Jilin, China, by using a membrane bioreactor combined with anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The analysis of synthetic polycyclic musks was conducted with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. The removal efficiency of 11 synthetic polycyclic musks ranged from 65.9% (3-methylcyclopentadecanone) to 84.6% (Galoxolide) in the influent. Along the treatment process, it was observed that the anaerobic tank could remove the synthetic polycyclic musks effectively whereas the role of the membrane was to the musks, which could be ascribed to the relatively strong hydrophobic property of the musks. The sludge-water distribution coefficients (K-d values) as indicator of adsorption propensity for the sludge from anaerobic, anoxic, oxic and membrane tanks were measured. The high value of K-d, above 5.0 litres per gram of suspended solids, showed most of the musks could be removed by sludge through the adsorption process; thus the removal rate from the water phase caused by adsorption in the wastewater treatment plant can be predicted.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane processes were developed for municipal wastewater reclamation, and their performances, in terms of trace contaminant control and fouling mitigation, were evaluated and designed to meet water quality criteria and minimize flux decline. The dissolved contaminants in wastewater were poorly degraded by MBR but the microbial nitrification in MBR could greatly contribute to nitrogen removal in the MBR permeate through the addition of a NF membrane. Furthermore, most dissolved contaminants were efficiently removed by the NF membrane. However, the NF membrane was ineffective in the removal of boron. The org-N/C molar ratio was inversely correlated to SUVA and directly corresponded to the 3D FEEM, structural analysis, and IR spectra of organic matter in raw and treated water, and desorbed foulants. The observations obtained from rigorous characterization revealed that the hydrophilic fractions, which were comprised of polysaccharides and amino groups, played a major role in fouling formation of the MBR-NF system. In addition, strong amide IR peak in the NF-base supported the notion that amino groups were primarily responsible for the fouling formation of the NF membrane relative to the polysaccharides groups.

AB The occurrence of thirty-one selected Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) and Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) was analyzed in eleven major municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) in Seoul, Korea over two consecutive days. The area was selected since there was a lack of information in the Seoul area on the suspected contamination of wastewater effluents by micropollutants. Discharge from those major WWTPs accounted for approximately 25% of the Han River flow where over 99% of drinking water is produced from surface waters in this area that has a population approximately 15 million inhabitants. Samples collected in WWTP effluents were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI). Many target compounds were detected in the effluent samples (66%). Atenolol, iopromide, TCPP, TCEP, musk ketone, naproxen, DEET, carbamazepine, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and benzophenone were frequently detected in effluent samples with mean concentrations ranging from 98 to 663 ng/L (maximum = 230-1,700 ng/L). However, the steroid hormones (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone), atrazine (herbicide), and octylphenol (surfactant) were not detected in all the samples. Results of this study can provide evidence that WWTP effluent is one of the major sources contaminating the Han River.

AB Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) undergoing incomplete removal during wastewater treatment may be found in treated wastewater (TWW) used for irrigation of agricultural products. Following uptake into edible plant parts, EOCs may eventually enter in the food chain, with associated human exposure. In the present study, we used a newly developed steady-state plant uptake model with added phloem transport to predict the uptake of four EOCs (carbamazepine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) into three varieties of lettuce. Input data were derived from an experimental study with vegetables grown in greenhouse and irrigated with TWW spiked with CBZ at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 210 mu g/L in each variety of lettuce.
   Predicted carbamazepine concentrations in leaves were on average 82% higher than in roots, with good agreement between measured and calculated data. We subsequently predicted the uptake of anti-inflammatory compounds ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, for which the chemical analysis could not provide concentrations above detection limit. These three substances are weak acids and predicted concentrations in roots were higher than in the edible leaves, mainly due to phloem transport downwards. The daily dietary intake of all four EOCs was estimated for consumption of leafy vegetables, being far below usual therapeutic doses.

AB In this work the effectiveness of membrane bioreactors as advanced treatment on the removal of emergent and priority organic compounds in wastewater treatment plants has been evaluated during a one-year monitoring study. The studied wastewater treatment plant operates with flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes in two parallel lines. Moreover, a reverse osmosis module connected in series after the hollow fibre membrane was evaluated for one month. Comparison of membrane bioreactor and conventional activated sludge treatment was also investigated, as well as the influence of the physicochemical properties of the compounds on the removal rates achieved. Sixteen pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups and eight priority organic pollutants, including linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, nonylphenol and its ethoxylates and phthalate, were monitored. The highest mean concentrations corresponded to priority organic pollutants (309 mu g L-1 of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate C-12) followed by pharmaceutical compounds (24.5 mu g L-1 of ibuprofen). No significant difference of effectiveness was found among flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes. However, an improvement was obtained with the addition of a reverse osmosis module for most of the compounds. Biodegradation has been shown as the main route involved in the removal of organic compounds during both technologies.

ID ELECTRODE
AB This is a preliminary investigation of a method for the timely monitoring of wastewater biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Many ecological and economic pressures support the use of BOD measurement methods fast enough to prevent process upsets. Since the standard laboratory procedure takes five days, and previously used fast tests are unsatisfactory for various reasons, tests were made on the Nissin Electric BOD-2000 instrument, which uses a yeast-based biosensor to measure soluble BOD in 30 min. It has been used successfully in the pharmaceutical and food industries. An initial attempt was made to place the instrument in field service. This attempt was unsuccessful, so the present study concentrated on comparing its operation in the laboratory with the results of the standard five-day BOD test (BOD,) procedure. The two types of tests were compared for samples from Terminal Island Treatment Plant (TITP), Bureau of Sanitation of the city of Los Angeles, using various combinations of filter porosities and wastewater sources in an attempt to establish a measurement routine that would not suffer from clogging problems that plagued the field test. Under these conditions the results from the instrument are excellent, and we briefly discuss further work needed to bring it into field use. This test is believed to be the first effort to assess the capability of this technology in a wastewater application in the United States.

AB With the hypothesis that light supply can impact the removal of veterinary antibiotics during livestock wastewater treatment in high rate algal ponds (HRAPs), this study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms of tetracycline removal in these systems. For this purpose, two HRAPs were fed with synthetic wastewater for 46 days before tetracycline was added at 2 mg L-1 to the influent of one of the reactors (Te-HRAP). From day 62, dissolved tetracycline removal stabilized around 69 +/- 1% in the Te-HRAP and evidence from batch assays suggests that this removal was mainly caused by photodegradation and biosorption. Tetracycline addition was followed by the deflocculation of the Te-HRAP biomass but had otherwise no apparent impact on the removal of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biomass productivity. The results from the batch assays also suggested that the light-shading and/or pollutant-sequestrating effects of the biomass limited tetracycline removal in the pond. For the first time, these results demonstrate that the shallow geometry of HRAPs is advantageous to support the photodegradation of antibiotics during wastewater biological treatment but that the presence of these pollutants could hamper biomass recovery. These findings have significant implications for algal-based environmental biotechnologies and must be confirmed under field conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photochemical transformation driven by sunlight is one of the most important natural processes for organic contaminant attenuation. In the current study, statistical analysis-assisted high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to investigate the phototransformation of nontarget features in wastewater effluents under various radical quenching/enhancing conditions. A total of 9694 nontarget features were extracted from the effluents, including photoresistant features, photolabile features, and transformation products. 65% of the wastewater effluent features were photoresistant, and the photolabile features could be classified into five groups: direct photolysis group (group I), HO center dot-originated species-dominated group (group II), 3OM*-dominated group (group III), photochemically produced reactive intermediates combination-dominated group (group IV), and non-first-order degradation group (group V). The direct photolyzed features were observed to degrade significantly faster than the indirect photolyzed features. Moreover, group II dominated by HO center dot-originated species contributed 34% to the photolabile features. The reaction types that occurred in the phototransformation process were analyzed by linkage analysis. The results suggested that oxygen addition and dealkyl group reactions were the most common reaction types identified in the phototransformation process. Overall, high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with statistical analysis was applied here to understand the photochemical behavior of the unknown features in wastewater effluents.

AB Struvite crystallization is an interesting method for the recovery of phosphorus (P) from wastewater. However, the struvite crystals obtained are small, which makes them difficult to separate from wastewater. A continuous reactor for enlarging struvite crystals was developed. Batch-scale experiments were conducted to investigate the optimum factors for the enlargement of struvite crystals. The results of pH experiments showed that P recovery efficiency increased with an increase of pH values (7.6 to 10), while the size of struvite crystals decreased. The results of the Mg:P ratios found that the maximum P recovery efficiency occurred at the maximum ratio of Mg:P. The sizes of struvite crystals were not significantly different. For the variation of temperature values, the results showed that P recovery efficiency and crystal sizes decreased when temperature values increased. Therefore, the optimized conditions for P recovery efficiency and enlargement of struvite crystals for the continuous reactor were pH 8.5 and an Mg: P ratio of 1.2:1 at 30 degrees C (room temperature). The treated swine wastewater and seawater were continuously fed in at the bottom of the reactor. After 30 days, the size of struvite crystals had increased from 125 mu m to 0.83 mm (seven times).

AB Two kinetic models were established for conservative estimates of photodegradation rates of contaminants under sunlight irradiation, in particular for wastewater stabilisation ponds and clarifiers in conventional wastewater treatment plants. These two models were designated for (1) contaminants with high photolytic rates or high photolytic quantum yields, whose photodegradation is unlikely to be enhanced by aquatic photosensitisers; and (2) contaminants withstanding direct photolysis in sunlit waters but subjected to indirect photolysis. The effortlessly intelligible prediction procedure involves sampling and analysis of real water samples, simulated solar experiments in the laboratory, and transfer of the laboratory results to realise water treatment using the prediction models. Although similar models have been widely used for laboratory studies, this paper provides a preliminary example of translating laboratory results to the photochemical fate of contaminants in real waters.

AB The peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation process was evaluated for the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color from healthcare wastewater. A 2-level full factorial design with center points was created to investigate the effect of the process parameters, i.e., initial COD, H2O2, pH, reaction time and current density. Furthermore, the total energy consumption and average current efficiency in the system were evaluated. Predictive models for % COD, % color removal and energy consumption were obtained. The initial COD and pH were found to be the most significant variables in the reduction of COD and color in peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation process. Hydrogen peroxide only has a significant effect on the treated wastewater when combined with other input variables in the process like pH, reaction time and current density. In the peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation process, current density appears not as a single effect but rather as an interaction effect with H2O2 in reducing COD and color. Lower energy expenditure was observed at higher initial COD, shorter reaction time and lower current density. The average current efficiency was found as low as 13 % and as high as 777 %. Overall, the study showed that hybrid electrochemical oxidation can be applied effectively and efficiently for the removal of pollutants from healthcare wastewater.

AB In this work, a highly effective catalyst (MoO3) is synthesized and applied for catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. The catalyst is systematically characterized to investigate the morphology, crystal structure and chemical composition, and the findings demostrated that MoO3 catalyst is successfully synthesized. The degradation mechanism is also illustrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The degradation experiments confirm that MoO, catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance in CWAO, and the removal rate of TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) is achieved to more than 93%. The catalyst doses, reaction temperature and reaction time have a significant impact on the removal of pollutants. The degradation process of pollutants in CWAO could be satisfactorily fitted by the second-order kinetics. Besides, MoO3 displays a favorable stability as CWAO catalyst. DFT calculation illustrates that MoO3 catalyst is a typical indirect band gap semiconductor. Moreover, the high temperature environment provides the thermal excitation energy, which favors to the free electrons nearing Fermi level to escape the material surface, and excites them to the conduction band, then directly reduces the pollutants in CWAO. These findings demonstrate that MoO3 can be used as an efficient and excellent catalyst for CWAO of pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical industry has grown tremendously in the last few decades. As such, literature on the treatment of this wastewater is scarce. Water pollution control problems in the developing countries need to be solved through application of cost effective aerobic/anaerobic biological systems. One such system-the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process which is known to be cost effective and where by-product recovery was also feasible was applied for treatment of a high strength wastewater for a period of six months in a pilot scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor with a capacity of 27.44 m(3). Studies were carried out at various organic loading rates varying between 6.26 and 10.33 kg COD/m(3)/day and hydraulic retention time (HRT) fluctuating between 33 and 43 hours. This resulted in chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) removal in the range of 86.2%-91.6%, 90.0%-95.2% and 62.6%-68.0% respectively. The biogas production varied between 0.32-0.47 m(3)/kg COD added. Sludge from different heights of UASB reactor was collected and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated good granulation with efficient UASB reactor performance.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment is a rapidly emerging international issue A variety of drugs have been found in sewage effluents and surface waters in Europe, the United States, and Canada This study examines the presence of selected pharmaceuticals (8 acidic drugs) and the antimicrobial substance, triclosan, in raw water and finished water of drinking water plants across southern Ontario Twenty drinking water treatment plants that represented a variety of water sources and treatment process parameters were sampled None of the raw or finished water samples taken from wells showed detectable levels of any of the acidic drugs or triclosan River water samples downstream of sewage effluent outfalls showed the highest levels of contamination of the source water Levels of naproxen and Ibuprofen were elevated to levels as high as 176 and 150 ng/L, respectively, in raw water entering the treatment plants from a river source Low levels of gemfibrozil (19 2 ng/L), diclofenac (15 ng/L), indomethacin (6 ng/L), and the antimicrobial triclosan (34 ng/L) could be also detected in raw water from river sources Raw water taken from large lakes also had very low but detectable levels of several acidic drugs, suggesting that these chemicals are widespread in the environment Although treatment systems are not designed to remove these specific types of substances, most of the acidic drugs were not detectable in finished waters Naproxen and triclosan were detectable in finished water but were significantly reduced in concentration relative to the raw water The concentration of ibuprofen was detectable in the finished water of almost all treatment plants that used surface water as a source This work demonstrates the potential of Ontario source waters, particularly river water sources, to contain trace levels of selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products There is a need to complete a more comprehensive assessment of these compounds in source waters and of the factors influencing their treatment and removal from finished drinking water

AB In recent decades the Yinma River Basin has been receiving increasing pollution from industrial and domestic wastewater, agriculture, and livestock production - which are all potential 4-NP pollution sources. Thus, this work investigated spatial-seasonal distribution, risks, and seasonal variations of 4-nonylphenol in the aquatic environment of the Yinma River Basin. The results indicated that the highest concentrations in water and sediment occurred in livestock-production, industrial, and domestic-wastewater areas, and the lowest occurred in agricultural areas; a seasonal variation in 4-NP concentrations in water was observed, with the highest concentrations occurring in the dry season and the lowest concentrations in the wet season. The results for risk quotient indicated that in three water seasons, low ecological risks of 4-NP in water primarily occurred in agricultural areas, and high ecological risks occurred downstream of domestic-wastewater drainage; the ecological risks of 4-NP in sediment from all the sampling sites were exposed to moderate or high ecological risks. Based on the results for hazard quotient, a seasonal variation in human health risks of 4-NP in water was observed; except for a sampling site located downstream of domestic wastewater drainage, human health risks of 4-NP in water were low.

AB Activated carbon processes, initially designed for drinking water production, are tested for wastewater application in order to characterize their efficiency to remove micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharges. In that purpose, a pilot was studied by the Paris sanitation service (SIAAP) and the water environment and urban systems laboratory (LEESU). The in-situ study raised several additional questions related to the structural and morphological properties of activated carbons, in order to select the proper material, the influence of operational parameters such as the activated carbon dose and the contact time, the role of organic matter concentration and composition, the presence of a residual concentration of methanol or the impact of ferric chloride addition. Thus, various complementary experiments were carried out at laboratory scale to improve the understanding of the micropollutants adsorption process on activated carbon, in particular on powdered activated carbon (PAC).
   The results have highlighted a strong link between the efficiency of PACs and their specific surface (BET), which can be easily estimated by their bulk density. The study of the sorption process has also confirmed the strong influence of the PAC dose and the rapidity of the sorption kinetic. From an operational point of view, the ferric chloride injection seems to slightly improve most of the detected compounds adsorption, probably thanks to the coagulation of the dissolved organic matter colloidal fraction. In contrary, the presence in the water of a residual concentration of methanol seems to have no impact on the micropollutant fate. The influence of the wastewater matrix is strong, with notably lower adsorption in water from primary settling compared to various WWTP discharges. However, the dissolved organic carbon concentration is not always sufficient to explain sorption competitions in wastewater, and the nature of the organic matter should be considered too. In particular, the carbon removal from biological treatments is the step that clearly modifies both the quantity and the composition of the organic matter. It has been observed that discharges from WWTPs operating with different biological processes (activated sludge, membrane bioreactor or biofiltration) have similar organic matter concentrations and compositions, and allows comparable removals of organic matter and micropollutants by adsorption. The lower performances on micropollutants observed in the settled water can be explained by the higher quantity of protein-like molecules (fluorophores I delta and I gamma), which compose the most competitive organic matter fraction for adsorption on activated carbon, compared to the other waters.

AB The elimination of organic micropollutants (OMPs) from wastewater could in future become mandatory for operators of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Indicator substances are a great help and a cost-efficient way in monitoring the pollution of water bodies with OMPs caused by the discharge of WWTPs. However, with the still increasing number of OMPs in our environment, the selection of suitable indicator substances presents a challenge. A concept was developed to help identify representative indicator substances. The derived indicator substances are not only used to assess water pollution, but can also be used to calculate elimination efficiencies of WWTPs. In the present investigations, the indicator substances were used to evaluate the reduction of OMPs in the water body on the basis of the expansion of a WWTP with an ozonation plant. The transferability of the tool was verified with a second WWTP. Furthermore, the impact of the number of measurements was analysed via statistical combinatorics. With the tool, 36 substances were classified, leading to the identification of 9 suggested indicator substances. Among them ibuprofen and diclofenac attracted attention due to their ecotoxicological relevance. Detailed data analyses were carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) and loads.

AB The increasing reuse of wastewater for irrigation introduces surfactants and antibiotics into the environment. How these two kinds of compounds interact with regard to their sorption processes in soil is not clear.
   We performed batch experiments to investigate the sorption of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and its effect on sorption of sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin in irrigated and non-irrigated soils with different organic matter (OM) contents.
   LAS sorption was non-linear in the presence of the antibiotics, and as general trend, it increased with rising OM content of soils. Free LAS was also removed from solution by complexation with Ca2+. Dissolved organic compounds released from soils with OM contents aeyen18.4 g kg(-1) further reduced LAS sorption. Sorption of sulfamethoxazole was reduced by LAS sorption only in one soil with a small OM content of 9.5 g kg(-1).
   The strong sorption of ciprofloxacin is not affected by LAS. Sulfamethoxazole sorption only competes with LAS sorption in organic matter-poor soils. Accumulation of organic matter in soils, for example due to long-term wastewater irrigation, provides extra sorption capacity for LAS and sulfamethoxazole so that competition for sorption sites is reduced.

AB The occurrence of five acidic pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and bezafibrate, in seven different sewage treatment plants (STP) and three receiving waters were determined. The analytical procedure included solid phase extraction, liquid chromatographic separation and detection by a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The studied pharmaceuticals were found in all the STPs. The pattern of the occurrence of individual compounds was the same in every STP and matched the consumption figures reported in the literature. Ibuprofen is the most used pharmaceutical in Finland and was accordingly found to be the most abundant compound in the raw sewage. In the treatment processes, the highest removal rate was observed for ibuprofen and the lowest for diclofenac, 92% +/- 8% and 26% +/- 17%, respectively. Due to the incomplete removal in the STPs, the pharmaceuticals were found in rivers at the discharge points of the STP effluents. Downstream from the discharge points, the concentrations decreased significantly mainly due to dilution in the river water. The risk to the aquatic environment was estimated by a ratio of measured environmental concentration (MEC) and predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). At the concentrations the compounds were found in the surface waters, they should not pose risk for the aquatic environment. However, at dry seasons and/or during malfunctions of STPs, ibuprofen could be associated with a risk in small river systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation products (OPs)formed during ozonation of metoprolol were identified via liquid chromatography and hybride Qq LIT-MS. Experiments carried out at pH 3 and 8 showed the formation of different OPs, depending on pH. The analysis of samples with and without tertiary butanol (t-BuOH) revealed the influence of OH radical reactions. The OH radical exposure was measured by adding a probe compound (para-chlorobenzoic acid, pCBA). Elucidation of chemical structures confirmed the formation of aldehyde moieties as well as the occurrence of hydroxylation reactions. Several reaction pathways for the formation of the oxidation products are proposed. Analysis of ozonated raw wastewater and the effluent of a Municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with 10 mu M metoprolol exhibited a similar OP formation pattern as detected in the reaction system at pH 8 without a radical scavenger. This indicates a significant impact of OH radical exposure on the formation of OPs in real wastewater matrices.

AB The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical and baker's yeast industry effluents in a joint treatment system. Anaerobic treatability studies have been performed in a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBR). The experimental study has been carried out for 333 days. The influent COD's during the experimental study were about 10,000 mg/l. Pharmaceutical wastewater has a 5% of inhibition on the COD removals at the dilution rate of 1/100 or more in the joint anaerobic treatment with baker's yeast industry effluents. Maximum inhibition of 10% on the average was observed when the system was characterized with acclimation periods. The study has shown that, following the solvent extraction with pre-aeration process, a common anaerobic treatment can be applied to baker's yeast industry wastewater and to pharmaceutical industry effluents.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the performance of mixed microalgal bioreactors in treating three different types of wastewaters-kitchen wastewater (KWW), palm oil mill effluent (POME), and pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) in semi-continuous mode and to analyze the lipid content in the harvested algal biomass. The reactors were monitored for total nitrogen and phosphate removal at eight solid retention times (SRTs): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days. The nutrient uptake kinetic parameters were quantified using linearized Michaelis-Menten and Monod models at steady-state conditions. The nutrient removal efficiency and lipid production were found to be higher in KWW when compared with the other wastewaters. Saturated fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1) accounted for more than 60% of the algal fatty acids for all the wastewaters. The lipid is, therefore, considered suitable for synthesizing biodiesel.

AB Due to the wide use, bisphenol A (BPA) has been detected frequently in the aquatic environment. However, the information on the distribution of BPA transformation products is limited. In this study, we investigated two BPA transformation products, namely bisphenol A monomethyl ether (BPA-MME) and bisphenol A dimethyl ether (BPA-DME). This study revealed that both transformation products were widely detected in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as in surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary with higher detected concentrations and detection frequencies for BPA-DME. Temporal variations were observed in a WWTP based on a five-year sampling campaign. Mass load of BPA and its transformation products was evaluated and results indicated the generation of BPA-MME and BPA-DME during the wastewater treatment processes, which contributed for 1.95% BPA removal. BPA and its transformation products were also widely detected in the surface water of Jiulong River and its estuary. Results indicated their additional generation in the surface water, since BPA-MME and BPA-DME in the surface river water were with similar level or even higher than effluent in WWTPs.

AB An analytical method for the determination of eight pharmaceutical compounds in waters has been developed and validated. Target compounds included hormones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, P-blockers and psychiatric drugs. The analytical determination has been achieved through off-line solid phase extraction and analysis in liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. For the determination of the hormones, samples were also derivatized with 1,2-dimethylim-idazole-4-sulfonyl-chloride. The limits of detection of the drugs varied between 0.01 and 30 ng/L, according to the limits indicated by the European Commission. For each compound, the six-point calibration curves showed excellent linearity (r2 >= 0.995) and the inter-session repeatability for all compounds ranged from 1 to 10%. This method was also applied for the determination of the target pharmaceuticals in the influent and the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in order to assess their presence and their removal inside the plant. Every compound, except for 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, has been found in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant and none of them, except for acetaminophen, were removed within the plant.

AB Although ternary chalcogenide compounds are effective photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation, their photocatalytic activity and stability are still low and far from practical application. In this study, two-dimensional AgInS2/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions were fabricated by one-step hydrothermal method. AgIn52/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions have strong visible-light absorption and narrow band gap of 2.27-2.35 eV, and exhibit excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity in the degradation of 2-nitrophenol (2NP) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC.HCl) compared with pure AgInS2 and pure SnIn4S8, which is attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The practical application of AgInS2/SnIn4S8 nanosheet heterojunctions was further studied. 20 mg AgInS2/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions can effectively treat 100 mL real pharmaceutical industry wastewater in presence of H2O2 with 65.98% mineralization efficiency, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of pharmaceutical industry wastewater decreases to 153 mg/L, which meets the discharge standards of industrial effluent. Moreover, AgInS2/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions can maintain long-term activity without obvious inactivation after five consecutive catalytic cycles without using regeneration means.

AB The fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater treatment systems is an area of increasing concern. Little research has been done to understand this issue in rural or decentralized communities. The objective of this research was to examine the ability of a bench scale nitrifying recirculating biofilter (RBF) to remove four acidic PhACs: gemfibrozil, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from secondary treated municipal wastewater at concentrations of 20 and 200 mu g/L. The average removals in this study were between 92 and 99% for ibuprofen, 89 and 99% for naproxen, 62 and 92% for gemfibrozil and 40 and 76% for diclofenac, which is consistent with literature. Ibuprofen and naproxen were largely removed through biological transformation; whereas gemfibrozil and diclofenac showed more variable removal, likely due to both biological transformation and sorption processes. PhAC removal in the RBFs was repeatable between trials, robust and responsive to system upsets, and the presence of PhACs as a single compound versus mixtures had no impact on PhAC removal efficiency. In summary, this study indicates that RBFs as a nitrifying stage of a multi-stage filtration process could be a viable technology for removal of some acidic pharmaceuticals in small onsite wastewater treatment facilities.

AB Paper mills generate varieties of pollutants depending upon the type of the production process. Raw and biologically treated effluents from two paper mills with different production processes and different biological treatment plants were analysed by COD, BOD5, AOX as well as by phthalates, bisphenol A, and nonylphenol which are potential endocrine disrupting compounds. Removal efficiency of aerobic and combined aerobic/anaerobic wastewater treatment plants were studied for investigated compounds. The results indicated that dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bisphenol A, and nonylphenol were present in raw and biologically treated paper mill effluents. The removal efficiencies of aerobic and combined aerobicanaerobic biological wastewater treatment plants were 87% and 87% for dimethyl phthalate, 79% and 91% for diethyl phthalate, 73% and 88% for dibutyl phthalate, 84% and 78% for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 86% and 76% for benzyl butyl phthalate, 74% and 79% for bisphenol A, and 71% and 81% for nonylphenol, respectively. Despite relative high removal efficiency of biological wastewater treatment plants for investigated compounds, the concentrations of nonylphenol in treated paper mill effluents exceeded limits of 0.3 mu g/L according to Directive (2008/105/EC).

AB A set of three benzotriazole corrosion inhibitors was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in wastewaters and in a partially closed water cycle in the Berlin region. Benzotriazole (BTri) and two isomers of tolyltriazole (TTri) were determined in untreated municipal wastewater with mean dissolved concentrations of 12 mu g/L (BTri), 2.1 mu g/L (4-TTri), and 1.3 mu g/L (5-TTri). Removal in conventional activated sludge (CAS) municipal wastewater treatment ranged from 37% for BTri to insignificant removal for 4-TTri. In laboratory batch tests 5-TTri was mineralized completely and 4-TTri was mineralized to only 25%. This different behavior of the three benzotriazoles was confirmed by following the triazoles through a partially closed water cycle, into bank filtrate used for drinking water production, where BTri (0.1 mu g/L) and 4-TTri (0.03 mu g/L) but no 5-TTri were detected after a travel time of several months. The environmental half-life appears to increase from 5-TTri over BTri to 4-TTri. Treatment of municipal wastewater by a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) instead of CAS improved the removal of BTri and 5-TTri but could not avoid their discharge.

AB Drug disposal programs have been seen as a remedy to the concern of environmental contamination resulting from pharmaceutical disposal down the toilet or sink; however a thorough review of peer-reviewed literature and publicly available information on these programs indicates limited research has been conducted to validate the effectiveness of these programs at reducing pharmaceuticals in the environment. The purpose of this research was to determine if drug disposal programs could actually reduce pharmaceutical residues in the environment. The concentration of hydrocodone in wastewater effluent released from a wastewater treatment plant in Denton, Texas was monitored before and after a take back program called Denton Drug Disposal Day (D4). Data collected and analyzed suggests D4 events were successful in contributing to a reduction of pharmaceutical loading to the environment; however there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that D4 events were exclusively responsible for these improvements.

TI Degradation of Organic Carbon in Pharmaceutical Wastewater: a Kinetic

SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article

   Photo-Fenton
AB This study aimed to investigate the degradation kinetics of the total organic carbon (TOC) in real pharmaceutical wastewater. Because of the complexity of real wastewaters and the lack of knowledge on all reactions involved in their chemical degradation, the use of a kinetic approach becomes difficult. To overcome this difficulty, we adopted a kinetic model based on chemical equations validated for mechanisms of free radical generation. Photo-Fenton reactions were performed in a 1-L tubular reactor. The developed model satisfactorily described the degradation kinetics of TOC in wastewater, with an R-2 of 0.9997. The TOC degradation rate constant (k(d)) was estimated at 1 x 10(11) L-2 mol(2) s(-1), in agreement with literature values for the degradation kinetics of organic compounds. UV radiation had a positive effect on degradation, contributing to HO center dot formation. The adopted mathematical approach was highly sensitive to the formation rate constant of HO center dot from H2O2 (k(4)). By assuming the reaction to follow variable order kinetics (beta = 1 and beta = 2), it was possible to improve the goodness of fit of the model. Our results suggest, albeit in an incipient way, that the approach used in this study can be extended to the kinetic understanding of other complex wastewaters.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a potent carcinogen associated with chloramination of wastewater and wastewater impacted drinking waters. Substantial effort has been expended to identify the precursors and mechanisms leading to NDMA formation. One of the major discoveries has been that molecules in the N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamine class, including the common pharmaceutical ranitidine, form NDMA in high yield during chloramination. Simultaneously, it was hypothesized that these precursors react with monochloramine, the dominant species in most chloramine mixtures, to form NDMA. This monochloramine hypothesis contradicts past mechanistic work with simple secondary amines, as well as practical experience showing that minimization dichloramine reduces the level of NDMA formation during wastewater reuse and drinking water treatment. In this work, we address the contradiction between practical experience and model precursor studies by showing that N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamines form NDMA chiefly via reactions with dichloramine, rather than monochloramine. We experimentally demonstrate substantially higher NDMA yields from dichloramination than from monochloramination of four N,N-dimethyl-alpha-arylamine compounds, including ranitidine, and computationally rationalize declining NDMA yields at large dichloramine doses, which may explain past results reporting low NDMA yields from dichloramination of ranitidine. These results provide support for NDMA control strategies currently under evaluation at wastewater reuse facilities.

AB This study examined the evolution of absorbance spectra of wastewater ozonated using varying initial ozone concentrations or treatment times, concomitant changes of concentrations of trace-level pharmaceuticals were also quantified The absorbance of ozonated wastewater decreased due to the degradation of chromophores in effluent organic matter (EfOM) The relative decrease of absorbance (Delta A/A(0)) ranged from <30% for lambda < 250 nm to >80% for lambda > 320 nm. The removal of atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, iopromide, naproxen, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and p-chlorobenzoic acid was strongly correlated with Delta A/A(0) values The observed features were hypothesized to correspond to the engagement of kinetically distinct groups of EfOM chromophores Modeling of the evolution of EfOM absorbance and concurrent degradation of trace-level organic species based on this hypothesis confirmed its applicability and utility for practical applications and theoretical exploration

AB The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater effluents is recognized as the main factor limiting the adsorption of organic micropollutants (OMPs) onto activated carbon. The degree of the negative effect that DOM, depending on its quality, exerts on OMPs adsorption is still unclear. The influence of the interactions between DOM and OMPs on their removal is also not fully understood. Adsorption isotherms and conventional batch tests were performed in ultra-pure water and in wastewater effluent to study the influence of DOM on the adsorption of 12 OMPs onto powdered activated carbon. Best fit of adsorption pseudo-isotherms was obtained with the Freundlich equation and showed, as expected, that OMPs adsorption was higher in ultra-pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of DOM leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites. LC-OCD analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the most adsorbed fractions while humic acids were not removed after a contact time of either 30 min or 72 h. The presence of DOM had a negative impact on the removal of all OMPs after 30 min of adsorption, but similar removals to ultra-pure water were obtained for 6 OMPs after 72 h of adsorption. This demonstrated that competition between DOM and OMPs for adsorption sites was not a major mechanism as compared to pore blockage, which only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it. The charge of OMPs had a clear impact: the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was reduced in the presence of wastewater effluent due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed DOM and the PAC surface. On the other hand, the removal of positively charged compounds was improved. A 24 h pre-equilibrium between OMPs and DOM improved their removal onto PAC, which suggest that OMPs and DOM interacted in solution which decreased the negative effects caused by the presence of DOM, e.g. through co-adsorption of an OMP-DOM complex.

The compounds were extracted from water samples using Oasis HLB cartridges. The analytes were then identified and quantified using LC-MS/MS with dual-polarity electrospray ionisation in the MRM mode. Good linearity was obtained for all tested compounds (R-2 > 0.99). The limits of detection (LODs) ranged between 0.15 and 24.0 ng l(-1). Spike recoveries ranged from 84 to 115% and from 81 to 117% for urban wastewater and surface water samples, respectively, with satisfactory precision (RSD <20%). Finally, the method was used to analyse real effluent and surface water.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in the chemical concentration of interstitial water in the vadose zone was previously observed under apparently homogeneous surface conditions on two leveled fields sprinkler irrigated with treated sewage effluents on the phreatic Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel. This phenomenon greatly hampers the monitoring of groundwater quality. In this study we report on the presence of puddles of different size and shape that were sporadically observed in these fields. Temporal variability noted in the concentration of treated sewage effluents components in the puddles were considered to be related to evapotranspiration and degradation. For example: increases in the electrical conductivity (up to 1.32 mS/cm), and in the concentrations of chloride (up to 521 mg/L), dissolved organic carbon (up to 28.4 mg/L), and carbamazepine (up to 780 ng/L) and decreases in the concentrations of nitrate (up to 20.1 mg/L) and caffeine (3396 ng/L). Variable trends in concentration were observed for sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine and o-desmethylvenlafaxine. The presence of puddles was not necessarily related to areas with high irrigation water input. It is postulated that the continuous chemical variability in the puddles, whose location and size are also variable, determine a heterogeneous influx of solutes into the soil and subsequently into the vadose zone.

AB In this study, laboratory scale experiments were conducted to investigate the nitrogen removal from pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater. The results indicate that by selective inhibition of free ammonia on oxidizers, nitrogen removal can be achieved by nitritation and denitritation process. The nitrite ratio was above 98% in the aerobic stage and the nitrogen removal efficiency was about 99%. The complete ammonia removal corresponded exactly to the "Ammonia Valley" in the pH versus time graphic and the anoxic reaction was completed when the "Nitrite Knee" appeared in the ORP versus time graphic. Optimization of the SBR cycle by step-feed and on-line control with pH and ORP strategy allowed the carbon and energy saving. The easy operation and the low cost make the SBR system an interesting option for the biological nitrogen removal from the pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater.

AB Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fiuoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herbal pharmaceutical wastewater possesses high chemical oxygen demand (COD) (21,960-26,000 mg/l) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (11,200-15,660 mg/l) and suspended solids (SS) (5,460-7,370 mg/l). It cannot be directly discharged into surface water bodies, due to its highly biodegradable nature. Herbal pharmaceutical wastewater has been treated by using vermifilter, which is an ecosystem consisting of biosoil with bacteria and earthworms producing vermicastings. In the present studies a cost-effective, eco-friendly and sustainable method has been applied for the treatment of herbal pharmaceutical wastewater using earthworms. Studies were carried out at different organic loadings, ranging between 0.8 and 3.2 kg COD/m(3)day at three different hydraulic loadings of 1, 2 and 4 days. Vermifilters packed with 1:1:1 ratio of soil, sand and vermicast as media matrix along with the twenty adult earthworms in each reactor was used for the experiments. Treated effluent was colour and odour free. Efficient COD/BOD removals in the range of 85.44%-94.48% and 89.77%-96.26% were obtained respectively at 2 days hydraulic retention time (HRT). Heavy metal removals were also observed and no sludge production problem was encountered, only nutrient rich vermicast from the filters were removed and analysed after the experiments. It showed higher manurial value than control in terms of available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) and were in the range of 178.75-278.75 Kg/hectare available nitrogen, 16.128-50.4 kg/hectare of available phosphorus and 19.3-28.6 kg/hectare of available potassium at maximum HRT and at different organic loadings. This paper discusses in detail the feasibility of vermifilters in herbal pharmaceutical wastewater treatment at different organic and hydraulic loadings.

AB The mechanisms and reaction pathway of UV photo-assisted Fenton-like degradation of progesterone in water and wastewater were investigated. The reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics for both the dark Fenton-like and UV photo-Fenton-like processes. The reaction kinetics of the UV photo-assisted process improved with the presence of humic acid (HA) in wastewater, due to the formation of Fe(III)-HA complexes which enhanced Fe(II) production by a ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The UV photo-assisted process reduced the amount of ferric required to completely degrade progesterone by 60 % and lowered the activation energy to 42 kJ/mol compared to 104 kJ/mol for the dark Fenton-like process. Complete degradation of progesterone was achieved through a multi-step process involving several intermediate compounds.

Then, RHB characterized by various techniques including Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. RHB used for the removal and adsorption of toluene from pharmaceutical wastewater. Toluene adsorption profile displayed an initial fast toluene uptake that reduced and reach equilibrium after two hours contact time at which up to 90 % toluene was taken by RHB from water. Kinetic data well fitted by using pseudo-second order models (R-2= 0.99), which representing that chemisorption mechanism. Langmuir equation fitted well equilibrium data at all RHB dosage and maximum adsorption capacity was 108 mg/g. These findings suggest that the RHB is efficient toluene adsorbent and it possess good potential for toluene removal in wastewater treatment.

AB The yeast toxicity test (YTT), based on the inhibition of saccharose fermentation by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was evaluated using standard toxicants (copper sulphate, formaldehyde, sodium nitrite, sodium sulphite, phenol and zinc sulphate). Repeated measurements of YTT accuracy with the standard toxicants showed EC50 values characterized by low standard deviation and coefficient of variation (7.62%). Moreover, the YTT was compared to standard prokaryotic biotests by estimating the toxicity of wastewater from pharmaceutical sources. The toxicity of wastewaters measured by YTT agrees sufficiently with those measured by standard methods of the determination of toxicity such as inhibition of bioluminescence, TTC-dehydrogenase activity, aerobic bacterial growth and anaerobic sludge biogas production. The YTT is a rapid, simple, reliable, sensitive and cost-effective method for presumptive estimations of the toxicity of wastewaters, which could be performed in laboratory as well as in field conditions.

AB Health care facilities can represent point sources for pharmaceutical residues in public sewer systems. Compared to general hospitals, more specialized health care facilities might also have a different pattern of medication. Therefore, the on-site treatment of wastewater fromsuch facilities could be an effective strategy to reduce emissions into water bodies and was the aim of this study. Wastewater from three health care facilities (nursing home, clinicwith orthopaedic focus, and psychiatric clinic) was treated in lab-scale and semi-industrial trials. Biological treatment was performed via an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor (UF-MBR), after which adsorption onto granular activated carbon (using rapid-small-scale column tests GAC-RSSCT), ozonation and a UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) were tested and compared. The removal of 17 pharmaceutical compounds and drug metabolites from 9 drug classes (e.g. analgesics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants) was evaluated. Most of the measured OMP were detected with concentrations between 1,000 and 30,000 ng L-1 in the influent of the MBR. The UF-MBR provided an effective mechanical-biological cleaning of the wastewater, with micropollutant removal efficiencies between 0 and > 95%, making further treatment necessary to remove the micropollutants. Each combination of the UF-MBR with one of the three further treatments achieved removal efficiencies above 80% for most of the investigated substances, reducing many to below the quantification limit of 10 ng L-1. The results show the general suitability of combining the UF-MBR with either GAC-adsorption, ozonation or AOP for eliminating pharmaceutical residues. However, the AOP process has a significantly higher energy demand than the other two processes. Moreover, specific settings and dosages depend on the respective wastewater matrix.

AB Human excreta are potential sources of plant nutrients, but are today usually considered a waste to be disposed of. The requirements on wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove nitrogen and phosphorus are increasing and to meet these requirements, more energy and chemicals are needed by WWTPs. Separating the nutrient-rich wastewater fractions at source and recycling them to agriculture as fertiliser is an alternative to removing them at the WWTP. This study used life cycle assessment methodology to compare the environmental impact of different scenarios for recycling the nutrients in the human excreta as fertiliser to arable land or removing them in an advanced WWTP. Three scenarios were assessed. In blackwater scenario, blackwater was source-separated and used as fertiliser. In urine scenario, the urine fraction was source-separated and used as fertiliser and the faecal water treated in an advanced WWTP. In NP scenario, chemical fertiliser was used as fertiliser and the toilet water treated in an advanced WWTP. The emissions from the WWTP were the same for all scenarios. This was fulfilled by the enhanced reduction in the WWTP fully removing the nutrients from the excreta that were not source-separated in the NP and urine scenarios. Recycling source-separated wastewater fractions as fertilisers in agriculture proved efficient for conserving energy and decreasing global warming potential (GWP). However, the blackwater and urine scenarios had a higher impact on potential eutrophication and potential acidification than the WWTP-chemical fertiliser scenario, due to large impacts by the ammonia emitted from storage and after spreading of the fertilisers. The cadmium input to the arable soil was very small with urine fertiliser. Source separation and recycling of excreta fractions as fertiliser thus has potential for saving energy and decreasing GWP emissions associated with wastewater management. However, for improved sustainability, the emissions from storage and after spreading of these fertilisers must decrease. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The applicability of any wastewater technology should be related not only to its degradation, mineralization or detoxification efficiency, but also to its environmental impacts. This could be particularly relevant in case of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are usually highly demanding on chemicals, energy, and generating residual fluxes with specific problems and potential environmental impacts (metal ion-containing sludge, exhausted solid catalysts, etc). In this work, the life cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied for the evaluation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes for the treatment of a wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical industry in Toledo, Spain. The application of LCA as tool for the evaluation of AOPs is scarce found in literature, although it provides a systematic estimation of the environmental changes related to the AOP treatment, quantification of consumptions and emissions, and their effects on human health. In this work, the potential environmental impacts were calculated with Gabi 6.0 software by using ReCiPe version 1.06 and ICCP 2007 methods. Additionally, the water footprint (WF) was used in this study for the first time as tool for comparison between both AOP systems. Experimental data, directly obtained from the company and the laboratory were used to carry out the life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, ensuring high accuracy and sensitivity of the obtained results. The obtained results showed that the recovery of the metallic sludge generated in the homogeneous Fenton process is the most contributing step to environmental impacts followed by the use of chemicals and the heat requirements. The comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous Fenton processes revealed that the latter is a more environmental friendly alternative for the treatment of the pharmaceutical wastewater. In addition, the use of the heterogeneous process allows the reduction of the water footprint in more than 77% as compared to the homogeneous one. Besides the results regarding to both Fenton processes, this work shows the efficiency of the water footprint as a complementary parameter to the LCA for comparison between advanced wastewater treatments processes which can be intensive use of fresh water as a resource.

AB Three sulfonamides - para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), ortho-toluenesulfonamide (o-TSA) and benzenesulfonamide (BSA) - have recently been detected in groundwater within a catchment area of one drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), which is located downstream of a former sewage farm. The degradation pathways of p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA were investigated during drinking water treatment with incubation experiments and an experimental filter. Incubation experiments showed that p-TSA is removed during the treatment by microbiological processes. Removal of p-TSA is performed by adapted microorganisms only present in polluted groundwater. The elimination in an experimental filter of 1.6 m length applying filtration velocities from 2 to 6 m h(-1) was similar to 93% of p-TSA. The microbial degradation rates in the incubation experiment were similar to 0.029 mu g l(-1) h(-1) (zero order reaction). In the experimental filter, the reaction rate constants were around 0.0063 s(-1) for all filtration velocities (1 st order reaction). Drinking water treatment does not reduce the concentration of o-TSA and BSA under conditions encountered in Berlin. p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA were only measured in the low mu g l(-1) concentrations range in the purified water.

AB The study is motivated by the industrial problem from pharmaceutical industry, which is ethanol and methanol removal from process wastewater. To complete this goal hybrid method is investigated and optimized. Two distillation columns are sufficient for separation of alcohol-water mixture. Suitable water can be purified as bottom product of first column. Ethanol and methanol purification is achieved with combination of second distillation column and pervaporation. The target of this research is to rigorously model and optimize the separation of water-ethanol-methanol ternary mixture in professional flowsheet simulator environment. The minimal sufficient membrane transfers area and number of minimal theoretical stages of the columns are determined. Cost estimation is also investigated according to Douglas methodology. Considering the simulation and economic results it can be determined that, the hybrid configuration is suitable for separation of ternary mixture in 99.5 weight percent purity.

AB Octahedral CdS/SnIn4S8 nano-heterojunctions were fabricated by a facile and simple one-step in situ hydrothermal method, and the molar ratio of CdS to SnIn4S8 was optimized. The optimal (0.5:1)CdS/SnIn4S8 heterojunctions exhibit the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity with 97.1% degradation efficiency of 2-nitrophenol in 120 min, which is much higher than those of individual CdS and SnIn4S8. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charges originating from the well-matched band gap structures. Of special significance is that (0.5:1)CdS/SnIn4S8 can effectively mineralize 2-nitrophenol and real pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, CdS/SnIn4S8 nano-heterojunctions show excellent reusability in five cycles due to the stable surface composition and chemical valence state. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater using chemical processes is a promising solution to mitigate pollution in drinking and surface waters. Non-catalytic wet air oxidation (WAO) is a highly efficient advanced oxidation process that uses air and water at high temperatures and pressures to remove high concentrations of organic compounds from various wastes without use of catalysts. However, the elimination of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater with a low organic content by WAO has not yet been sufficiently studied. The objective of the present study was to evaluate both the efficiency and costs of WAO treatment to remove pharmaceuticals present in hospital effluents. First, a laboratory-scale WAO batch unit was used to optimize oxidation temperatures and residence times to achieve high elimination of ten pharmaceuticals of interest in spiked deionized water. Then, optimal conditions were applied to treat hospital wastewater effluents. Results showed that even at low chemical oxygen demand values (<600 mg O-2 per L), WAO at 290 degrees C with 15 min residence time removed between 95.0% and 99.1% of the target compounds spiked at 10 mu g L-1 in hospital wastewater. Acute toxicity bioassays using the crustacean Daphnia magna and the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri showed that the toxicity of hospital wastewater increased after WAO treatment due to the generation of transformation products. However, since the intended use of WAO is as pretreatment for hospital effluents before municipal water treatment, it is not yet clear if WAO treated effluents could affect bacteria in activated sludge. The study included a techno-economic analysis to evaluate capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of an industrial-scale WAO unit to remove pharmaceuticals from the wastewater effluent of a local hospital. This analysis demonstrated that CAPEX for an 86 L min(-1) WAO industrial-scale unit was $ 2.35m (in Canadian dollars), while OPEX was $ 1.09m, which corresponds to a relative price of $ 27 per m(3). Initial investment for the WAO unit might be reduced by up to 44% by employing a preconcentration unit to increase the effluents' chemical oxygen demand in smaller volumes which could also make the process autothermal while reducing WAO's operating expenses by more than 20%.

AB This paper compares the removal performances of two complete wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for all priority substances listed in the Water Framework Directive and additional compounds of interest including flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides, and personal care products (PCPs) (n = 104). First, primary treatments such as physicochemical lamellar settling (PCLS) and primary settling (PS) are compared. Similarly, biofiltration (BF) and conventional activated sludge (CAS) are then examined. Finally, the removal efficiency per unit of nitrogen removed of both WWTPs for micropollutants is discussed, as nitrogenous pollution treatment results in a special design of processes and operational conditions. For primary treatments, hydrophobic pollutants (log K (ow) > 4) are well removed (> 70 %) for both systems despite high variations of removal. PCLS allows an obvious gain of about 20 % regarding pollutant removals, as a result of better suspended solids elimination and possible coagulant impact on soluble compounds. For biological treatments, variations of removal are much weaker, and the majority of pollutants are comparably removed within both systems. Hydrophobic and volatile compounds are well (> 60 %) or very well removed (> 80 %) by sorption and volatilization. Some readily biodegradable molecules are better removed by CAS, indicating a better biodegradation. A better sorption of pollutants on activated sludge could be also expected considering the differences of characteristics between a biofilm and flocs. Finally, comparison of global processes efficiency using removals of micropollutants load normalized to nitrogen shows that PCLS + BF is as efficient as PS + CAS despite a higher compactness and a shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT). Only some groups of pollutants seem better removed by PS + CAS like alkylphenols, flame retardants, or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), thanks to better biodegradation and sorption resulting from HRT and biomass characteristics. For both processes, and out of the 68 molecules found in raw water, only half of them are still detected in the water discharged, most of the time close to their detection limit. However, some of them are detected at higher concentrations (> 1 mu g/L and/or lower than environmental quality standards), which is problematic as they represent a threat for aquatic environment.

AB In this study we analyzed and characterized 29 psychoactive remedies, illicit drugs and their metabolites in single stages of wastewater treatment plants in the capital city of Slovakia. Psychoactive compounds were present within all stages, and tramadol was detected at a very high concentration (706 ng/L). Significant decreases of codeine, THC-COOH, cocaine and buprenorphine concentration were observed in the biological stage. Consequently, we were interested in the possibility of alternative tertiary post-treatment of effluent water with the following aquatic plants: Cabomba caroliniana, Limnophila sessiliflora, Egeria najas and Iris pseudacorus. The most effective plant for tertiary cleansing was I. pseudacorus which demonstrated the best pharmaceutical removal capacity. After 48 h codeine and citalopram was removed with 87% efficiency. After 96 h were all analyzed compounds were eliminated with efficiencies above 58%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of estrogenic chemicals during wastewater reclamation has been a great concern. Current advanced treatment processes are inefficient for the removal of estrogenic chemicals from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to the coexistence of other pollutants with less environmental significance which are also removed simultaneously. The search for highly selective and low-cost removal methods is warranted. Therefore, surface-molecular-imprinted polymer-modified TiO2 nanotube (S-MIP-TiO2 NT) photocatalysts were fabricated, characterized, and tested for the removal of estrogenic pollutants from wastewater in this study for the first time. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that the TiO2 NTs (with an average diameter of 60 nm) were successfully imprinted with functional groups (i.e., carboxyl). The adsorption selectivity and photocatalytic activity of the S-MIP-TiO2 NTs towards template compound (17 beta-estradiol, E2) were improved, compared with neat TiO2 NTs. Interestingly, S-MIP-TiO2 NTs exhibited higher adsorption intensity and photocatalytic selectivity at low concentrations (from 10 ng/L to 100 mu g/L, as normal estrogenic chemical concentrations in secondary effluents) of E2 than that at high concentrations (from 10 to 1,000 mg/L). It was also found that some representative estrogenic chemicals and estrogenic activity could be selectively and rapidly removed from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants using S-MIP-TiO2 NTs as photocatalysts. In addition, S-MIP-TiO2 NT photocatalysts exhibited excellent regeneration characteristics. Photocatalytic treatment using S-MIP-TiO2 NTs could be a promising approach for the effective removal of estrogenic chemicals from secondary effluents of municipal WWTPs.

AB The occurrence of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the influent and effluent from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and its receiving water in Beijing, China were determined. Results from the present study confirmed that caffeine, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and chloramphenicol were removed at a high rate (> 70 % efficiency). In contrast, removal efficiency of the other 12 compounds was quite poor (ranged from -40 % to 58 %). Some compounds in the receiving river were present at higher concentrations compared to those in the WWTP effluent, indicating that sources other than treated effluents are present. The risk to the aquatic environment was estimated by a ratio of measured environmental concentration and predicted no-effect concentration. For those compounds found in the effluent and surface water, mefenamic acid, trimethoprim and gemfibrozil may pose a medium risk to aquatic environment.

AB Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used pharmaceutical products with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects that are consistently detected in municipal wastewater systems and in municipal biosolids. Land application of biosolids and irrigation with reclaimed wastewater introduces these compounds into agricultural environments, which is an emerging issue of concern for ecosystem health. In this study, the sorption-desorption behaviour of four commonly consumed NSAIDs, including naproxen (NPX), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KTF), and diclofenac (DCF), was examined in a loam textured soil exposed to either an individual-compound or a mixture of the four NSAIDs. The proportion of NSAIDs adsorbed to the soil in the mixture-compound system was 72%, 55%, 50% and 45%, for diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen, respectively, and differed slightly from the individual compound adsorption. Diclofenac displayed strong sorption and low desorption in both the individual compound and mixture-compound systems. Naproxen and ibuprofen exhibited significant differences between the adsorption isotherms of the individual-compound and mixture-compound systems. Results of this study highlight differences in the sorption behaviour of NSAIDs, when present as mixtures, possibly through multilayer bonding effects or complexation with cationic metals or organo-clays from the soil. Soil organic matter (SOM) may have played a role in determining some of the interactions between the compounds but other factors associated with the mixture-compound system, such as cation bridging or multilayer cooperative adsorption. Desorption data suggests that the mechanisms involved in binding NSAIDs to the soil surface are also influence by the presence of other compounds in a mixture. A reduction in desorption was observed for all four NSAIDs in the mixture-compound system relative to the individual-compound system, but were greatest for naproxen and ibuprofen. The sorption-desorption hysteresis increased for naproxen and ibuprofen in the mixture-compound system. This study suggests that cooperative adsorption plays a role in the interaction of NSAIDs when present as mixtures rather than as individual compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and elimination of seventeen antibiotics (three macrolides: azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin; five quinolones: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, levofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin; five sulfonamides: sulfadimethoxine, sulfadimizine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamonomethoxine; and others: tetracycline, lincomycin, salinomycin and trimethoprim) were investigated at four full-scale sewage treatment plants in Japan. The highest concentration was recorded for clarithromycin (1,129 to 4,820 ng/L) in influent, followed by azithromycin (160 to 1,347 ng/L), levofloxacin (255 to 587 ng/L) and norfloxacin (155 to 486 ng/L). A vary inconsistence picture was obtained with negative to over 90% removal. Nalidixic acid (53 to 100%) exhibited higher removal efficiency followed by norfloxacin (75 to 95%), levofloxacin (40 to 90%), ciprofloxacin (60 to 83%) and enrofloxacin (38 to 74%). Among macrolides, clarithromycin (50 to 88%) and azithromycin (34 to 86%) showed relatively higher removal efficiency than roxithromycin (-32 to 59%). For most of the antibiotics removal efficiency was higher in A2O and AO based secondary treatment process than CAS process. The effect of the antibiotics on bacterial ammonia oxidation determined by oxygen uptake rate presented that there was no significant effect below 0.05 mg/L of each antibiotics. Even at the same concentration, antibiotics in mixed condition had higher inhibition effects than individuals.

AB Hospital wastewater contains a complex mixture of bioactive substances and microorganisms that are deleterious to humans and aquatic animals. In this study, four antibiotics, namely, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, and amoxicillin, respectively, from the wastewater of seven hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, were monitored. The results revealed that the wastewater from these hospitals is contaminated with at least one of the antibiotics. In addition, the degradation capacity of the antibiotics by the wastewater treatment plant at one of the hospitals by the cold plasma technique was investigated. Furthermore, effects of the variation in pH, interelectrode distance, applied voltage, and reaction time on the removal efficiency were investigated in terms of the reduction in antibiotics concentration, COD, and ammonia. Ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, COD, and ammonia were almost eliminated, while ofloxacin and amoxicillin were reduced by more than 72% under optimum conditions (initial pH of 10, reaction time of 15 min, applied voltage of 30 kV, and interelectrode distance of 10 mm). All of these factors affected the removal efficiency. The removal efficiency was most robust in the first 5 min, and it increased with the increase in the reaction time. However, the removal efficiency tended to saturate over time, while it decreased with the increase in the reaction time. With an applied voltage of 30 kV onwards, the removal efficiency was not significantly different. Most of the pollutants were predominately eliminated under slightly alkaline conditions (pH of similar to 10). In addition, primary oxidants in the aqueous phase, such as O-3, H2O2, and .OH, were generated. Besides, the obtained results also revealed that the decomposition of ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime follows the first-order reaction kinetics; meanwhile, the third-order reaction kinetics was most likely for the decomposition of ofloxacin and amoxicillin.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are of increasing interest because of their ecotoxicological properties and environmental impacts. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are the main pathway for their release into freshwaters due to the inefficiency of conventional WWTPs in removing many of these contaminants from effluents. Therefore, different advanced effluent treatment techniques have been proposed for their treatment. However, it is not known at present how effective these treatment methods are and whether on a life cycle basis they cause other environmental impacts which may outweigh the benefits of the treatment. In an effort to provide an insight into this question, this paper considers life cycle environmental impacts of the following advanced treatment techniques aimed at reducing freshwater ecotoxicity potential of PPCPs: granular activated carbon (GAC), nanofiltration (NF), solar photo-Fenton (SPF) and ozonation. The results suggest that on average NF has the lowest impacts for 13 out of 18 categories considered. GAC is the best alternative for five impacts, including metals and water depletion, but it has the highest marine eutrophication. SPF and ozonation are the least sustainable for eight impacts, including ecotoxicity and climate change. GAC and NF are also more efficient in treating heavy metals while avoiding generation of harmful by-products during the treatment, thus being more suitable for potable reuse of wastewater. However, releasing the effluent without advanced treatment to agricultural land achieves a much higher reduction of freshwater ecotoxicity than treating it by any of the advanced treatments and releasing to the environment. Therefore, the use of advanced effluent treatment for agricultural purposes is not recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many trace contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) including a number of pharmaceutically active compounds are not effectively removed during conventional wastewater treatment processes and instead accumulate in wastewater sludge. Unfortunately, many existing sludge stabilization treatments such as anaerobic digestion (AD) also have limited effectiveness against many of these CECs including the four pharmaceuticals ibuprofen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, and azithromycin which can then enter the environment through the disposal or land application of biosolids. Single-stage AD, single-stage cycling aerobic-anoxic (AERO/ANOX) and sequential digesters (AD followed by an AERO/ANOX digester) at sludge retention times (SRT) of 5 to 20-days were evalu-ated side-by-side to assess their effectiveness in removing pharmaceuticals and conventional organic matter. Single-stage ADs (35 degrees C) and AERO/ANOX (22 degrees C) digesters effectively removed total solids while sequential AD + AERO/ANOX digesters offered further improvements. Ibuprofen was not effectively removed during AD and resulted in up to a 23 +/- 8% accumulation. However, ibuprofen was completely removed during AERO/ ANOX digestion and in several sequential digestion scenarios. Each type of digestion was less effective against carbamazepine with slight (3 +/- 2%) accumulations to low levels (14 +/- 1%) of removals in each type of digestion studied. Diclofenac was more effectively removed with up 30 +/- 3% to 39 +/- 4% reductions in the single-stage di-gesters (AD and AERO/ANOX, respectively). While sequential digestion scenarios with the longest aerobic SRTs significantly increased diclofenac removals from their first-stage digesters, scenarios with the longest anaerobic SRTs actually decreased removals from first-stage digesters, possibly due to reversible biotransformation of diclofenac conjugates/metabolites. Up to 43 +/- 6% of azithromycin was removed in AERO/ANOX digesters, while the best performing sequential-digester scenario removed up to 63 +/- 7% of azithromycin. This study shows that different digester configurations can reduce the CEC burden in biosolids while also greatly reducing their volumes for disposal, although none can remove CECs completely.

AB In this study, we investigated the removal of Fe(III), Cr(VI), Al(III), diclofenac, and levofloxacin from treated wastewater in the presence of the free-floating plants Azolla filiculoides and Lemna minuta, to understand whether these species can be effectively used in a surface flow constructed wetland as wastewater refining treatment. Fe and Al were selected owing to their wide use as coagulant agents in wastewater treatment plants for promoting clariflocculation processes, whilst Cr was chosen due to its common use in industry. Diclofenac and levofloxacin, two molecules belonging to the most widely used pharmaceutical classes in the world, were studied as representative anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics, respectively. The study was performed at laboratory scale, exposing the plants separately to each individual contaminant at the concentrations of 5 mg L-1 for the metals (i.e. 2.5-5 times higher than the European limits concerning discharge into surface water), and 1 mu g L-1 for the pharmaceuticals (concentration levels commonly found in wastewater). Depending on the plant species and contaminant tested, the range of different effects observed included low toxicity (i.e. Cr, Fe and diclofenac in L. minuta) and even a stimulatory effect on plant growth (i.e. for A. filiculoides with Al and for L. minuta with Al and levofloxacin). Moreover, both species proved to be very effective in the removal of Fe, Al and levofloxacin, with A. filiculoides showing the best performance (removal efficiency of 92%, 96%, and 60%, respectively), whereas for Cr and diclofenac the removal was always less than 10%. The higher removal capacity of A. filiculoides compared to L. minuta can be attributed to its superior tolerance of the contaminants, probably in turn related to the presence of nitrogen-fixing microorganism in its fronds.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals has become a major problem in many countries worldwide. However, little is known about the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water sources in Japan. The objective of this study was to clarify variations in the concentrations of seven nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and in cyclooxygenase(COX)-inhibiting activities in river water and domestic wastewater collected from the Tone Canal and the Edo River Basin in Japan. Total NSAID concentrations were higher in the Tone Canal than in the Edo River, and the highest concentration was observed at the domestic wastewater inflow point located in the Tone Canal (concentration averages of salicylic acid, ibuprofen, felbinac, naproxen, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, and ketoprofen in wastewater samples were 55.3, 162.9, 39.7, 11.8, 30.8, 259.7, and 48.3 ng L-1, respectively). Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that wastewater samples collected during cooler seasons contained higher levels of COX-inhibiting activity. COX-inhibiting activities were highly correlated with NSAID concentrations (particularly for ketoprofen and diclofenac); however, other COX inhibitors, such as NSAIDs that were not examined in this study and/or other chemicals with COX-inhibiting activity, could exist in the water samples because the concentrations of NSAIDs obtained from the water samples did not account for the total COX-inhibiting activities observed. Therefore, COX inhibition assays may be helpful for evaluating the aquatic toxicity of COX inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that COX inhibitors in surface water may influence aquatic organisms more than was expected based on NSAID concentrations. Thus, further studies examining other COX inhibitors in the aquatic environment are necessary.

AB Effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are known to be point sources of micropollutants for surface waters. The aim of this study was to examine a reconstructed full-scale ozonation equipped with a pump-injector system for ozone (O-3) dosage and a fluidized moving-bed reactor as biological posttreatment at a municipal WWTP utilizing an effect-directed approach. This approach consists of chemical analysis in combination with toxicological tests for the assessment of treatment efficiency of the plant. Chemical analysis showed elimination rates > 80% for pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. Analysis of endocrine disruptors was limited due to substance concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD). Estrogenic activity was detected by the Arxula Adeninivorans yeast estrogen screen (A-YES) at low concentrations (pg to ng EEQ/l range). Estrogenic activity was reduced by more than 90% after ozonation. In contrast, androgenic activity (measured in the Adeninivorans yeast androgen screen, A-YAS) was still found after O-3 treatment and after biological posttreatment, which is consistent with the data obtained by chemical analysis. Furthermore, no marked genotoxic or cytotoxic effects were observed after ozonation using the alkaline comet and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid (MTT) assays, respectively. Results suggest that the applied specific O-3 dose of 0.4 mgO(3)/mgDOC is a safe operation setup in terms of toxicologically relevant transformation products. In addition, no adverse effects on primary producers, as evidenced by algae growth inhibition tests, were detected. The monitored biofilm growth in the biological posttreatment exhibited a steady state after one month. Based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and biomass, one might conclude that O-3 did not apparently enter biological posttreatment to a great extent and that hydraulic retention time in the O-3 reactor was sufficient. Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of a full-scale O-3 treatment in combination with a fluidized moving-bed reactor as biological posttreatment for the reduction of a majority of micropollutants without the release of relevant toxic transformation products as assessed by a chemical and toxicity-based approach.

AB Lab scale and single stage high-solid anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge spiked with freshly synthesized nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) and commercial iron powder (IP) under mesophilic condition (37 +/- 1 degrees C) was performed. The effects of both additives on methane yield, and pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP) removal were investigated. Results showed that methane yield was increased by 25.2% and 40.8% in the presence of nZVI (0.1%) and IP (1.6%), respectively. Removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand were 54.4% and 66.2% in the presence of nZVI and IP, respectively, which were higher compared to the control group (44.6%). In addition, most PPCPs could be partly or completely removed during the anaerobic digestion process. The application of nZVI and IP showed positive impact on the removal of chlorinated PPCPs (p <0.05), but did not show significant impact on other PPCPs (p > 0.05). Our finding suggests that the application of nZVI and IP in anaerobic digestion could be a promising way to enhance methane yield but had less improvement on PPCP degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence in the aquatic environment of xenobiotics such as Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) has emerged as an issue of concern. Upgrading sewage treatment quality with modern technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs) and/or implementing a further post-treatment might mitigate the release of xenobiotics into surface waters. The performance of two processes treating municipal sewage, a MBR and an Activated Sludge (AS) unit, have been compared in terms of PPCPs removal. Moreover, their effluents were treated using vertical flow reed beds. Both systems were operated under similar conditions, more specifically Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), maintained at 8 hours, and Sludge Retention Time (SRT) set at 6 and 20 days. Pharmaceuticals belong to therapeutic groups such as antiepileptics (carbamazepine) and analgesics (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), whereas the personal care products are musk fragrances (galaxolide and tonalide). Xenobiotics removals achieved in the MBR showed better results, particularly for the acidic drugs ibuprofen (87% vs. 50%) and naproxen (56% vs. 6%) operating at low SRT. After filtration through vertical flow reed-beds, PPCPs content in effluents was decreased, below 1 ppb in most cases, improving the effluent quality and confirming reed-beds as an interesting low cost alternative in order to attenuate xenobiotics contamination.

AB Citalopram is one of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) commonly found in treated sewage effluents. Accordingly, there are concerns about possible adverse effects of SSRIs on aquatic organisms, particularly behavioural effects similar to those associated with SSRI use in humans. Rainbow trout fry and adult male guppies were therefore exposed to waterborne citalopram, ranging from environmentally relevant to high concentrations (1, 10,100 mu g/L) for 3-7 days. Under these experimental conditions citalopram does not appear to cause significant effects on aggression in rainbow trout fry or on sexual behaviour in male guppies. This may be explained by a relatively low uptake of citalopram from water to fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A microwave-assisted extraction method for the determination of 15 alkyl, aryl, and halogenated phenols in sewage sludge and biosolids samples was developed and optimized. The effects of solvent, temperature, time, moisture content, acid, and number of extractions on the recovery of phenols were evaluated. Results indicated that extraction solvent had the greatest impact on the recovery of all phenols while pH had the largest effect on recovery of hexachlorophene and pentachlorophenol. Wet sludge samples were extracted with acetone-hexane mixture in the presence of glacial acetic acid. The extract was evaporated, acetylated by acetic anhydride and cleaned up by silica gel. For dry sludge samples, an optional procedure for the simultaneous extraction and acetylation of phenols was also proposed. Triclosan ( TCS) and the alkyl and aryl phenols in sludge extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) in electron-impact mode while polyhalogenated phenols were analyzed by GC-MS in negative ion chemical ionization mode. Method detection limits were ca. 200 ng/g for nonylphenol, < 25 ng/g for TCS and other alkyl and aryl phenols, and < 5 ng/g for other halogenated phenols. This method has been applied to the determination of phenolic compounds in over 150 sludge and biosolids samples since 2009.

AB Aerobic granule was successfully cultivated in SBR (sequencing batch reactor) by struvite carrier (magnesium ammonium phosphate, MgNH4PO4), which can increase polysaccharides to 42.2 mg/gMLVSS (mixed liquor volatile suspended solid) versus only 28.4 mg/gMLVSS of the sludge without it. Meanwhile, it was found that struvite play a positive role in initial granulation and bacterial group distribution in treating pharmaceutical wastewater, involving effect of solid surface and special contents of struvite. The results of fluorescence in situ hybridization technique indicate that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can dominate over nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in mature granules. COD removal efficiency of 90 % and NO2 (-)-N:(NO2 (-)-N + NO3 (-)-N) accumulation efficiency of 89 % were achieved in stable state. Emphasis is placed on that struvite addition can be applied as a new-type carrier to promote formation of partial nitrification granular sludge.

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is an environmentally friendly disinfectant and oxidizer used in several water and wastewater treatment applications. In the present study, PAA was utilized for the conditioning of municipal wastewater sludge before thickening and dewatering. It was shown that PAA can effectively prevent odor formation (i.e., H2S and NH3) and provide hygienization (using E. coli. and Salmonella as indicators). Phytotoxicity can be prevented by controlling the amount PAA-conditioned sludge that is mixed in the soil to be fertilized. The required PAA dose for hygienization was relatively high (480 mg 100% PAA per L sludge) but the results indicated that other sludge stabilization processes are not necessarily required. Therefore, the proposed process involving PAA could be feasible in cases where limited land area is available for sludge processing or quick conditioning of sludge is required. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Purpose of Review Untreated wastewater discharge can significantly and negatively impact the state of the environment. Rapid industrialization and economic development have directly contributed to land and water pollution resulting from the application of many chemicals such as organic dyes, pharmaceuticals, and industrial reagents. The removal of these chemicals before effluent discharge is crucial for environmental protection. This review aims to explore the importance of functionalized materials in the preparation of biocatalytic systems and consider their application in eliminating water pollutants. Recent Findings Wastewater treatment methods can be classified into three groups: (i) chemical (e.g., chemical oxidation and ozonation), (ii) physical (e.g., membrane separation and ion exchange), and (iii) biological processes. Biological treatment is the most widely used method due to its cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. In particular, the use of immobilized enzymes has recently become more attractive as a result of scientific progress in advanced material synthesis. The selection of an appropriate support plays an important role in the preparation of such biologically active systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of various materials for enzyme immobilization in the purification of water. This review identifies and discusses different biocatalytic systems used in the enzymatic degradation of various water pollutants. Materials functionalized by specific groups can serve as good support matrices for enzyme immobilization, providing chemical and thermal stability to support catalytic reactions. Enzymatic biocatalysis converts the pollutants into simpler products, which are usually less toxic than their parents. Due to immobilization, the enzyme can be used over multiple cycles to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment. Future studies in this field should focus on developing new platforms for enzyme immobilization in order to improve degradation efficiency.

AB The treated effluent from sewage treatment plants (STP) is a major source of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that enter the aquatic environment. Bioaccumulation of 11 selected psychoactive pharmaceuticals (citalopram, clomipramine, haloperidol, hydroxyzine, levomepromazine, mianserin, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, tramadol and venlafaxine) was examined in Zivny Stream (tributary of the Blanice River, the Czech Republic), which is a small stream highly affected by effluent from the Prachatice STP. Six of the 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in grab water samples and in passive samplers. All pharmaceuticals were found in fish exposed to the stream for a defined time. The organs with highest presence of the selected pharmaceuticals were the liver and kidney; whereas only one pharmaceutical (sertraline) was detected in the brain of exposed fish. Fish plasma and muscle samples were not adequate in revealing exposure because the number of hits was much lower than that in the liver or kidney. Using the criterion of a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) >= 500, citalopram, mianserin, mirtazapine and sertraline could be classified as potential bioaccumulative compounds. In combination, data from integrative passive samplers and fish liver or kidney tissue samples were complimentary in detection of target compounds and simultaneously helped to distinguish between bioconcentration and bioaccumulation.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and distribution of 11 antibiotics in multiple environmental media including river water, suspended particle, sediment, and soil of the East River catchment, South China, were systematically characterized from multiple spatial (area and point) and temporal (seasonal variation and diurnal variation) scales. The results indicated that six to eight antibiotics were detected in these media. The predominant antibiotics and their concentrations varied with environment media because of the varied contamination sources, physicochemical properties of antibiotics, and media. For their spatial distribution, the river environment including water phase, suspended particles, and sediments showed a similar feature with the rule of C (delta) > C (lower reach) > C (middle reach), which may be related to the industrial level and population density. However, the antibiotics in the soils showed a close relationship with the land use types. A diurnal variation of antibiotics at river sections was mainly affected by the tidal change and diurnal domestic sewage discharge feature. Source analysis indicated that domestic sewage was the main source for antibiotic contamination in the river, while irrigation and fertilization using river water and animal wastes were the main reasons for antibiotic contamination in the soils. However, antibiotics may be redistributed in different media in a catchment.

AB Two different analytical methods for the determination of polycyclic musk fragrances (PMFs) in wastewater and in activated sludge were developed. PMFs in filtered water samples were determined by gas chromatography coupled with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Activated sludge samples were extracted using an ultrasonic bath and analysed using a GC-Ion trap. The developed methods respected a linear model (R-2> 0.995). Detection limits of selected compounds (Celestolide, Galaxolide, Galaxolidone, Phantolide and Tonalide) varied from 1.7 to 80 ng L(-1)for water and from 0.1 ng g(-1)to 210 ng g(-1)for activated sludge considering laboratory contamination for each PMF. Recovery studies were performed on spiked water samples and, for sludges, on procedural blanks, showing recoveries above 70% for all the considered compounds, while recovery of the internal standard was always above limit of acceptance (30%). Proposed methods were used to determine PMFs concentrations in wastewaters and activated sludges of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in Northern Italy. Concentrations in the range of mu g L(-1)of Galaxolide and of its metabolite Galaxolidone were detected even in the WWTP effluent. Biotransformation of Galaxolide into Galaxolidone occurred during biological treatment with the consequent release of this compound through WWTP effluents. In activated sludges, concentrations of all PMFs except Galaxolidone were one order of magnitude higher than wastewaters, as expected according to their physicochemical properties. Present wastewater treatment technologies were confirmed to not be efficient in removing PMFs from influent wastewaters since with only similar or equal to 30% of Celestolide and Tonalide were removed.

AB Ferric-nitrilotriacetate complex (Fe-III-NTA) has been adopted to catalyze the photo-Fenton degradation of emerging pharmaceutical micropollutants in water and wastewater at neutral pH. The generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) in UVA/Fe-III-NTA/H2O2 was identified by using electron spin resonance (ESR) trapping technique. The effects of critical parameters (e.g., NTA:Fe-III molar ratio, Fe-III-NTA and H2O2 dosages) on the steady-state HO center dot concentrations were studied in terms of the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ, as a model compound) in Milli-Q water. In addition, the degradation of pharmaceuticals mixtures (induding CBZ crotamiton (CRMF) and ibuprofen (IBP)) in wastewater effluents from a biological aerated filter (BAF) by UVA/Fe-III-NTA-NTA/H2O2 was studied in continuous-flow mode. The results showed that the efficacies of Fe-III-NTA in catalyzing photo-Fenton degradation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents were comparable to those obtained by Fe-III-ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (Fe-III-EDDS), and far exceeded other Fe-III-L complex (e.g.,citric acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid and tartaric acid). More than 92% degradation efficiencies of CBZ, CRMT and IBP were obtained in continuous-flow mode under the given conditions of 0.178 mM Fe-III-NTA (1:1), 4.54 mM H2O2, UVA intensity 4.05 mW cm(-2), hydraulic retention time (HRT) 2 h, influent pH 7.6 (+/- 0.2) and temperature 20 degrees C. The results presented herein suggest that Fe-III-NTA-catalyzed neutral photo-Fenton reaction can be an alternative tertiary process for the treatment of pharmaceutical micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluents.

AB The photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of three compounds spiked in secondary treated wastewater by means of simulated solar radiation over titania suspensions was investigated. Bisphenol-A (BPA) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) were chosen as representatives of emerging micro-contaminants, while phenol was chosen as a reference contaminant. Ten titania samples were synthesized and employed to evaluate the effect of doping with nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, silver, sodium and potassium, as well as platinum dispersion on photocatalytic activity. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption and selective chemisorption of CO or hydrogen.
   A 0.5% Pt/TiO2 catalyst (38 m(2)/g surface area, 72:28 anatase:rutile, 20 and 2 nm crystallite size for TiO2 and Pt, respectively) was highly active for the degradation of the contaminants, whose reactivity increased in the order: phenol < BPA <= EE2: a commercially available Aeroxide P25 TiO2 exhibited comparable activity.
   The effect of various operating conditions, such as 0.5% Pt/TiO2 concentration (125-1000 mg/L), initial contaminant concentration (100-300 mu g/L each), photon flux (17.4 x 10(-8)-58 x 10(-8) einstein/(Ls) provided by a 150 W Xenon lamp) and the water matrix (wastewater and ultrapure water), on degradation was then assessed. Reaction rates increased linearly with catalyst concentration and photon flux, confirming the photo-induced nature of the activation of the catalytic process: likewise, a linear dependence of rate on initial concentration occurred denoting first order kinetics. Degradation in wastewater was slower than in pure water by an order of magnitude, implying the scavenging behavior of effluent's constituents against hydroxyl radicals.
   The implications for tertiary wastewater treatment (e.g. mineralization, disinfection and removal of estrogenicity) are also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of antibiotics in aquatic environment has led to an increasing concern about the potential environmental risks and the spread of antibacterial resistance among microorganisms. Electrochemical oxidation processes are promising technologies to treat low contents of toxic and bio-refractory pollutants in water. Anodic oxidation of berberine, the frequently detected antibiotic in surface waters, was carried out by using RuO2/Ti, IrO2/Ti, RuIrO2/Ti, and Pt/Ti electrodes. It showed that with Pt/Ti anode, the removal efficiency of berberine was significantly higher than that with the other electrodes. Moreover, all the four electrodes showed 3-5 times higher reaction rate constant in NaCl solution than in Na2SO4 solution. The addition of chloride salts increased the oxidation rate of berberines due to the formation of active chlorines. In the case of Pt/Ti anode and simulated berberine wastewater, the effects of applied anodic bias, initial pH, Cl- and berberine concentrations, and reaction time on the removal efficiency of berberines were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of applied bias of 2.0 V, initial pH of 5.0, and Cl- concentration of 0.1 mol/L, the removal efficiency was higher than 90.0 % after 1-h reaction when the berberine concentration was lower than 50 mg/L. The acute toxicity of the simulated berberine wastewater could be largely reduced under the optimum conditions. Ultraviolet-visible adsorption spectra and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra also confirmed that although berberines could not be fully mineralized after 1 h of electrochemical treatment, most of them were easily oxidized and decomposed by the electrolysis, thus forming some intermediate products with simple aromatic structures. Based on the results obtained, the electrochemical process with Pt/Ti electrode can be a feasible alternative as a post-treatment or treatment for berberine wastewater.

AB Realized and potential threats of water scarcity due in part to global climate change have increased the interest in potable reuse of municipal wastewater. Recalcitrant trace organic compounds (TOrCs), including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in wastewater are often not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Ozone application has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient oxidation process to attenuate TOrCs. However, operation of ozone oxidation can be challenging in wastewater due to variations in water quality that can impact critical control points through fluctuations in ozone demand/decay. Therefore, this study implemented three explanatory modeling techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neutral network (ANN), and PC (principal component)ANN to predict TOrCs removal by ozone oxidation in a secondary wastewater effluent. All the developed models displayed good agreements between the predicted TOrCs removal and the observed TOrCs removal with the explanatory variables (input variables) of ozone dose, total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, and rate constants of ozone and. OH. PC-ANN displayed the highest predictive power in the external validation step (R-2 = 0.934) successively followed by ANN (R-2 = 0.914) and MLR (R-2 = 0.758). Based on the MLR model equation and the result of sensitivity analysis of the ANN model, TOC was found to have negligible effects on the TOrCs removal in a given water quality. Despite the predictive power of the ANN model, possible overfitting remains to be solved since the cross validation coefficient (q(2)) value calculated by the leave-one-out cross validation was not sufficient to ensure model predictive power. In contrast, the PC-ANN model was found to be robust across the scenarios applied. This study provides a guideline for software sensors to control ozone treatment processes in regards to TOrC oxidation and likely can be adapted to monitor disinfection as well.

AB Irrigation with wastewater releases pharmaceuticals, pathogenic bacteria, and resistance genes, but little is known about the accumulation of these contaminants in the environment when wastewater is applied for decades. We sampled a chronosequence of soils that were variously irrigated with wastewater from zero up to 100 years in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico, and investigated the accumulation of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, carbamazepine, bezafibrate, naproxen, diclofenac, as well as the occurrence of Enterococcus spp., and sul and qnr resistance genes. Total concentrations of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine increased with irrigation duration reaching 95% of their upper limit of 1.4 mu g/kg (ciprofloxacin), 4.3 mu g/kg (sulfamethoxazole), and 5.4 mu g/kg (carbamazepine) in soils irrigated for 19-28 years. Accumulation was soil-type-specific, with largest accumulation rates in Leptosols and no time-trend in Vertisols. Acidic pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, naproxen, bezafibrate) were not retained and thus did not accumulate in soils. We did not detect qnrA genes, but qnrS and qnrB genes were found in two of the irrigated soils. Relative concentrations of sul1 genes in irrigated soils were two orders of magnitude larger (3.15x10(-3)+/- 0.22x10(-3) copies/16S rDNA) than in non-irrigated soils (4.35x10(-5)+/- 1.00x10(-5) copies/16S rDNA), while those of sul2 exceeded the ones in nonirrigated soils still by a factor of 22 (6.61x10(-4)+/- 0.59x10(-4) versus 2.99x10(-5)+/- 0.26x10(-5) copies/16S rDNA). Absolute numbers of sul genes continued to increase with prolonging irrigation together with Enterococcus spp. 23S rDNA and total 16S rDNA contents. Increasing total concentrations of antibiotics in soil are not accompanied by increasing relative abundances of resistance genes. Nevertheless, wastewater irrigation enlarges the absolute concentration of resistance genes in soils due to a long-term increase in total microbial biomass.

AB Little is known about the occurrence of emerging environmental contaminants, such as benzotriazoles (BTRs), benzothiazoles (BTHs), benzophenones (BzPs), and bisphenol analogues (BPs) in India. In this study, we determined the occurrence and removal of BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs in five Indian sewage treatment plants (STPs). The respective measured mean concentrations (N = 5) in influents and effluents were 370 and 57.4 ng L-1 for BTRs, 50800 and 20200 ng L-1 for BTHs, 351 and 163 ng L-1 for BzPs, and 98.0 and 9.6 ng L-1 for BPs. Among the target chemicals analyzed, BTHs were found at elevated levels, and the measured levels were some of the highest ever reported in the literature. The mean concentrations (N = 5) of BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs in sludge were 442, 51200, 124, and 200 ng g(-1) dry wt, respectively. The removal efficiencies for BTRs, BTHs, BzPs, and BPs ranged as follows: 54.2-85.6%, 23.4-85.0%, 51.8-71%, and 76.0-97.0%, respectively, and were comparable to those reported for other countries. Elevated concentrations of BTHs in Indian STPs can be related to consumption of these chemicals in a wide range of products including paper, textile and rubber materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) is seen as a very promising technology to remove micropollutants (MPs) from wastewater. Unfortunately this process tends to produce a highly saline concentrate stream, as commercial NF membranes retain both the MPs and most of the ions. The high salinity makes subsequent degradation of the MPs in a bioreactor very difficult. The main goal of this study is to prepare and study a NF membrane that combines a low salt rejection with a high MPs rejection for the treatment of secondary-treated municipal wastewater. This membrane was prepared using layer by layer (LbL) deposition of the weak polycation poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and the weak polyanion poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), on the surface of a hollow fiber dense ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. The ionic strength of the coating solutions was varied and properties of the formed polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), such as hydration, hydrophilicity, hydraulic resistance and ions retention were studied. Subsequently we tested the apparent and steady state rejection of MPs from synthetic wastewater under cross-flow conditions. The synthetic wastewater contained the MPs Diclofenac, Naproxen, Ibuprofen and 4n-Nonylphenol, all under relevant concentrations (0.5-40 mu g/L, depending on the MP). PEMs prepared at lower ionic strength showed a lower hydration and consequently a better retention of MPs than PEMs prepared at higher ionic strengths. A strong relationship between the apparent rejection of MPs and their hydrophobicity was observed, likely due to adsorption of the more hydrophobic MPs to the membrane surface. Once saturated (steady state), the molecular size of the MPs showed the best correlation with their rejection, indicating rejection on the basis of size exclusion. In contrast to available commercial NF membranes with both high salt and MP rejection, we have prepared an unique membrane with a very low NaCl retention (around 17%) combined with a very promising removal of MPs, with Diclofenac, Naproxen, Ibuprofen and 4n-Nonylphenol being removed up to 77%, 56%, 44% and 70% respectively. This membrane would allow the treatment of secondary treated municipal wastewater, strongly reducing the load of MPs, without producing a highly saline concentrate stream.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiency for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in two of eThekwini Municipality's wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), Kingsburgh and Umbilo, were investigated. This paper describes a simple method that can be used routinely for the simultaneous determination of such compounds in the influent and effluent of the WWTPs. Target compounds were extracted from wastewater and pre-concentrated using the optimized Oasis MAX solidphase extraction (SPE) method. During SPE, the pH of wastewater samples was adjusted to 2.5; then 100 mL of each sample was loaded onto a pre-conditioned cartridge. The SPE cartridge was rinsed with methanol: water (10: 90%, v: v) prior to sequential elution of retained analytes with 2 mL methanol, followed by 2 mL methanol and acetic acid (90: 10, v:v) and 2 mL of 2% (v:v) formic acid diluted using a mixture of methanol and acetic acid (40:60, v:v). The eluted analytes from the SPE cartridge were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with photo diode array detection. The analytical method was validated by spiking deionized water with 5 and 50 mu g . L-1 of target compounds, for which the recovery range of 76 to 98% was achieved with good precision. The instrument quantification limits obtained were 0.1 mu g . L-1, for naproxen and 0.4 mu g . L-1 for both ibuprofen and diclofenac. The detected concentrations for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in the influent of both WWTPs were in the ranges of 15-20 mu g . L-1, 55-69 mu g . L-1 and 6.4-16 mu g . L-1, respectively. In effluent, the detected concentrations for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were in the ranges of 0.6-1.1, 2.1-4.2 and 1.4-2.0 mu g . L-1, respectively. Overall, the employed SPE-HPLC method led to rapid pre-concentration of target compounds prior to their trace quantification in wastewater samples.

AB The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in pollution associated with antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban water systems, threatening the public health and the ecological security. In this study, the patterns of the diversity and abundance of the antibiotics and ARGs in a typical city (Kunming, China) were analyzed by monitoring their presence in the tap water, the land block sewage discharge units, the sewage pipes, the influent of WWTP, the effluent of WWTP, and the urban river channel. The results showed that although the average concentration of total antibiotics in tap water was 10 ng/L, the concentrations reached hundreds or even thousands of ng/L in all the other sections, indicating antibiotics entering water system through human or pets discharge. The relative abundances of ARG copies to 16S rRNA gene copies in the effluent of WWTP, the urban river channel which was the downstream of WWTP were higher than those of the sewage pipes, increasing risk of ARG transfer after treatment by WWTP. In general, the relative abundance of ARGs in spring was higher than that in winter. There was no significant correlation between antibiotics concentrations and their corresponding ARGs, except for a correlation between tetracyclines and tet-resistance genes. Due to the existence of transposases, the urban water system is exposed to a widespread risk of horizontal transfer of ARGs.

AB A method based on matrix-solid phase dispersion (MSPD), focused on the principles of green analytical chemistry, aimed at the use of alternative solid supports and less toxic solvents, was developed for the simultaneous determination of 19 pharmaceuticals, 4 personal care products (PPCPs) and 4 degradation products in sewage sludge samples. Higher recoveries were achieved when 2 g sample was macerated for 5 min in a glass mortar, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and 1 min vortex agitation with 5 mL methanol. The performance of the method was evaluated through linearity, recovery, precision (intra-day), method detection and quantification limits (MDL and MQL) and matrix effect. The calibration curves prepared in methanol and in the matrix extract showed a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. MQL values ranged from 1.25 to 1250 ng g(-1). Recoveries between 50 and 120% were reached with RSDs lower than 20% for most compounds. The method presented low and medium matrix effects for most analytes. This method was successfully applied to real samples and of the 27 compounds determined, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, diclofenac, haloperidol, ketoconazole, miconazole, albendazole, mebendazole, thiabendazole, triclosan and triclocarban were detected in concentrations between 2.5 and 5400 ng g(-1).

AB Emerging pollutants in the form of pharmaceuticals have drawn international attention during the past few decades. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a common drug widely found in effluents from hospitals, industrial and different wastewater treatment plants, as well as rivers. In this work, the lab-scale 3D-BER system was established, and more than 90% of the antibiotic CIP was removed from Low C/N wastewater. The best results were obtained with the current intensity being taken into account, and a different C/N ratio significantly improved the removal of CIP and nitrates when the ideal conditions were C/N = 1.5-3.5, pH = 7.0-7.5 and I = 60 mA. The highest removal efficiency occurred when CIP = 94.2%, NO3--N = 95.5% and total nitrogen (TN) = 84.3%, respectively. In this novel system, the autotrophic-heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria played a vital role in the removal of CIP and an enhanced denitrification process. Thus, autotrophic denitrifying bacteria uses CO2 and H-2 as carbon sources to reduce nitrates to N-2. This system has the assortment and prosperous community revealed at the current intensity of 60 mA, and the analysis of bacterial community structure in effluent samples fluctuates under different conditions of C/N ratios. Based on the results of LC-MS/MS analysis, the intermediate products were proposed after efficient biodegradation of CIP. The microbial community on biodegrading was mostly found at phylum, and the class level was dominantly responsible for the NO3--N and biodegradation of CIP. This work can provide some new insights towards the biodegradation of CIP and the efficient removal of nitrates from low C/N wastewater treatment through the novel 3D-BER system.

AB Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the residence (or flushing) time of water in Vidy Bay (north shore of Lake Geneva) for different meteorological conditions. A hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW) was applied to simulate the flow field in the embayment during 2010 and January 2011. Using these results, particle tracking was applied to estimate transport of wastewater effluent discharged into the embayment. The model predictions compared well with published field measurements of dissolved species (as given by electrical conductivity profiles) within the wastewater. The pelagic boundary of the embayment was defined by the largest within-bay gyre. Based on this definition, particle tracking was used to quantify the residence time under dominant wind conditions. Similarly, particle tracking was used to determine the travel time (i.e., time to exit the embayment) for each of Vidy Bay's three inflows (stream, stormwater and wastewater effluent). Although the wind field over the lake is variable, current patterns in the embayment can be simulated using the hydrodynamic model forced by a spatially uniform wind field. For a given wind speed, the main factor influencing residence and travel times is the wind angle. The presence of gyres leads to high mean residence times with large variability. As the wind direction becomes more aligned with the shoreline (i.e., with increasing westerly or easterly components), longshore currents dominate. These disrupt gyre formation and markedly reduce the mean and variability of embayment residence time. The numerical model was utilized to assess the potential for plume movement (in plan) from above the wastewater effluent outfall towards one of Lausanne's drinking water intakes. In the most direct pathway, westward longshore currents can move water from the embayment to the water column above the intake location.

AB Background: Municipal wastewaters contain a multitude of organic compounds derived from domestic and industrial sources including active components of pharmaceutical and personal care products and compounds used in agriculture, such as pesticides, or food processing such as artificial sweeteners often referred to as micropollutants. Some of these compounds or their degradation products may have detrimental effects on the environment, wildlife and humans. Acesuflame is one of the most popular artificial sweeteners to date used in foodstuffs. The main objectives of this descriptive study were to evaluate the presence of micropollutants in both the influent and effluent of a large-scale conventional biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in South-East Queensland receiving wastewater from households, hospitals and various industries.
   Methods: Based on USEPA Method 1694: Filtered samples were spiked with mass-labelled chemical standards and then analysed for the micropollutants using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
   Results: The presence of thirty-eight compounds were detected in the wastewater influent to the treatment plant while nine of the compounds in the categories of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, alkaloid and lipid/cholesterol lowering drugs were undetectable (100 % removed) in the effluent. They were: Analgesic: Paracetamol, Salicylic acid, Oxycodone; Anti-inflammatory: Naproxen + ve, Atorvastatin, Indomethacin, Naproxen; Alkaloid: Caffeine; Lipid/cholesterol lowering: Gemfibrozol.
   Conclusions: The study results revealed that the micropollutants removal through this biological treatment process was similar to previous research reported from other countries including Europe the Americas and Asia, except for acesulfame, a highly persistent artificial sweetener. Surprisingly, acesulfame was diminished to a much greater extent (> 90 %) than previously reported research for this type of WWTPs (45-65 %) that only include physical removal of objects and solids and a biodegradation step.

AB Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a threat to human life. Recently, sewers have been identified as potential reservoirs. The intermittent injection of sewage into adjacent surface waters is inevitable, due to capacity limitations of the urban drainage system. Information regarding the effect to natural freshwater biofilms (NFB) due to the intermittent contaminations are scarce. Therefore, a fundamental screening is necessary. In April, we placed NFB-attachment constructions in a brook upstream and downstream from urban drainage overflow constructions. In meanwhile two sampling campaigns were conducted. The sewage and the brook water were collected to gather information about antibiotic background exposure of ciprofloxacin (CIP), clarithromycin (CIA) and doxycycline (DOX). Six months later we experimentally determined the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the NFB-communities after a 24 h lasting exposure with additionally dosed antibiotics. Concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 were selected. CIP, CIA and DOX were individually dosed, and also in mixtures. The mean antibiotic background concentration in sewage was in a range of 575.5-1289.1 ng L-1, which mainly exceeded the concentrations published in literature. The determined mean concentration in the brook was in a range of 4.6-539.0 ng L-1. The first significant inhibition of the OUR with individually dosed antibiotics started mainly at a concentration of 1.0 mg L-1. Antibiotics in a mixture with concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg L-1 were as effective as single dosed antibiotics with a concentration of 10.0 mg L-1. The increased antibiotic tolerance and resistance of NFB-communities downstream of the combined sewer overflow (CSO) structure was a consequence of a severe impact due to urban drainage overflows. Hence, NFB-communities downstream of CSO-constructions are hot spots of antibiotic tolerant and resistant subpopulations and access restrictions should be announced, if an infection risk is present.

AB Pharmaceuticals present in sewage may inhibit the biological processes in a sewage treatment plant. In this work, the toxic-effect of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, propranolol hydrochloride, diclofenac sodium, ofloxacin and clofibric acid) on the anaerobic digestion process is assessed. Acetoclastic methanogenes are the most sensitive group of microorganisms participating in the anaerobic digestion process. Appropriate toxicity tests for these microorganisms were then based on assessing the impact of pharmaceuticals on the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the anaerobic biomass. The toxicity was expressed by the IC80 and IC50 Values, i.e. the concentration at which bioactivity was 80% and 50% of the control, respectively. Results showed that the pharmaceuticals tested caused a mild inhibition to the methanogenes in most cases, related directly to the tendency of the compounds to adsorb on the anaerobic biomass.

AB In arid and semi-arid areas the use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation and other agricultural practices, such as the use of pesticides, increase the number of emerging contaminants (ECs) in crops. Hazards of these practices to human being are largely unknown since there are few studies yet covering a short range of compounds and most of them under non-realistic conditions. This study aims at assessing this problem that will become global soon in an area of Saudi Arabia heavily affected by the reuse of treated wastewater and pesticide in order to ascertain its scale. The novelty of the study relays in the large number of ECs covered and the variety of crops (cabbage, barley, green beans, eggplants, chili, tomato and zucchini) analysed. Extraction procedure developed provided an appropriate extraction yield (up to 50% of the compounds were recovered within a 70-120% range), with good repeatability (relative standard deviations below 20% in most cases) and sensitivity (LOQ b 25 ng g(-1)) for the model compounds. Determination by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QqTOF-MS) is able to identify >2000 contaminants. Sixty-four ECs were identified in wastewater but of the sixty-four compounds, six pharmaceuticals (atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine and its metabolites 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and naproxen) and seven pesticides (acetamiprid, atrazine deethyl, azoxystrobin, bupirimate, diazinon, malathion, pirimicarb and some of their metabolites) were detected in plants. Furhermore, one metabolite of the ibuprofen (not detected in water or soil), the ibuprofen hexoside was also found in plants. Up to our knowledge, this study demonstrate for the first time the accumulation of ECs in crops irrigated with treated wastewater under real non-controlled environmental conditions.

In the pilot BNR process, 96 +/- 5% of the estrogenicity exerted by the influent wastewater was removed by the treatment process. The degradation efficiencies in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones of the pilot BNR bioreactor were 11 +/- 9%, 18 +/- 2% and 93 +/- 10%, respectively. In order to further understand the performance of the BNR process in the removal of estrogenicity from wastewater, a bench scale BNR process was operated with synthetic wastewater dosed with E1 and E2. The removal of estrogenicity in the bench scale system (95 +/- 5%) was comparable to the pilot BNR process and the degradation efficiencies were estimated to be 8 +/- 0.8%, 38 +/- 4% and 85 +/- 22% in the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones, respectively. A biotransformation model developed to predict the fate of El and E2 in batch tests using the sludge from the BNR process was calibrated using the data from the experiments. The biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of E2 to El were estimated as 71 +/- 15, 31 +/- 3.3 and 1 +/- 0.9 L g COD-1 d(-1) for the aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic batch tests, respectively, while the corresponding biotransformation rate constants for the transformation of El were estimated to be 73 +/- 1.0, 3 +/- 2.0, and 0.85 +/- 0.6 L.g COD-1 d(-1). A steady state mass balance model formulated to describe the interactions between E2 and El in BNR activated sludge reasonably described the fate of El and E2 in the BNR process, (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Contaminants released from wastewater treatment plants can persist in surface waters for substantial distances. Much research has gone into evaluating the fate and transport of these contaminants, but this work has often assumed constant flow from wastewater treatment plants. However, effluent discharge commonly varies widely over a 24-hour period, and this variation controls contaminant loading and can profoundly influence interpretations of environmental data. We show that methodologies relying on the normalization of downstream data to conservative elements can give spurious results, and should not be used unless it can be verified that the same parcel of water was sampled. Lagrangian sampling, which in theory samples the same water parcel as it moves downstream (the Lagrangian parcel), links hydrologic and chemical transformation processes so that the in-stream fate of wastewater contaminants can be quantitatively evaluated. However, precise Lagrangian sampling is difficult, and small deviations - such as missing the Lagrangian parcel by less than 1 h - can cause large differences in measured concentrations of all dissolved compounds at downstream sites, leading to erroneous conclusions regarding in-stream processes controlling the fate and transport of wastewater contaminants. Therefore, we have developed a method termed "verified Lagrangian" sampling, which can be used to determine if the Lagrangian parcel was actually sampled, and if it was not, a means for correcting the data to reflect the concentrations which would have been obtained had the Lagrangian parcel been sampled. To apply the method, it is necessary to have concentration data for a number of conservative constituents from the upstream, effluent, and downstream sites, along with upstream and effluent concentrations that are constant over the short-term (typically 2-4 h). These corrections can subsequently be applied to all data, including non-conservative constituents. Finally, we show how data from other studies can be corrected. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Concentrations of 17 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and their major metabolites (bupropion, hydroxy-bupropion, erythro-hydrobupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, carbamazepine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine, citalopram, N-desmethyl-citalopram, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, 2-N-glucuronide-lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine), were measured in treated wastewater and receiving surface waters from 24 locations across Minnesota, USA. The analysis of upstream and downstream sampling sites indicated that the wastewater treatment plants were the major source of the neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites in surface waters of Minnesota. Concentrations of parent compound and the associated metabolite varied substantially between treatment plants (concentrations +/- standard deviation of the parent compound relative to its major metabolite) as illustrated by the following examples; bupropion and hydrobupropion 700 +/- 1000 ng L-1, 2100 +/- 1700 ng L-1, carbamazepine and 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine 480 +/- 380 ng L-1, 360 +/- 400 ng L-1, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine 1400 +/- 1300 ng L-1, 1800 +/- 2300 ng L-1. Metabolites of the neuro-active compounds were commonly found at higher or comparable concentrations to the parent compounds in wastewater effluent and the receiving surface water. Neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites were detected only sporadically in samples upstream from the effluent outfall. Metabolite to parent ratios were used to evaluate transformation, and we determined that ratios in wastewater were much lower than those reported in urine, indicating that the metabolites are relatively more labile than the parent compounds in the treatment plants and in receiving waters. The widespread occurrence of neuro-active pharmaceuticals and metabolites in Minnesota effluents and surface waters indicate that this is likely a global environmental issue, and further understanding of the environmental fate and impacts of these compounds is warranted.

AB Amphoteric pharmaceuticals are released to the environment in treated wastewater, medicated aquaculture feed, and through land disposal of livestock wastes and municipal biosolids. These wastes are rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which may bind and potentially enhance pharmaceutical transport in the environment. To assess this potential, the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin (CIP) was chosen as a model amphoteric pharmaceutical to quantify DOC-water sorption coefficients (K-doc, L kg(-1) DOC) for four reference humic materials with varying chemical properties, digested and undigested municipal biosolids, treated municipal wastewater. and beef lagoon wastewater. For reference humic materials, the predominance of sorption by cation exchange was exemplified by decreasing sorption with increasing pH and ionic strength, as well as highly predictable relationships between the sorbed CIP concentration normalized to the DOC charge versus the free aqueous concentration of the CIP cation. In contrast to humic materials, however, sorption to DOC from digested biosolids was low and showed no pH dependence, suggesting that additional weaker mechanisms contributed to binding interactions. CIP had no quantifiable affinity for DOC from undigested biosolids, treated wastewater, or beef lagoon wastewater. With K-doc values of similar to 10(4) L kg(-1) estimated for CIP concentrations reported in biosolids (similar to 20-60 mu g kg(-1) wwt), the DOC measured for digested biosolids in this study (40 mg L-1) could increase CIP mobility by up to similar to 15%, thus DOC-facilitated transport should be considered in environmental fate assessments for amphoteric pharmaceuticals. However, the potential for waste-derived DOC to enhance CIP transport would have been greatly overestimated using information derived only from reference humic materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Monitoring the consumption of pharmaceuticals and licit drugs is important for assessing the needs of public health owing to the impact on individuals as well as society. The present work applied wastewater-based epidemiology to profile the spatial patterns of metformin, nicotine, and caffeine use and their correlations. Influent wastewater samples were collected from 27 wastewater treatment plants in 22 typical Chinese cities that covered all geographic regions of the country. The consumption of metformin ranged from 0.02 g/d/1000 inh to 8.92 g/d/1000 inh, whereas caffeine and nicotine consumption ranged from 4.33 g/d/1000 inh to 394 g/d/1000 inh and 0.17 g/d/1000 inh to 1.88 g/d/1000 inh, respectively. There were significant regional differences in the consumption of caffeine, with the highest consumption in East China and the lowest consumption in Northeast China. The consumption and concentration of caffeine were related to the gross domestic product and per capita disposable income of urban residents, respectively. There was a correlation between the concentrations of caffeine and cotinine (a nicotine metabolite), thereby indicating that individuals that use one of these substances are likely to use the other substance. A significant relationship was found between the concentration of metformin and cotinine, thereby implying that the use of tobacco may be correlated with type 2 diabetes. Co-analysis of these substances in wastewater may provide a more accurate picture of substance use situations within different communities and provide more information on human health, human behavior, and the economy. This report describes the newest study related to the consumption of metformin among the general population in China.

AB Millions of tourists visit Kenting National Park (KNP) in southern Taiwan every year, causing great amount of sewage discharges in this area. This study aimed to assess the impact of sewage on KNP surface waters using zebrafish embryo-larval bioassays combined with chemical analyses of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Surface water samples were collected monthly from May to October in 2010. During the monthly bioassays, zebrafish embryos were exposed to the water samples for 144 h. Hatchability, embryonic heart rate, larval survival rate, and deformities were recorded. Larval swimming behavior was also digitally quantified at the end of exposure. Significant decreases in hatchability and larval survival rate were observed at all sites. Both hatchability and larval survival rate were negatively correlated with nitrite and ammonia concentrations in the water. The field water had little effect on embryonic heart rate and morphology. However, lower swimming speeds and activity levels were observed in the larvae, suggesting neurobehavioral toxicity of the surface waters. The general detection frequency of the 28 target PPCPs was 75%. High levels of some PPCPs, particularly caffeine, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), and nonylphenol, were measured in the water samples. Our results show that surface waters in KNP have been strongly impacted by human activities, resulting in lethal and behavioral toxicities in developing fish.

AB In this study, the efficiencies of selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove selected perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) during wastewater treatment processes were evaluated. For this purpose, Influent samples from Daspoort, Zeekoegat and Phola WWTPs, were initially screened for the presence of sixteen different PFASs of which only seven were detected. These include: perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoro-n-pentanoic acid (PPPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorooctanoic add (PFOA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (L-PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS).
   To determine the concentrations of these PFASs, wastewater samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that L-PFOS was the dominant compound with the highest concentration of 508 +/- 258 ng/L at Daspoort WWTP. Overall, the three WWTPs could not achieve the complete influent-to-effluent removal of the PFASs and the best removals were observed at Zeekoegat WWTP.
   The removal efficiency of the different unit processes varied from one plant to another and also from each type of PFASs. At Daspoort, the removal efficiency of the primary settling tanks was poor and the highest removal reached 39% for PFHxA. The activated sludge (AS) of this WWTP achieved the highest removal of 84% for the L-PFOS. At Zeekoegat, the AS achieved the highest removal of 94% for the L-PFOS. The anaerobic pond at Phola achieved a higher removal of 80% for the L-PFOS. However, no removal was observed downstream of the biological filter for the same compound. Poor removal efficiency was reported downstream of the wetland at Phola except for the PFOA (16%).

AB Sulfonamide antibiotks have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse bio-effect and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance. This study investigated the degradation kinetics of sulfonamide antibiotics in synthetic wastewater and hydrolyzed human urine by low pressure (LP) UV, UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS). Direct photolysis rates of sulfonamide antibiotics varied and depended on the structures. Sulfonamides with a five-membered heterocyclic group underwent faster direct photolysis. For indirect photolysis processes, second-order rate constants of sulfonamide antibiotics with hydroxyl radical, sulfate radical and carbonate radical were determined, which were (6.21-9.26) x 10(9), (0.77-16.1) x 10(10) and (1.25-8.71) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. A dynamic model was applied and successfully predicted the degradation kinetics of sulfonamides in different water matrices. In synthetic wastewater, carbonate radical contributed to approximately 10% of the overall removal, whereas in synthetic hydrolyzed urine, carbonate radical was the dominant reactive species to degrade sulfonamides. Sulfonamide antibiotics were eliminated more efficiently in synthetic hydrolyzed urine than in synthetic wastewater and UV/PDS was more efficient than UV/H2O2 to degrade most sulfonamides. Energy evaluation showed that UV/PDS costs less energy than LPUV and UV/H2O2 under the experimental conditions applied in this study, particularly for sulfonamides whose indirect photolysis overweighed direct photolysis. By varying UV dose and oxidant dose, the UV/H2O2 process can be optimized to achieve higher efficiency than the UV/PDS process in synthetic wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To minimize the risk of antibiotic wastewater generated by the pharmaceutical industries, the potential separation efficacy of tetracycline (TC) from aqueous solution using forward osmosis (FO) process with thin film composite membrane was systematically studied. First, the microstructure and transport properties of TFC membrane were characterized. Then, the effects of membrane orientation, feed velocity and solution pH on the behavior of the FO process for TC separation were studied. Finally, the performance of TFC membrane for TC separation in a long-term FO mode operation was investigated. The results showed that the membrane performance in FO mode (active layer facing the feed solution) and PRO mode (active layer facing the draw solution) was highly affected by solute resistivity (K) value. The water flux and TC rejection achieved over 20 LMH and 99.0% in FO mode, respectively. High TC concentration factor (CF) of 2.6 was obtained in FO mode, indicating the concentrated TC solution could be harnessed to recover the TC by conventional crystallization. However, severe water flux decline accompanied with low tetracycline CF was found in PRO mode, which was mainly attributed to serious fouling and high K value occurred in the porous support. With the flow velocity rising, the shear stress and mass transfer coefficient (k) on the membrane surface increased, alleviating the membrane fouling. Acidic environment would favor the separation due to the change of TC speciation and TFC membrane properties. A long-term testing demonstrated that more than 97% TC rejection and 74% water flux recovery were well maintained with simple hydraulic cleaning after 5 cycles FO mode operation. This work implied that the FO based technology could be developed as an effective alternative for the treatment of tetracycline antibiotic wastewater as well as the recovery of antibiotics from the wastewater.

AB The widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy medication has made antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) a significant pharmaceutical class in regions of high HIV infection rates. However, relatively little is known regarding the environmental occurrence of these emerging contaminants, and this is especially true for their metabolites. In this work, we report analytical methods to study the simultaneous occurrence of a range of common ARVDs and some of their known metabolites in surface water and wastewater. A novel direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method is reported for the analysis of ARVDs of different therapeutic classes and their selected metabolites in wastewater samples. In addition, a solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure was developed for pre-concentration of ARVs and metabolites from surface water samples. The respective methods proved suitable for the quantitative analysis of six parent ARVDs from three ARV classes, as well as three metabolites. Method validation showed average recoveries of 86% for the direct injection method, and 64% for the SPE method. With the exception of Zidovudine and the metabolites of Zidovudine and Ritonavir, all target ARVDs were detected in wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants in the Western Cape, South Africa. Higher concentrations were generally measured in influent compared to effluent samples, in the dry compared to the wet season as well as in chlorinated compared to uv-irradiated effluents. This study contributes for the first time quantitative data on the environmental occurrence of the known metabolites of Nevirapine (12-hydroxy-Nevirapine) and Efavirenz (8,14-dihydroxy-Efavirenz).

AB Understanding the sorption of pharmaceuticals to sewage sludge during waste water treatment processes is important for understanding their environmental fate and in risk assessments. The degree of sorption is defined by the sludge/water partition coefficient (K-d). Experimental K-d values (n = 297) for active pharmaceutical ingredients (n= 148) in primary and activated sludge were collected from literature. The compounds were classified by their charge at pH 7.4 (44 uncharged, 60 positively and 28 negatively charged, and 16 zwitterions). Univariate models relating log K-d to log K-ow for each charge class showed weak correlations (maximum R-2 = 0.51 for positively charged) with no overall correlation for the combined dataset (R-2 = 0.04). Weaker correlations were found when relating log K-d to log D-ow. Three sets of molecular descriptors (Molecular Operating Environment, VolSurf and ParaSurf) encoding a range of physico-chemical properties were used to derive multivariate models using stepwise regression, partial least squares and Bayesian artificial neural networks (ANN). The best predictive performance was obtained with ANN, with R-2= 0.62-0.69 for these descriptors using the complete dataset. Use of more complex Vsurf and ParaSurf descriptors showed little improvement over Molecular Operating Environment descriptors. The most influential descriptors in the ANN models, identified by automatic relevance determination, highlighted the importance of hydrophobicity, charge and molecular shape effects in these sorbate-sorbent interactions. The heterogeneous nature of the different sewage sludges used to measure K-d limited the predictability of sorption from physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals alone. Standardization of test materials for themeasurement of K-d would improve comparability of data from different studies, in the long-term leading to better quality environmental risk assessments.

AB The aquatic environment and drinking water production are under increasing pressure from the presence of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products in surface waters. Demographic developments and climate change result in increasing environmental concentrations, deeming abatement measures necessary. Here, we report on an extensive case study around the river Meuse and its tributaries in the south of The Netherlands. For the first time, concentrations in the tributaries were measured and their apportionment to a drinking water intake downstream were calculated and measured. Large variations, depending on the river discharge were observed. At low discharge, total concentrations up to 40 g/L were detected, with individual pharmaceuticals exceeding thresholds of toxicological concern and ecological water-quality standards. Several abatement options, like reorganization of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and additional treatment of wastewater or drinking water were evaluated. Abatement at all WWTPs would result in a good chemical and ecological status in the rivers as required by the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive. Considering long implementation periods and high investment costs, we recommend prioritizing additional treatment at the WWTPs with a high contribution to the environment. If drinking water quality is at risk, temporary treatment solutions in drinking water production can be considered. Pilot plant research proved that ultraviolet (UV) oxidation is a suitable solution for drinking water and wastewater treatment, the latter preferably in combination with effluent organic matter removal. In this way >95% of removal of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products can be achieved, both in drinking water and in wastewater. Application of UV/H2O2, preceded by humic acid removal by ion exchange, will cost about Euro0.23/m(3) treated water.

AB In a long term study, which covered 4 sampling periods over three years, a total number of 84 samples, specifically 28 influent, effluent, from seven WWTP located in the main cities along the Ebro river Basin (North East of Spain), as well as receiving river waters, were analyzed to assess the occurrence of 73 pharmaceuticals covering several medicinal classes. Results indicated that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in the aquatic environmental. Linking the calculation of removal rates with half-lives, assuming that compound degradation followed pseudo-first order kinetics, suggested that conventional wastewater treatments applied at the seven WWTP were unable to completely remove most of the pharmaceuticals under study. The evaluation of compound degradability, in terms of half-lives, is an important task to discuss integrated solutions for mitigation of pollutants entry into the water cycle. High half-lives observed for the majority of pharmaceuticals in WWTP suggest that, in order to enhance compound degradation, higher hydraulic retention times should be required. The wide spectrum of substances detected in receiving river waters indicates that WWTP outlets are major contributors of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. However, municipal wastewater treatment represents an obligatory and final treatment step prior to their release into the aquatic media, since load of pharmaceuticals in outlets were considerably reduced after treatment.
   Finally, hazard posed by pharmaceuticals in both surface and effluent wastewaters Was assessed toward different aquatic organisms, (algae, daphnids and fish). The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be algae > daphnia > fish. Results indicate that no significant risks could be associated to the presence of pharmaceuticals in those matrices, indicating that reduction of compound concentration after wastewater treatment as well as dilution factor once pharmaceuticals are discharged in receiving river water efficiently mitigate possible environmental hazards.

AB The raising pharmaceutical industrial wastewater (PIW) is one of the major health problems nowadays, not only for aquatic life but also for human beings and the environment. Several conventional techniques including coagulation, filtration, biological membranes and advanced oxidation have been used for the treatment of PIW, however, all of these techniques are limited with their applications and results. The present study aimed to build a cost-effective, high biodegradable, eco-friendly and highly efficient PIW treatment technique to generate electricity and reduce the COD of wastewater simultaneously. A novel paraboloid shaped graphite-based microbial fuel cell (MFC) configuration has been designed by eliminating different types of casings and membranes for bio-electrogenesis and treatment of PIW. Municipal solid wastewater (MSW) was used as a substrate for developing the biofilm in paraboloid graphite-based MFC. The PIW treatment showed adequate bioelectricity generation including; current, power, voltage and open-circuit voltage (OCV) of about 2.76 mA, 0.76 mW, 276 mV and 330 mV at 100 Omega respectively after five operating cycles. The cyclic voltammetry showed the maximum generation of 2.01 W/m(3) and 168 mA/m(2) of power and current densities respectively followed by a considerable reduction in internal resistance from 197 to 99 Omega. The results reported a significant amount of reduction in COD (80.55%) and TDS (35.62%) for PIW by MFC respectively. The reduction in the percentage removal efficiency of COD (80.55%) suggested that the removal of organic compounds from PIW is parallel to bioelectrogenesis. Based on these major findings the novel membrane-less and paraboloid graphite-based MFC operation significantly drag concentration towards the feasibility of using pharmaceutical wastewaters for bio-electrogenesis.

AB Although ozonation is nowadays recognized as one of the most efficient technologies for micropollutants abatement in municipal wastewater effluents, several of the compounds potentially present in those waters exhibit a strong resistance to direct ozone oxidation. In addition, the real-time control of the removal process is still challenging. In this work, the abatement of ozone-recalcitrant micropollutants during wastewater ozonation of six different wastewater effluents was explored using the pesticide acetamiprid as hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) probe. By means of this data, the oxidation efficiency (i. e., hydroxyl radical exposure per consumed ozone) could be described by means of a two-stage model based on the R-OHO3 concept. This was possible using a semicontinuous bubbling ozone contactor in all experiments, which permitted the inclusion of the ozone mass balance in the model. ROHO3 values of (1.53-7.60) center dot 10(-7) s for initial ozonation stage and (0.61-2.95) center dot 10(-6) s for the secondary stage were obtained allowing the characterization and comparison of the process performance in a wide range of effluent qualities, including water matrices with a high content of dissolved and particulate organic matter (total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and turbidity tested ranges: 6.7-50 mg C L-1, 6.6-27.6 mg C L-1 and 0.3-28.6 NTU, respectively). Finally, a surrogate strategy involving % OH exposure estimation by means of ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) measurements was proposed based on the R-OHO3 concept, and by means of its application the removal of atrazine and ibuprofen in six different wastewaters could be rightly predicted (R-2 > 0.98).

AB Treatment with non-thermal plasma (NTP) is a promisingmethod to remove potentially harmful pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent An application-oriented pilot-scale study was conducted to investigate the performance of an innovative process combining ultrafiltration (UF) and an NTP unit alternative to previously investigated thin-film designs. The studied NTP generator produces the plasma air separately and a specially designed turbine distributes the oxidizing species in the wastewater to be treated. The process was used for the treatment of effluents from a conventional activated sludge WWTP in Bad Reichenhall, Germany. Different set-ups in terms of hydraulic retention time and NTP composition (overall number of ions and ozone concentration) were tested to examine the removal efficiency of the target pharmaceuticals Diclofenac (DCF), Carbamazepine (CBM) and Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), as well as chemical and physical wastewater parameters. The reduction of DCF, CBM and SMX with optimal set-up was found to exceed 90% with initial concentrations in the WWTP effluent in the microgram per litre-range (0.80-15.15 mu g L-1). Traces of ozone in the range of 120/200 ppm within the NTP increased the overall performance of the process. Pre-treatment with UF removed fractions of pharmaceuticals and other oxidable substances, which led to a decrease in ozone demand and an enhancement of the overall removal efficiency of the process during varying influent loadings. Treatment via UF or NTP alone removed the pharmaceuticals by 46-67% and 54-71%, respectively, but did exceed the 90%-threshold. The studied NTP technology in combination with UF could be a viable as fourth treatment step, as it is highly energy-efficient, according to energy yield calculations, and larger amounts of wastewater can be treated.

AB Recently widespread usage of cephalosporin antibiotics in medical and veterinary fields has received growing attentions as severe contaminants of aquatic ecosystems. Since there is no report on the removal of cefazolin (CFZ) using electrocoagulation and adsorption (EC/AD) coupling treatment process, the present work deals with efficient removal of CFZ from hospital wastewater using EC/AD process. To achieve the optimal condition, response surface methodology (RSM) was applied successfully with the removal efficiency of 100% under optimal operating condition of 7.8 pH, 15.5 mA cm-2 current density, 60 mg L-1 initial CFZ concentration, 1.0 cm inter-electrode distance, 0.7 g L-1 chitosan dosage and electrolyte dose of 0.07 M NaCl within the equilibrium treatment time of 23 min which is in adequate agreement with the predicted model using analysis of variance. Kinetic and isotherm models were studied to figure out the exact mechanism of the CFZ removal. Kinetic studies revealed that the second-order model (R-2 = 0.9715) best fitted with the experimental results. Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 = 0.9851) predicted the maximum adsorption capacity of 1,250 mg g(-1). The obtained results suggested that charge neutralization of the negatively charged CFZ through binding with cationic hydrolysis products and sweep flocculation as the determinant mechanisms control the adsorption of CFZ molecules on aluminum hydroxide precipitates. Under the optimal condition, electrode consumption and electrical energy consumption were found to be 0.024 g during a single run and 1.251 kWh m(-3), respectively. The predicted treatment model for the synthetic wastewater is in satisfactory agreement with removal efficiency of the hospital wastewater.

AB In the present investigation, a microbial consortium consisting of four bacterial strains was selected for the treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater. The consortium was immobilized on a natural support matrix Luffa and used for the treatment of real-time pharmaceutical wastewater in batch and continuous processes. The batch process was carried out to optimize the culture conditions and monitor the enzymatic activity. An array of enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, monooxygenase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and hydroquinol 1,2-dioxygenase were produced by the consortium. The kinetics of the degradation in the batch process was analyzed and it was noted to be a first-order reaction. For the continuous study, an aerobic fixed-film bioreactor (AFFBR) was utilized for a period of 61 days with variable hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR). The immobilized microbes treated the wastewater by reducing the COD, phenolic contaminants and suspended solids. The OLR ranged between (0.56 +/- 0.05) kg COD.m(-3) d(-1) to 3.35 kg COD.m(-3).d(-1) and the system achieved an average reduction of 96.8% of COD, 92.6% of phenolic compounds and 95.2% of suspended solids. Kinetics of the continuous process was interpreted by three different models, where the modified Stover Kincannon model and the Grau second-order model proved to be best fit for the degradation reaction with the constant for saturation value, K-L being 95.12 g.L-1.d(-1), the constant for maximum utilization of the substrate U-max being 90.01 g.L-1 d(-1) and substrate removal constant K-Y was 1.074 d(-1) for both the models. GC-MS analysis confirmed that most of the organic contaminants were degraded into innocuous metabolites.

AB In the last few decades, the presence of pharmaceutical products in the environment is known under the name of emerging contaminants. These substances can enter the aquatic environment via different sources, as parent compounds, metabolites or a combination of both. In this work, we have investigated the presence of four pharmaceutical active compounds belonging to the group of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), in wastewater, surface water and drinking water of Algiers, which have a direct impact on the Mediterranean Sea. The target analytes (ibuprofen (IBU), naproxen (NAP), ketoprofen (KET), and diclofenac (DIC)), were extracted from the water samples by using Solid Phase Extraction Oasis (R) HLB Cartridges; the identification and quantification were realized by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC MS). To obtain the best resolution and precision, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was used as the derivatization reagent and ibuprofen-d(3) was used as the internal standard. The obtained recoveries were good, ranging from 82% for ketoprofen to 120% for naproxen with relatively small standard deviations (<= 20%). The target compounds were detected in wastewater, influent/effluent with concentrations ranging from 155.5 to 6554 ng/L, implicating removal efficiencies of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), between 30.3 and 95%. The surface water was also contaminated with pharmaceuticals from 72.9 ng/L for diclofenac to 228.3 ng/L for naproxen. In addition, the occurrence of ibuprofen and ketoprofen in drinking water, at concentrations of 142.1 and 110.9 ng/L, respectively, attracts concerns about possible impacts on human health.

AB BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that the pharmaceuticals detected in the influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can cause endocrine disruption and bacterial resistance on different species, in an aquatic environment. Metformin (antidiabetic drug) and ciprofloxacin (antibiotic quinolones) are compounds found at higher concentrations than many other pharmaceuticals, and thus have a disproportionately large environmental impact. This study is focused on the assessment of an aerated biofilter packed with Ficus benjamina wood chips for the simultaneous removal of metformin, ciprofloxacin, organic matter expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) during domestic wastewater treatment, under different superficial hydraulic loading. RESULTS The maximum removals of metformin, ciprofloxacin, COD and NH3-N from the wastewater treated in an aerated biofilter were 94, 81, 91 and 38%, respectively, by applying a superficial hydraulic loading of 0.18 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) [hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 h]. The adsorption capacity of F. benjamina wood chips on the metformin and ciprofloxacin was 0.1 and 2.03 mu g g(support material)(-1), respectively. CONCLUSION The maximum removal rates for metformin, ciprofloxacin, COD and NH3-N were obtained when the aerated biofilter was operated at HRT = 7 h. The F. benjamina wood chips showed sorption properties of pharmaceuticals. According to a scanning electron microscopy image, the F. benjamina wood chips showed available pores in their entire surface, thus indicating that this organic support medium has a high potential for carrying out the sorption processes. Likewise, the surface of the wood chips showed the development of a homogeneous biofilm. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Methamphetamine (MET) is one of the most used illicit drugs in Europe and is recognized as one of the Emerging Organic Micropollutants. It is discharged into the sewerage system from different sources and then enters the wastewater treatment plants. The present study aimed at providing a better knowledge of the fate of MET through the wastewater treatment plants. The study addressed two different issues: (1) optimization of the analytical methods for MET determination in both liquid and sludge phases, focusing on the effects of potentially interfering substances and (2) investigation on the behaviour of MET in the biological treatment process, with specific concern for the biomass activity at different drug concentrations. Results of the study on issue 1 highlighted that the applied analytical method for MET determination (UPLC-MS/MS) is affected by the main components of wastewater for about 9-23%, which is comparable with the uncertainties of the method (about +/- 28%). The method showed also to be repeatable and reliable (recovery >75%; repeatability <10-15%; bias uncertainty <30%), and relatively easy-to-use. Therefore, it can be considered suitable for measurements on routine base in the WWTPs. Batch tests conducted to address issue 2 showed total removal of 84, 90, and 96% at 50, 100, and 200ng/L initial MET concentration, respectively, for a contact time of 6h. The removal process was mainly ascribed to the biological activity of both heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria. The pseudo first-order kinetic model provided the best fitting of the experimental data of the overall biological processes at all the tested concentrations. Furthermore, the respirometric tests showed that MET does not induce any inhibition. Adsorption of MET on activated sludge was always very low.

AB This article presents the results of an investigation into the function of UV in a photo-assisted ozonation process for treatment of carbamazepine (CBZ) in treated domestic wastewaters. Experiments were conducted on synthetic spiked water and secondary treated municipal wastewater. Degradation of CBZ was studied for various combination of O-3 dosage ranging from 4.8 to 14.4mg/h and UV intensities with varying intensity and wavelength (UVC: =254nm and UVA: 352nm). In synthetic spiked water, CBZ was degraded to below detectable limits within 0.5min for ozone dose of 14.4mg/h. The rate of degradation of CBZ increased exponentially with increase in ozone dose following a zero-order rate at each dose level. The degradation rate of CBZ in wastewater was slower compared to deionized water (DI) water by 40-75% for various doses of ozone, presumably due to the presence of organic matter remaining in treated wastewater. Optimal UV intensities for UVA and UVC were obtained as 0.62 and 0.82mW/cm(2) for all doses of ozone in synthetic spiked water samples and UV intensities beyond this resulted in lower rates of degradation of CBZ. For photo-assisted ozonation with ozone doses of 9.6 and 14.4mg/L, rate constants were two times higher for UVA irradiations as compared to UVC irradiation. Contrary to observations in DI water, experiments in wastewater showed increase in rate of degradation with higher UV intensities. Overall, photo-assisted ozonation was found to be appropriate for both water and wastewater treatment by exploiting the benefit of direct attack of ozone and of produced (OH)-O-center dot radicals to yield a greater extent of mineralization of CBZ.

AB Two different methodologies were combined to evaluate the risks that antibiotics can pose in the environment; i) an effect-based methodology based on microbial growth inhibition and ii) an analytical method based on liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The first approach was adapted and validated for the screening of four antibiotic families, specifically macrolides/beta-lactams, quinolones, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. The LC-MS method was applied for the identification and quantification of target antibiotics; then, the obtained results were combined with ecotoxicological data from literature to determine the environmental risk. The two methodologies were used for the analysis of antibiotics in water samples (wastewater, river water and seawater) and biofluids (fish plasma and mollusk hemolymph) in two monitoring campaigns undertaken in the Ebro Delta and Mar Menor Lagoon (both in the Mediterranean coast of Spain). Both approaches highlighted macrolides (azithromycin) and quinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) as the main antibiotics in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents with potential risk for the environment. However, no risk for the aquatic life was identified in the river, lagoon and seawater as antibiotic levels were much lower than those in WWTP effluents. Fish from Ebro River were the organisms presenting the highest antibiotic concentration when compared with bivalves (mussels) from the Mediterranean Sea and gastropods (marine snails) from the Mar Menor Lagoon. The effect-based methodology successfully determined antibiotic risk in wastewater, but its applicability was less clear in environmental waters such as seawater, due to its high detection limits. Improving sample preconcentration could increase the method sensibility. Overall, combination of both methodologies provides comprehensive insights in antibiotic occurrence and risk associated in areas under study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An enhanced hydrolysis process has been proposed as a promising pretreatment method for removing high concentrations of antibiotics from production wastewater. Herein, the prediction of hydrolysis efficiency and reactive moieties of 14 fermentative antibiotics belonging to six classes were investigated at 85 degrees C under different pH conditions. Eight antibiotics (penicillin V, erythromycin, spiramycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, bacitracin, and colistin) could be hydrolyzed at 85 degrees C within 1 h. A semi-empirical prediction tool using the parameterized model number 3 method was established by making correlations between the enhanced hydrolysis efficiency and Delta E (the energy gap between the lowest unoccupied and highest occupied molecular orbitals (E-LUMO and E-HOMO)). Good negative correlations (R-2 = 0.452-0.884, p < 0.05) were obtained between Delta E and enhanced hydrolysis efficiency in the pH range of 3-11, and the predicted results were significantly close to their experimental values (R-2 = 0.802, p < 0.01) for the training and test sets. The tool was further verified by the density functional theory calculations, and showed that the Delta E of antibiotics was one of the key factors affecting the hydrolysis efficiency. The hydrolysis moieties of streptomycin and spectinomycin were determined to be the pseudoglycosidic bonds, streptose or hemiketal structures, which were related to the active antibacterial group. The antibacterial activity of actual production wastewater could be effectively destroyed with the enhanced hydrolysis process. More importantly, a full-scale wastewater treatment plant in an oxytetracycline factory in Hebei, China has already upgraded their systems by adopting the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, and 99.9% oxytetracycline removal was achieved. In general, this study could provide a useful tool in establishing a sound enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment strategy for different antibiotic production wastewaters.

AB Costs of water treatment can be reduced significantly if the spent adsorbents can be reused or regenerated. In this study, two residuals of iron adsorbed onto low-cost activated carbon (Fe-MCAC and Fe-MLAC) are reused as new adsorbents for the removal of ciprofloxacin (CIP) from pharmaceuticals wastewater. The residuals were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectra and N2-adsorption desorption. The adsorption mechanisms, performance, kinetics, isotherm, thermodynamic and reusability of residuals for CIP removal were evaluated. The isotherm data were well defined by the Freundlich model for both adsorbents (residuals). Moreover, the CIP adsorption follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The maximum adsorption capacity of CIP on Fe-MCAC and Fe-MLAC was 476.19 and 416.67 mg/g, respectively. The maximum removal of CIP was obtained at pH 7 for both new adsorbents. The optimum contact time was found to be 30 and 60 min for Fe-MCAC and Fe-MLAC, respectively. The values of free energy change and enthalpy change for adsorption of CIP indicated the spontaneous, endothermic nature of the adsorption. In addition, the adsorption process was assisted by increasing randomness due to the value of entropy change. Therefore, the residuals of iron adsorption onto activated carbons could be reused as new low-cost adsorbents for antibiotics removal from wastewater.

AB Complete mineralisation of reaction intermediates refractory towards hydroxyl radical, generated from a previous ineffective degradation of urban wastewater containing antipyrine by HO center dot-mediated sonophoto-Fenton reaction, has been attained using persulfate anions simultaneously activated by heat energy (thermally, ultrasound) and UV-C light The SO4 center dot--based mineralisation process enables another reaction pathway generating more easy degradable derivatives. The influences of the initial concentration of persulfate, ultrasound amplitude, temperature and the reaction time in the previous HO center dot-based previous oxidation on the mineralisation degree were studied by using a Central-Composite Experimental Design. Under optimal conditions ([S2O82-](0) = 1200 mg L-1, temperature = 50 degrees C, amplitude = 10%, pH 2.8, HO center dot-based reaction time = 25 min) practically complete degradation was achieved in approximately 120 min. The contribution of HO center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals in this system was also evaluated. The presence of chloride ion in urban wastewater can benefit the oxidation of acetate by sulfate radical. Results demonstrated that this activated persulfate-based oxidation system is a potential alternative to degrade intermediate compounds, which are refractory against hydroxyl radicals, generated in Advanced Oxidation Processes used to treat wastewater containing emerging contaminants such as antipyrine.

AB In this paper, one pot-economical approach for in-situ modification of enoxacin (EXC) imprinted nanocomposite membrane was developed by employing carbon nanosphere sol (CNS) as coagulation bath during phase inversion process for increasingly antifouling property. Using polydopamine (pDA) as hydrophilic coating layer and second-reaction platform, the CNS based biomimetic molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (CBMIMs) were then obtained which used EXC as the target molecule for specific adsorption and separation EXC from the sewage. The imprinting polymer layer was highly hydrophilic, which advanced antifouling performance to avoid the adsorption of contaminant protein. Using EXC as template, the optimal fabrication conditions on performances and properties of CBMIMs were studied. Isothermal adsorption curves, adsorption kinetics and rebinding selectivity were investigated to well explain the selectivity adsorption mechanism of imprinted membranes on EXC. The CBMIMs presented highly selective specificity, short kinetic equilibrium time and preferable rebinding capacity for EXC. The rebinding ability and imprinted factor (beta) of CBMIMs could reach 32.10 mg g(-1) and 3.15, respectively, which presented various highly favorable features, including high rebinding strength and excellent selective performance. Furthermore, the adsorption of actual environmental sewage by CBMIMs was investigated, which highlighted the advantage of CBMIMs. Several favorable performances of CBMIMs also provided further application for sewage treatment in the future.

AB Even though there is increasing evidence on the benefits of combining electro-Fenton (EF) and anodic oxidation with boron doped diamond anodes (BDD) for the degradation of organic pollutants, the exact contribution of % OH, BDD(center dot OH) and their synergy in the paired EF-BDD process has still not been clearly established, taking into account i) the applied current/potential; ii) the reactivity of the pollutants and their intermediates formed during treatment and; iii) the matrix effect in real wastewater. In this paper, we address the above points by conducting the EF treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater (COD0 = 1200 mg L-1 and BOD5/COD = 0.14). In-depth data analysis revealed a synergy between homogeneous and heterogeneous BDD(%OH) that accelerated the mineralization of organics, with homogeneous %OH dominating during the first treatment stages, while BDD prevailed in the last stages through electron transfer reactions. EF-BDD achieved the highest mineralization yield (97.1% of TOC removal at 4.17 mA cm(-2) and 0.2 mM of Fe2+), as compared to EF with a dimensionally stable anode (DSA), a material not producing heterogeneous center dot OH. However, EF-DSA proved equally effective at increasing the biodegradability of the effluent with lower operational costs (BOD5/COD = 0.68 at US$ 1.46 m(-3) in 4 h). Hence, we point out the versatility of EF to reach different targets of water quality depending upon the anode materials: EF-DSA to increase the biodegradability of refractory wastewater vs. more powerful (though costlier) EF-BDD for quasi-complete mineralization.

AB Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) have been detected in drinking water sources for several years, raising concerns due to their potential risks to public health. The main contributor of TOrCs to drinking water is through wastewater discharges. However, there are several hundred TOrCs currently known with numerous new organic chemicals being released daily, making it unfeasible to monitor each one in water. This study used a detailed literature review and scoring system to establish a list of twenty priority indicator TOrCs in US wastewaters. Next, a rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS method for analysis of these compounds was developed without the need for an extraction step and only 80 mu L sample volume while providing method reporting limits of 3-39 ng L-1 for all but one TOrC (sucralose: 302 ng L-1). The elimination of an extraction step reduced matrix effects considerably making the method suitable for wastewater analysis. Method validation including matrix spike recoveries, linearity of calibration curve and inter- and intra-day variability was successfully performed. Finally, the twenty indicator TOrCs were evaluated in four different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents through four sample campaigns spread across a year. The occurrence data indicated that all indicator TOrCs were detected in at least three out of the four WWTP effluents. Sucralose, iohexol, TCPP, acesulfame and gemfibrozil were detected in all samples at the four WWTPs indicating they could be used as indicators of wastewater influence in receiving waters. DEET, caffeine, triclosan, iopromide and others are effective indicators at showing seasonal variations, treatment process efficacy, and consumption patterns. Overall, the impact of this study will help develop more effective monitoring programs for TOrCs in water reuse schemes.

AB A novel multifunctional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 (UiO = University of Oslo) was fabricated to adsorb pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) under near neutral conditions. We designed a wrinkle structure on the surface of UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 by seeded growth strategy. These wrinkles were composed of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and outermost UiO-66. It made the specific surface area of the MOFs increases, and provided multiple active sites for a representative pollutant salicylic acid (SA) adsorption. Moreover, lattice defects formed during secondary growth facilitating the coordination interaction between SA and the secondary building unit of UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 under near neutral conditions. These advantages made the adsorption capacity of per unit mass UiO-66 in UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 about 42% higher than that of the pristine UiO-66, and the removal rate of 1 mg L-1 SA reach 64.5% in real wastewater. Furthermore, magnetic Fe3O4 particles in the wrinkles exhibited outstanding magnetic separation performance. So that UiO-66@Fe3O4@UiO-66 can be effectively separated from the liquid media and regenerated after adsorption. The results show that the wrinkled MOFs could be used as an excellent candidate for SA adsorption in real wastewater. More importantly, this strategy could guide the preparation of different kind of MOFs to adsorb PPCPs in wastewater.

AB To better understand the environmental mobility of sulfonamide antibiotics and develop improved processes for their removal during wastewater treatment, stirred cell ultrafiltration (UF) experiments were conducted using both synthetic and real wastewater effluent. The interactions between selected sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfathiazole and sulfamerazine), solids and dissolved organic matter were systematically explored. The further impact of micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF), a process in which surfactants are added at micellar concentrations to enhance removal of various trace contaminants from aqueous streams, was then explored by using a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Ultrafiltration of sulfonamides in the absence of other materials generally removed only 15-20% of the antibiotics. The presence of micellar solutions of CTAB generally improved removal of sulfonamides over UF alone, with rejections ranging from 20 to 74%. Environmental solids (sediment) further increased retention of sulfonamides using both UF and MEUF, but the presence of DOM did not influence rejection. Similar trends were observed on UF and MEUF of real effluent samples that had been spiked with the sulfonamides, confirming the environmental relevance of the observed interactions between sulfonamides, surfactant, and wastewater constituents. The results demonstrate that MEUF processes can be designed for the selective removal of such trace contaminants as sulfonamide antibiotics. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to eliminate micropollutants from wastewater, the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) is a suitable and common technique. Many studies already proved the successful elimination of micropollutants from wastewater using PAC. However, it still remains a challenge to completely retain the applied PAC within the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) without considerable emission of PAC into receiving waters. The present study investigates possible toxic effects of micropollutant-loaded PAC from a WWTP in acute and chronic tests with the aquatic organism Daphnia magna. Furthermore, the well-studied micropollutant diclofenac as well as unloaded, native PAC and experimentally diclofenac-loaded PAC were tested. The acute tests resulted in median effect concentrations (EC50) after 48 h of 53 mg/L for diclofenac, 217 mg/L for native PAC and 414 mg/L for diclofenac-loaded PAC. No effects were detected for the loaded PAC from the WWTP although D. magna ingested the PAC. The chronic tests revealed that diclofenac had effects on growth, reproduction and mortality (median lethal concentration 17.0 mg/L). Exposure to native and diclofenac-loaded PAC showed clear effects on growth and a reproduction inhibition of 80% in the highest tested concentrations. The calculated reproduction EC10 values were 0.8 mg/L for native PAC and 0.3 mg/L for diclofenac-loaded PAC. For the loaded PAC from the WWTP, no effects were observed on reproduction, growth and mortality during the 21-day exposure albeit the fact that the animals ingested the PAC into their gastrointestinal system. Based on these findings PAC from WWTP can be considered as not harmful to D. magna even if complete retention of the PAC at the WWTP cannot be guaranteed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid electrocatalytic ozonation is an efficient method for degrading high-salinity organic wastewater that has excellent oxidation ability and is environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the high salt content of the wastewater provides electrolyte to support the process, which avoids secondary pollution caused by the addition of electrolyte. In this work, Ni-0.2-Ce-0.2/ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)/granular active carbon (GAC) particle electrodes with a Ni:Ce weight ratio of 1:1 were synthesized using a simple method. The electrodes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as other techniques. The catalytic performance was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance. Higher reduction and oxidation peak currents were obtained with the Ni-0.2-Ce-0.2/OMC catalyst than with Ni-0.2/OMC or Ce-0.2/OMC, indicating that the bimetallic catalyst has higher activity for the reduction of O-2 to H2O2 and the oxidation of O-3 to center dot OH. The order of the k values-which represent the mass-transfer rate-was Ni-0.2-Ce-0.2/OMC (0.157) > Ni-0.2/OMC (0.017) > Ce-0.2/OMC (0.014). The results show that cooperation between Ni, Ce, and OMC promoted the dispersion of Ni and Ce and improved the catalytic performance. Ni-0.2-Ce-0.2/OMC enhances the catalytic reduction of O-2 to H2O2, and, in addition, Ce is able to rapidly store and release oxygen through Ce3+/Ce4+ conversions and reacting with O-3 to generate center dot OH, which increases the oxidation capacity of the material. Under the optimal conditions the chemical oxygen demand removal for high-salinity organic wastewater using Ni-0.2-Ce-0.2/OMC/GAC particle electrodes reached 93.7%.<bold> </bold>

AB The aim of this study was to produce optimal wastewater treatment solutions to calculate the removal of different contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) found in developing countries. A new methodology was developed for a decision support tool (WaStewater Decision support OptiMiser, WiSDOM), which focuses on producing treatment solutions suited to treating water for reuse to Indian Water Quality Standards. WiSDOM-CEC analyses the removal of CECs through different treatment solutions and was also used to evaluate the performance of each treatment train solution in terms of the removal of conventional pollutants using multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision analysis. Information was collected on different CECs across different regions of India, and the removal of 18 different CECs through 42 wastewater treatment unit processes for five different regions of India was analysed. Comparisons between similar categories of CECs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, showed that emerging contaminants all react differently with individual treatment options. For example, the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NPX) varied from >80% and 0%, respectively, for a solution in Karnataka involving sedimentation, submerged aerated filter, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. In Tamil Nadu, results ranged from 36.8% to 72% for diclofenac, 10.7% to 66.5% for IBP, and 0% for NPX.

AB Batch experiments were conducted for advanced treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater (after biological treatment) in a series of Fenton-like systems. Fe3O4-H2O2 system had the highest reactivity for COD removal comparing to classic Fenton and Fe-0-H2O2 systems. Effects of crucial experimental factors were investigated, including H2O2 and Fe3O4 dosage, pH, and reaction time. To reach 20% COD removal, the optimal conditions were pH of 3.0, Fe3O4 dosage of 1.0 g/L, and H2O2 dosage of 10 mg/L. Comparing with the classical Fenton's reaction, the Fe3O4-H2O2 system saved 75% H2O2, reduced 47% excess sludge, and slightly improved the COD removal. Furthermore, in order to meet the upcoming new local standard, Fe2+ and Fe-0 were introduced into Fe3O4-H2O2 system to form a hybrid system, Fe3O4/Fe-0/Fe2+-H2O2 (pH of 3.0, Fe3O4 of 1.0 g/L, Fe-0 of 0.23 g/L, Fe2+ of 34 mg/L, and H2O2 of 40 mg/L). Fe-0 and Fe2+ not only improved the COD removal and decreased iron sludge, but also enhanced the reuse of catalysts. Compared to the classic Fenton process, 80% H2O2 dosage was saved and 94% iron sludge was decreased. Meanwhile, the cost decrease by 1.66 RMB/m(3)-wastewater.

AB Ozonation followed by ultrafiltration (O-3 + UF) was employed at pilot scale for the treatment of secondary urban wastewater, envisaging its safe reuse for crop irrigation. Chemical contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and priority substances (PSs), microbial load, estrogenic activity, cell viability and cellular metabolic activity were measured before and immediately after O-3 + UF treatment. The microbial load was also evaluated after one-week storage of the treated water to assess potential bacteria regrowth. Among the organic micropollutants detected, only citalopram and isoproturon were not removed below the limit of quantification. The treatment was also effective in the reduction in the bacterial loads considering current legislation in water quality for irrigation (i.e., in terms of enterobacteria and nematode eggs). However, after seven days of storage, total heterotrophs regrew to levels close to the initial, with the concomitant increase in the genes 16S rRNA and intI1. The assessment of biological effects revealed similar water quality before and after treatment, meaning that O-3 + UF did not produce detectable toxic by-products. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that the wastewater treated with this technology comply with the water quality standards for irrigation, even when stored up to one week, although improvements must be made to minimise microbial overgrowth.

AB While pharmaceuticals are now routinely detected in aquatic environments, we know little of the biological activity their presence might provoke. It is estimated that nearly 40% of all marketed pharmaceuticals are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) acting pharmaceuticals. Here, we applied an in-vitro assay, called the TGF alpha shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of GPCRs-acting pharmaceuticals present in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan from 2014 to 2016. The results indicated that compounds were present in the wastewater with antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (beta 1), acetylcholine (M1), and histamine (H1) receptors in both countries. The most consistent and powerful antagonistic activity was against the H1, D2, and AT1 receptors at up to microgram-antagonist-equivalent quantity/L. Chemical analysis of the same UK samples was also conducted in parallel. Comparing the results of the bioassay with the chemical analysis indicated (1) the existence of other D2 or M1 receptor antagonists besides sulpiride (D2 antagonist) or pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) in wastewater and (2) that there might be a mixture effect between agonist and antagonistic activities against beta 1 receptor. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be paid more attention in the environmental monitoring and toxicity testing in future studies.

AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater must be pretreated before traditional biological treatment to improve the biodegradability of pollutants due to their high concentration and complex composition. This study investigated O-3 and O-3/H2O2 systems to pretreat hydrocortisone wastewater. The optimum treatment efficiency of the O-3 system was achieved under pH value of 5.76, dosage of O-3 of 217.5 mg/L, and reaction time of 90 min. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) was 94% and 92%, respectively. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) increased from 0.066 to 0.310. Moreover, the optimum H2O2/O-3 molar ratio was 0.3 with the optimum pH of 3, and reaction time was reduced to 15 min to reach COD removal efficiency of 67.3% in the O-3/H2O2 oxidation system. Interestingly, isobutanol was assumed to be a good hydroxyl radical trapping agent due to the great decrease of Fenton reagent reaction rate constant. By comparing two different kinetic models, oxidation mechanism could be interpreted by the pseudo first-order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient R-2 above 0.9787. It can be concluded that ozonation system was controlled by both direct oxidation and free radical oxidation, and particularly the later one played a dominant role.

AB The cholesterol-lowering pharmaceutical gemfibrozil is a relevant environmental contaminant because of its frequency of detection in U.S. wastewaters at concentrations which have been shown to disrupt endocrine function in aquatic species. The treatment of gemfibrozil solutions with sodium hypochlorite yielded a 4'-chlorinated gemfibrozil analog (chlorogemfibrozil). In the presence of bromide ion, as is often encountered in municipal wastewater, hypobromous acid generated through a halogen exchange reaction produced an additional 4'-brominated gemfibrozil product (bromogemfibrozil). Standards of chloro- and bromogemfibrozil were synthesized, isolated and characterized using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to follow the in situ halogenation reaction of gemfibrozil in deionized water and wastewater matrices, and to measure levels of gemfibrozil (254 +/- 20 ng/L), chlorogemfibrozil (166 +/- 121 ng/L), and bromogemfibrozil (50 +/- 11 ng/L) in advanced primary wastewater treatment effluent treated by chlorination. Chlorogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of 11-ketotestosterone at 55.1 mu g/L and bromogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of testosterone at 58.8 mu g/L in vivo in Japanese medaka in a 21 day exposure. These results indicated that aqueous exposure to halogenated degradates of gemfibrozil enhanced the antiandrogenicity of the parent compound in a model fish species, demonstrating that chlorination may increase the toxicity of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water.

AB A mixture of urban and hospital effluents (50 % v/v) was evaluated for ecotoxicity with an advanced bioassay battery. Mixed effluents were tested before any treatment, after biological treatment alone, and after biological treatment followed by a tertiary ozonation (15 mg O-3/L). Laying a high value on the continuance of organisms' fitness, essential to preserve a healthy receiving ecosystem, the main objective of this study was to combine normalized bioassays with newly developed in vivo and in vitro tests in order to assess alteration of embryo development, growth and reproduction, as well as genotoxic effects in aquatic organisms exposed to complex wastewater effluents. Comparison of the bioassays sensitivity was considered. Contrary to the lack of toxicity observed with normalized ecotoxicity tests, endpoints measured on zebrafish embryos such as developmental abnormalities and genotoxicity demonstrated a residual toxicity in wastewater both after a biological treatment followed or not by a tertiary O-3 treatment. However, the ozonation step allowed to alleviate the residual endocrine disrupting potential measure in the biologically treated effluent. This study shows that normalized bioassays are not sensitive enough for the ecotoxicological evaluation of wastewaters and that there is a great need for the development of suitable sensitive bioassays in order to characterize properly the possible residual toxicity of treated effluents.

AB Biological treatment of saline wastewater is considered unfavorable due to salinity inhibition on microbial activity. In this study, intertidal wetland sediment (IWS) collected from a high saline environment Was investigated: as a novel inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline pharmaceutical wastewater. Two parallel lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR) were set up to compare the organic removal potential of IWS with conventional anaerobic digested sludge (ADS). Under steady-state condition, IWS reactor (R-i) showed organic reduction performance significantly superior to that of ADS reactor (R-a), achieving COD removal efficiency of 71.4 +/- 3.7 and 32.3 +/- 6.1%, respectively. In addition, as revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, a higher relative abundance of methanogenic populations was detected in R-i. A further 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing test was conducted to understand both the bacterial and archaeal community populations in the two AnSBRs. A predominance of halophilic/tolerant microorganisms (class Clostridia of bacteria, genera Methanosarcina, and Methanohalophilus of archaea) in R-i enhanced its organic removal, efficiency. Moreover, several Microbial groups related with degradation of hardly biodegradable compounds (PAHs, n-alkenes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alkanes, etc.) were detected in the IWS. All these findings indicated that IWS is a promising inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline wastewater.

AB The transmission and toxicity of metals and metalloids were initially investigated with various nanofiltration (NF) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, under oxic condition, using wastewater effluent and seawater samples. Various metals and metalloids were categorized into three groups according to their properties, such as specific gravity and concentration level, as well as others. The levels of various transition metals and metalloids included in the wastewater effluent and seawater samples were within ng/L-mu g/L range; the concentrations of almost all compounds were substantially reduced to ng/L or a few mu g/L levels after membrane filtrations, as measured by ICP-MS. Toxicity measurements were performed using bioassays, including both the Microtox and daphnia methods, for raw and membrane treated samples of wastewater effluent and seawater. The results indicated that (1) the SWRO membrane exhibited very good removal efficiencies for all metals and metalloids tested, (2) most metals and metalloids tested were efficiently removed by the tight NF membranes employed; however, some metals and metalloids included in seawater were not efficiently removed by the relatively loose NF membrane, (3) based on the Microtox measurements, only the seawater sample treated using the relatively loose NF membrane provided a relatively high toxic unit close to 1.0; otherwise, all other samples (both raw and membrane treated samples) exhibited relatively low toxicities.

AB The persistence of acesulfame (ACE) in wastewater treatment (and subsequently the aquatic environment) has led to its use as a marker substance for wastewater input into surface water and groundwater. However, ACE degradation of >85% during summer and autumn was observed in nine German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Annual removal performance was more stable in larger plants, enhanced by low biological oxygen demand and impeded by water temperatures below 10 degrees C. Literature data suggest that the potential to degrade ACE emerged in WWTPs around the year 2010. This development is ongoing, as illustrated by ACE content in the German rivers Elbe and Mulde: Between 2013 and 2016 the ACE mass load decreased by 70-80%. In enrichment cultures with ACE as sole carbon source the carbonaceous fraction of ACE was removed completely, indicating catabolic biotransformation and the inorganic compound sulfamic acid formed in quantitative amounts. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes suggests that several species are involved in ACE degradation, with proteobacterial species affiliated to Phyllobacteriaceae, Methylophilaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Pseudomonas becoming specifically enriched. ACE appears to be the first micropollutant for which the evolution of a catabolic pathway in WWTPs has been witnessed. It can yet only be speculated whether the emergence of ACE removal in WWTPs in different regions of the world is due to independent evolution or to global spreading of genes or adapted microorganisms.
