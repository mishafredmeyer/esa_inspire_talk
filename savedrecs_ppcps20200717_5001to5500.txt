AB The use of cytotoxic substances, such as 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, is carefully controlled; however, these medications may still enter bodies of water through wastewater discharge. These substances may pose risks to stream and river life, as well as to humans via drinking water. In this study, the photochemical fate of 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide was investigated in synthetic waters and four river waters and was found to be the most important attenuation process for each entity in natural surface waters. Bicarbonate alone was found to react with the excited states of 5-fluorouracil, thus enhancing direct photolysis rates. In the presence of nitrate and significant amounts of bicarbonate (close to 2 mM), 5-fluorouracil was rapidly removed (within 1 day) through indirect photolysis. In contrast, natural attenuation was of low importance for cyclophosphamide in most surface waters studied. A long, shallow river or lake with a long residence time (>7 days), very low alkalinity, and significant nitrate levels (>5 mg-N L-1) may be an exception. The phototransformation product of 5-fluorouracil was also identified. However, the total organic carbon experiments yielded important results: photolysis resulted in quick transformation of 5-fluorouracil but minimal mineralization. Additional studies of the toxicity of photobyproducts of 5-fluorouracil are needed to determine the true risk to human health of 5-fluorouracil contamination of surface water, given its near-total photodegradation and resultant, deceptively low detection rate in surface waters.

AB In the last years many papers have reported about the occurrence of the pharmaceuticals in the surface waters and their undesirable effects upon the aquatic life. Most of pharmaceuticals pass through the wastewater treatment plants unchanged because they are biorefractory compounds and as a result they enter the water bodies. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals effluents (PhEs) before their discharge in the sewerage systems. The aim of this paper was the use of Dimensionally Stable Anodes (DSA) to improve the biodegradability of PhE containing diclofenac (DCF) as pharmaceutically active compound. The refractory character of PhE was found based on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio (R) value of 0.05. The DSA electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition of the appropriate precursors and had the composition Ti/RuO2-TiO2. Besides electrochemical experiments, photoassisted electrochemical, and combined photocatalytic and electrochemical experiments were carried out. The three DSA-based methods were effective for the biodegradability improvement of the PhE. The best result for R was 0.62, which was obtained for the combined photocatalytic and electrochemical method. These promising results regarding the biodegradability improvement of PhE should constitute the base for future detailed researches involving the DSA use for the wastewater treatment.

AB In the present study, a method for prediction of the toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics to microbial communities in anaerobic digestion treatment was developed. Luminescent bacterium assay was carried out with Vibrio fischeri as indicator. The individual and joint toxicities of antibiotics and anaerobic digestion metabolites were investigated by using the 15-min half inhibitory concentration (15 min-IC50) at pH 7.00 +/- 0.05. The results showed that the 15 min-IC50 of Amoxicillin, Kanamycin, Lincomycin and Ciprofloxacin were 3.99, 5.11, 4.32 and 5.63 g L-1 respectively, and the toxicity descended in the order of Amoxicillin, Lincomycin, Kanamycin and Ciprofloxacin. Using equitoxic ratio mixing method, the joint toxicities of four anaerobic digestion intermediates, the four intermediates together with Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Kanamycin or Lincomycin were determined, which displayed that their interactions were additive, additive, synergistic, synergistic and synergistic respectively. Finally the joint effect of all intermediates and antibiotics was synergistic. The method has promising applications in evaluating the joint toxicity of anaerobic digestion intermediates and antibiotics, and has laid the foundations for assessing the feasibility of anaerobic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater containing antibiotics.

AB Wetlands constitute one of the most efficient ecosystems with a great capacity to recycle the organic matter and able to attenuate or mitigate the chemical pollution. However, limited information exists on the ecotoxicological effects that may be caused due to the presence of these pollutants in wetland sediments. In this work, a bioassay-directed approach was used to identify toxicologically active compounds retained in sediments from a surface flow constructed wetland located in the North-Eastern of Spain. Sediment fractionation was accomplished by pressurized-liquid extraction (PLE) followed by semipreparative normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC). During the extraction procedure, different solvents were sequentially applied in order to selectively extract the compounds as a function of their polarity. The cytotoxicity of the resulting fractions was assessed on the fish hepatoma cell line PLHC-1 by using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, while the presence of CYP1A inducing agents was determined by measuring the activity 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in exposed cells. Identification of the compounds was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), polycyclic musk fragrances and pesticides were identified in the most toxic fractions.

AB Antibiotics (sulfonamides and tetracyclines) have attractive increasing attention due to their persistence for a long time, which lead to concern of widespread antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes in the aquatic environment. Investigation of the occurrence and elimination of antibiotics in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is thus imperative. This paper presents the method development of the liquid chromatography-ion-trap mass spectrometer (IT-MS)-time-of-flight mass spectrometer in series (LC-IT-ToF/MS) hybrid technique to determine concentrations of sulfonamides and tetracyclines in the effluent of animal WWTP. Detection limits of the developed method were 22.8, 23.0, 25.8, 23.6, and 9.8 ng L-1 for sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline, respectively. Average recovery efficiencies of the method for sulfonamides fortified in effluent samples of ananimal WWTP at 1.0, and 4.0 mu g L-1 were 73-95%, and 89-104%, respectively, while that of the method for tetracyclines fortified at 0.4 and 4.0 mu g L-1 was 76-104%, and 101-107%, respectively. The analysis of effluent of the WWTP showed that more than 90% of analyzed antibiotics were removed by the treatment consisted of biological, a UF membrane, and a coagulation process. The maximum concentrations of sulfonamide and tetracycline in the WWTP were 49.5 and 4.1 mu g L-1, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Amoxicillin (AMX) is a widely used penicillin-type antibiotic whose presence in the environment has been widely investigated, despite its rapid hydrolysis to various degradation products (DPs). In this work, the formation of AMX DPs was studied in various aqueous solutions containing 100 mu g mL(-1) AMX. Three phosphate buffer solutions, at pH 5, pH 7 and pH 8, and a fourth buffer solution at pH 7 with the addition of the bivalent ions Mg2+ and Ca-2 as chelating agents, were examined under controlled environmental conditions. In addition, two solutions from natural sources were examined secondary effluents and tap water. The obtained DPs were identified by their MS/MS, UV and NMR spectra (obtained from pure compounds isolated by preparative HPLC) as: AMX penicilloic acid (ADP1/2), AMX penilloic acid (ADP4/5) and phenol hydroxypyrazine (ADP6). Two additional detected DPs AMX 2',5'-diketopiperazine (ADP8/9), and AMX-S-oxide (ADP3) were reported and discussed in our previous publications. These DPs were then detected in secondary effluent and groundwater from a well located beneath agricultural fields continuously irrigated with secondary effluent. Concentrations in the secondary effluent were: ADP1/2, several micrograms per liter; ADP4/5, 0.15 mu g L-1, and ADP8/9, 0.5 mu g L-1. ADP6 were detected but not quantified. In the groundwater, only ADP8/9 was detected, at a concentration of 0.03 mu g L-1. The detection and quantification of DPs of other investigated drugs is recommended as an integral part of any study, method or technique dealing with pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments.

AB Sertraline is a widely-used antidepressant that is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It has been detected in biosolids and effluents from sewage treatment plants. Since sertraline can reach agriculture land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water, the persistence and dissipation pathways of H-3-sertraline were determined in laboratory incubations using three agriculture soils varying in textures and properties. The total solvent extractable radioactivity decreased in all three soils with times to dissipate 50% of material (DT50) ranging from 48.1 +/- 3.5 (loam soil) to 84.5 +/- 13.8 (clay soil) days. Two hydroxylated sertraline transformation products were identified in all three soils by high performance liquid chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS), but the accumulation did not exceed 10% of the initial parent concentration. The addition of liquid municipal biosolids to the loam soil had no effect on the rate of sertraline dissipation, or production of transformation products. In summary, sertraline was persistent in agricultural soils with major dissipation pathways including the production of non-extractable soil-bound residues, and accumulation of hydroxylated transformation products. The biologically active sertraline transformation product norsertraline was not detected in soil. Crown Copyright (C), 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantitative analysis of human urinary metabolites as biomarkers in wastewater streams has been used to estimate the rates of illicit drug use in the wider community. The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The activated sludge modelling framework for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these compounds is considered.

AB This study investigated the degradation of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol beta-blockers by ferrate (K2FeO4) in hospital wastewater and in aqueous solution. In the case of hospital wastewater, the effect of the independent variables pH and [Fe(VI)] was evaluated by means of response surface methodology. The results showed that Fe(VI) plays an important role in the oxidation-coagulation process, and the treatment of the hospital wastewater led to degradations above 90% for all the three beta-blockers, and to reductions of aromaticity that were close to 60%. In addition, only 17% of the organic load was removed. In aqueous solution, the degradation of the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol was 71.7%, 24.7% and 96.5%, respectively, when a ratio of 1:10 [beta-blocker]:[Fe(VI)] was used. No mineralization was achieved, which suggests that there was a conversion of the beta-blockers to degradation products identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tandem. Degradation pathways were proposed, which took account of the role of Fe(VI). Furthermore, the ready biodegradability of the post-process samples was evaluated by using the closed bottle test, and showed an increase in biodegradability. The use of the ferrate advanced oxidation technology seems to be a useful means of ensuring the remediation of hospital and similar wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently detected human pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and biosolids. Soil is a primary environmental compartment receiving CBZ through wastewater irrigation and biosolid application. In this study, we explored the transformation of CBZ to biologically active intermediates in soil. Both C-14 labeling and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to track transformation kinetics and identify major degradation intermediates. Through 120 days of incubation under aerobic conditions, mineralization of CBZ did not exceed 2% of the spiked rate in different soils. Amendment of biosolids further suppressed mineralization. The fraction of non-extractable (i.e., bound) residue also remained negligible (<5%). On the other hand, CBZ was transformed to a range of degradation intermediates, including 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, acridone-N-carbaldehyde, 4-aldehyde-9-acridone, and acridine, of which acridone-N-carbaldehyde was formed in a large fraction and appeared to be recalcitrant to further degradation. Electrocyclization, ring cleavage, hydrogen shift, carbonylation, and decarbonylation contributed to CBZ transformative reactions in soil, producing biologically active products. The persistence of the parent compound and formation of incomplete intermediates suggest that CBZ has a high risk for off-site transport from soil, such as accumulation into plants and contamination of groundwater.

AB The extraction and stripping of silver ions by hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) was examined. Pharmaceutical wastewater containing 30 mg/dm(3) of silver ions was used as the feed solution. LIX 84-I dissolved in kerosene, and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate solution were used as the liquid membrane and stripping solution, respectively. The influences of several variables on the extraction and stripping of silver ions were investigated. Fluid-flow models for greater accuracy in describing the transport of silver ions from feed phase to stripping phase were developed. The models were calculated by linear algebra. The investigated parameters in the models were axial convections and axial diffusions on both sides, chemical reactions at the feed-liquid membrane and liquid membrane-stripping interfaces as well as the accumulation of silver ions in the system. The mass transfer coefficient in the liquid membrane (k(m)) was determined for use in the models. The final predicted concentrations of silver ions in feed and stripping phases were successfully in agreement with the experimental data. It indicates that the fluid-flow model can accurately estimate the transport of silver ions inside and outside the hollow fibers corresponding to the axial convections, axial diffusions, reactions at the feed-liquid membrane and liquid membrane-stripping interfaces. In accordance with this investigation, the HFSLM shows a practical implication for the use in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication use is on the rise in the United States. The most widely used ADHD medications are the amphetamine-type compounds Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts) and Ritalin (methylphenidate). According to survey data ADHD medications are used as a study drug or "Smart Drug" by students without a prescription on college campuses. Survey data of non-prescribed drug use has limitations with accurate reporting and no empirical data of usage exists in the literature. This study looks for trends in the use of these drugs on a college campus among low-stress and high stress periods. The metabolites of these two drugs, amphetamine and ritalinic acid, are quantified in campus wastewater using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Trends show a possible increase in amphetamine levels during periods of high stress such as midterms, the last week of classes and finals week over levels from the baseline low stress weeks such as the first week of classes. Both semesters from the 2011-12 academic year were studied and the highest increase over baseline (760%) occurred during finals week of the second semester. Ritalinic acid levels gradually climbed first semester but had no obvious periodic trend second semester. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ofloxacin (OFL), a broad-spectrum and widespread-used photolabile fluoroquinolone, is frequently found in treated wastewaters, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems leading to increasing concern during the past decades regarding its effects to the environment and human health. The elimination of OFL and other xenobiotics by the application of advanced oxidation processes using photolytic (PL) and photocatalytic (PC) treatments seems promising. However, an integrated assessment scheme is needed, in which, not only the removal of the parent compound, but also the effects of the photo-transformation products (PTPs) are investigated. For this purpose, in the present study, a chronic ecotoxic assessment using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and a cytostatic and genotoxic evaluation using hepatoma cell line were performed. PL and PC treatments of OFL were applied using UV radiation. The photo-transformation of OFL during the treatments was monitored by DOC measurements and UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The chronic ecotoxicity of OFL and treated samples was evaluated using Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio fischeri; whereas the cytostasis and genotoxicity were estimated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). The main results suggest that photo-transformation of OFL took place during these treatments since the concentration of OFL decreased when the irradiation time increased, as quantified by UPLC-MS/MS analysis, and this was not coupled with an analogous DOC removal. Furthermore, nine compounds were identified as probable PTPs formed through piperazinyl dealkylation and decarboxylation. The ecotoxicity of treated solutions to the bacteria studied decreased while the cytostasis to the hepatoma cell line remained at low levels during both treatments. However, the genotoxicity to the hepatoma cell line demonstrated a different pattern in which treated samples induced a greater number of MNi for the 4-16 min of irradiation (p < 0.05) during both treatments. After 64 min of irradiation, the effects decreased to non genotoxic levels (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that UV radiation for various treatment processes (catalytic or not), such as disinfection, may create genotoxic by-products. Therefore, in relevant technical applications, the residence time during treatment should receive special attention. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Eleven antibiotics in three different categories were investigated in two types of coastal bays (a semi-enclosed bay and an open bay) of the Yellow Sea and in fresh water (rivers and sewage treatment plants [STP] effluents) that discharged into the bays. The results revealed the presence of three predominant antibiotics: dehydration erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. These antibiotics were detected in the seawater and fresh water with concentrations of <0.23-50.4 ng L-1 and <0.25-663.1 ng L-1, respectively. In terms of the regional distribution of the compounds within the two types of bays, higher concentrations (<0.23-50.4 ng L-1) and higher spatial variations (coefficients of variation: 98%-124%) were found in the semi-enclosed Jiaozhou Bay due to the poor water-exchange ability and to fresh-water inputs through rivers and/or STP effluents. In contrast, lower concentrations (<0.23-3.0 ng L-1) and lower spatial variations (coefficients of variation: 36%-75%) were present in the open Yantai Bays due to the strong water-exchange with the open sea. The source apportionment suggested that 1) fresh-water inputs were the primary source of macrolides in the coastal water, and 2) mariculture affected the relative pollution levels of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole in the bays. In addition, a risk assessment based on the calculated risk quotient (RQ) showed that the dehydrated erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and clarithromycin detected at most of the sampling sites in Jiaozhou Bay could pose high (RQ>1) risks to the most sensitive aquatic microorganisms, such as Synechococcus leopoliensis and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, whilst in the Yantai Bays, the compounds could pose medium risks (1 >= RQ > 0.1) to the same aquatic microorganisms.

AB Since the 1980s, advances in wastewater treatment technology have led to considerably improved surface water quality in the urban areas of many high income countries. However, trace concentrations of organic wastewater-associated contaminants may still pose a key environmental hazard impairing the ecological quality of surface waters. To identify key impact factors, we analyzed the effects of a wide range of anthropogenic and environmental variables on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community. We assessed ecological water quality at 26 sampling sites in four urban German lowland river systems with a 0-100% load of state-of-the-art biological activated sludge treated wastewater. The chemical analysis suite comprised 12 organic contaminants (five phosphor organic flame retardants, two musk fragrances, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, octylphenol, diethyltoluamide, terbutryn), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 12 heavy metals. Non-metric multidimensional scaling identified organic contaminants that are mainly wastewater-associated (i.e., phosphor organic flame retardants, musk fragrances, and diethyltoluamide) as a major impact variable on macroinvertebrate species composition. The structural degradation of streams was also identified as a significant factor. Multiple linear regression models revealed a significant impact of organic contaminants on invertebrate populations, in particular on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species. Spearman rank correlation analyses confirmed wastewater-associated organic contaminants as the most significant variable negatively impacting the biodiversity of sensitive macroinvertebrate species. In addition to increased aquatic pollution with organic contaminants, a greater wastewater fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in salinity. This study highlights the importance of reducing the wastewater-associated impact on surface waters. For aquatic ecosystems in urban areas this would lead to: (i) improvement of the ecological integrity, (ii) reduction of biodiversity loss, and (iii) faster achievement of objectives of legislative requirements, e.g., the European Water Framework Directive.

AB Considering the decrease water resources in the past decade, research for rational solutions on water use has become a worldwide concern. Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, and when the soil moisture level is not assured of precipitation, it is supplemented by irrigation. In the current context of climate change, and consequently the arid territories growth, the researchers are looking for solutions to rational water consumption, and equally to cover the deficit of water in agriculture. In recent years, the solution of wastewater capitalization in agriculture is often promoted, but chemical and bacteriological composition of wastewater can seriously affect both soil quality and of the products obtained (animals, humans). In this context, the paper aims at analyzing some effects on soil structure resulted from the use of two types of wastewater in irrigation, respectively primary and and tertiary effluents.

AB The aim of this study was to determine effects on methane potential and overall sludge quality from two different sludge pre-treatment technologies (ozonation high/low dosage and thermal treatment 55/70 degrees C). In general both treatments produced increased methane potential. Thermal treatment resulted in higher chemical oxygen demand (COD)-solubilisation, while the highest volatile fatty acids (VFA) increase was obtained with ozonation. Sludges had inhibiting effects in a barley seed germination assay and a yeast oestrogen screen both before and after pre-treatment, but inhibition was reduced by ozone treatment and digestion. No statistical significant reduction in concentrations of included pharmaceuticals could be observed.

AB Amoxicillin(AMX) and ampicillin (AMP), penicillin class p-lactam antibiotics, have been detected in wastewater effluents and their release into the environment may involve long-term risks such as toxicity to aquatic organisms and endocrine disruption in higher organisms. This paper demonstrates the removal of AMX and AMP by ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)) by performing kinetics and stoichiometric experiments. The dependence of the second-order rate constants of the reaction between Fe(VI) and AMX (or AMP) on pH was explained using acid-base equilibria of Fe(VI) and organic molecules. The kinetics study with the model compound, 6-aminopencillanic acid and the pH dependence behavior suggested that Fe(VI) reacted with the amine moieties of the studied beta-lactams. The reactivity of different oxidants with AMX have been shown to follow the sequence:.(OH)-O-center dot approximate to SO4 center dot- > bromine > ozone > chlorine > Fe(VI). The required molar stoichiometric ratios ([Fe(VI)]:[beta-lactam]) for the complete removal of AMX and AMP by Fe(VI) were about 4.5 and 3.5, respectively. The Fe(VI) is able to eliminate AMX and AMP and hence is likely to also oxidize other p-lactams effectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An iopromide (IOPr)-degrading bacterium was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant in Shanghai. Based on its morphology, physiological-biochemical characteristics and a phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA sequence, the bacterium was identified and named as Pseudomonas sp. I-24. The optimum condition for degrading IOPr was at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. After 5 days, strain I-24 could degrade 30 mg/L IOPr by 99% in a basal salts medium with a 5% (V/V) inoculum and 200 mg/L starch as the primary substrate. When applied to an Anaerobic-Anoxic/Aerobic (A(2)/O) process, with the coexistence of other bacteria, the strain I-24 got lower (61.3%)IOPr removal, but in two A(2)/O systems (with and without I-24 inoculation), the CODc(r) removal were both approximately 95%. The trial dosed with strain I-24 showed better IOPr removal than the un-dosed one. I-24 sustained its abundance in the A(2)/O system during the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidation of aromatic compounds of phenolic (paracetamol, -oestradiol and salicylic acid) and carboxylic (indomethacin and ibuprofen) structure used in pharmaceutics was studied. Aqueous solutions were treated with pulsed corona discharge (PCD) as a means for advanced oxidation. Pulse repetition frequency, delivered energy dose and oxidation media were the main parameters studied for their influence on the process energy efficiency. The PCD treatment appeared to be effective in oxidation of the target compounds: complete degradation of pollutant together with partial mineralization was achieved at moderate energy consumption; oxidation proceeds faster in alkaline media. Low-molecular carboxylic acids were identified as ultimate oxidation by-products formed in the reaction.

AB Occurrence and methods for the removal of nonylphenolic compounds in drinking water have been gaining increased attention due to their widespread presence in natural water and the potential health risks from the consumptions of drinking water. The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP), and bisphenol-A (BPA) in water sources and treated water in Taiwan, to evaluate the treatment efficiencies of these compounds in both the conventional (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination) and advanced treatment processes. The treatment efficiencies of these chemicals were assessed based on their concentrations in water sources, and the results were verified with laboratory simulated treatment processes. A survey of NP, OP, and BPA in 11 Taiwanese water sources showed that all of them could be identified in most of the sampled sources, and that higher concentrations of NP were found when the raw water was contaminated by domestic wastewater. However, higher treatment efficiency could be observed when the NP concentration in water source is high. Laboratory simulation studies of conventional treatment processes showed that chlorination played an important role in the degradation of NP in raw water. Treatment efficiencies of 60%-90% were achieved for NP removal when sufficient chlorine dosages were applied to satisfy chlorine demands. However, results also showed that conventional coagulation and rapid filtration processes were less effective in the reduction of phenolic compounds in water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB An intense campaign was carried out over a 14 month period to characterize concentrations and loads of 7 well-known Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), during dry and wet weather conditions, in an urban combined catchment in the northwest of Spain, a geographical zone with an average annual rainfall over 1500 mm. The main objective was to gather more in-depth knowledge of the mobilization of these "micropollutants" in an urban combined sewer and the possible pressures on water receiving bodies due to combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Hydrographs and pollutographs of these substances in dry weather flows (DWF), on weekdays and weekends, and wet weather flows (WWF) during 10 rain events have been characterized to obtain data that are sufficiently representative for statistical analysis. The research findings show that there is a considerable mobilization of these substances during rain events, mainly in the first part of the hydrographs, especially HHCB galaxolide, ibuprofen and paracetamol with maximum concentrations of 9.76, 8.51 and 5.71 mu g/L respectively, whereas these concentrations in dry weather only reached 2.57, 2.11 and 0.72 mu g/L respectively. There is a good correlation between the degree of mobilization in wet weather flows and the percentage of dry weather particulate phase of each studied substance, indicating that such mobilization may be associated with adsorption on the sediments deposited on the collectors during the antecedent dry period. These results are in good agreement with removal in conventional WWTP, especially for compounds that tend to adsorb onto sewage sludge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently occurring in sludge and waters from sewage treatment plants (STPs). Sludge obtained from sewage treatment is often applied as a fertilizer in agriculture and not many studies about the uptake of pharmaceuticals into crops can be found. In this paper, we present a greenhouse experiment to study the presence of four NSAIDs (naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and ibuprofen) in two different crops (soybean and wheat) after application of sludge as a fertilizer. Two different amounts of sludge were added to the soil; the recommended amount (with respect to phosphorus content) and the double recommended amount. One treatment without sludge was also included as a blank. The crops were harvested after 60 as well as 110 days. Only diclofenac and ibuprofen were detected in the sludge in concentrations of 22 and 217 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. None of the NSAIDs were detected in the crops from any of the treatments. Compared to the amounts applied to the soil, detection limits correspond to an uptake of less than 2% for diclofenac and 0.8% for ibuprofen. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation has been considered to be an effective means for the reduction of excess sludge in recent years. However, it remains largely unknown whether hydrophobic organic micro-pollutants, which are originally adsorbed on activated sludge, will be released into wastewater upon ozonation because of sludge solubilization. This study investigated the degradation efficiencies of several typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during sludge ozonation, including estrone (El), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), and 4-nonylphenol (NP). Results indicate that the EDCs present in activated sludge could be effectively removed by O-3 even though the apparent rate constants in sludge were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than those in water. However, the applied O-3 dose should be prudently controlled because a low dose (e.g., 29 mg O-3 g(-1) SS) may lead to an increase of BPA and NP concentrations in the liquid phase of activated sludge. Furthermore, H2O2 addition or pH adjustment could improve the removal of most studied EDCs, but exert a negative effect on the more hydrophobic and refractory compound, NP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Further polishing of effluent (pharmaceutical wastewater) from an aerobic reactor using different types of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were presented and discussed. Four types of processes were evaluated, i.e. ozonation (O-3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ultraviolet (UV) and Fenton reagent, and a combination of these AOPs (O-3/UV, H2O2/UV, O-3/H2O2 and O-3/H2O2/UV) for organic compound (as chemical oxygen demand, COD) removal have also been studied. The additional treatment of the activated sludge reactor effluent contributed substantially to overall COD removal of the pharmaceutical wastewater. Among the AOPs used in this study, O-3/H2O2/UV alternative resulted in the highest COD removal (59%) from the activated sludge effluent In specific, around 450 mg.L-1 of COD had been removed in the O-3/H2O2/UV process giving a final COD of 300 mg.L-1 in the treated effluent. Other processes (Fenton, O-3, O-3/UV, O-3/H2O2 and H2O2/UV) showed nearly constant maximum removal of 38 - 43%.

AB In order to investigate the effect of sunlight on the persistence and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals contaminating the aquatic environment, we exposed nine pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen (AA), amiodarone (AM), dapsone (DP), dexamethasone (DX), indomethacin (IM), naproxen (NP), phenytoin (PH), raloxifene (RL), and sulindac (SL)) in aqueous media to sunlight and to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254, 302 or 365 nm (UV-C, UV-B or UV-A, respectively). Degradation of the pharmaceuticals was monitored by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sunlight completely degraded AM, DP and DX within 6 hr, and partly degraded the other pharmaceuticals, except AA and PH, which were not degraded. Similar results were obtained with UV-B, while UV-A was less effective (both UV-A and -B are components of sunlight). All the pharmaceuticals were photodegraded by UV-C, which is used for sterilization in sewage treatment plants. Thus, the photodegradation rates of pharmaceuticals are dependent on both chemical structure and the wavelength of UV exposure. Toxicity assay using the luminescent bacteria test (ISO 11348) indicated that UV irradiation reduced the toxicity of some pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms by decreasing their amount (photodegradation) and increased the toxicity of others by generating toxic photoproduct(s). These results indicate the importance of investigating not only parent compounds, but also photoproducts in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments.

AB The electrochemical abatement of the drug ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid) from aqueous solution has been carried out by anodic oxidation. The electrolyses have been performed at constant current using a small, undivided cell equipped with a Pt or thin-film boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon felt cathode. The results have shown that ibuprofen has been destroyed under all the conditions tested, following pseudo-first-order kinetics; however, BDD enables higher removal rates than Pt, because the former produces greater quantity of (OH)-O-center dot. Using BDD anode, the pseudo first order rate constant increased with applied current and when NaCl replaced Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte, while it is almost unaffected by ibuprofen concentration. Mineralization of ibuprofen aqueous solutions was followed by total organic carbon (TOC) measurements.After 8 h of electrolysis, TOC removal varied from 91 % to 96 % applying a current in the range of 50-500 mA. The reaction by-products were quantified by chromatographic techniques, and in particular, aliphatic acids (oxalic, glyoxylic,formic, acetic,and pyruvic) have been the main intermediates formed during the electrolyses. The absolute rate constant for the oxidative degradation of ibuprofen have also been determined, by competition kinetic method, as 6.41 x 10 (9) M-1 s(-1).

In this paper, bisphenol A removal by using a forward osmotic membrane bioreactor and a conventional membrane bioreactor that shared one biologic reactor was studied. The total removal rate of bisphenol A by the conventional membrane bioreactor and forward osmotic membrane bioreactor was as high as 93.9% and 98%, respectively. Biodegradation plays a dominant role in the total removal of bisphenol A in both processes. In comparison of membrane rejection, the forward osmosis membrane can remove approximately 70% bisphenol A from the feed, much higher than that of the microfiltration membrane (below 10%). Forward osmosis membrane bioreactor should be operated with its BPA loading rate under 0.08 mg center dot g(-1)center dot d(-1) to guarantee the effluent bisphenol A concentration less than10 mu g center dot L-1.

DE COD reduction; Active oxidation; Fenton reagent; H2O2/Fe+2; Atenolol
AB Active pharmaceutical intermediates (API) in waste waters have adverse effects on aquatic life and environment. The API have high COD value and low BOD3 and hence difficult to treat biologically. In this study, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) utilizing the H2O2/Fe+2, Fenton reactions were investigated in lab-scale experiments for the degradation of Atenolol containing waste water streams. The experimental results showed that the Fenton process using H2O2/Fe+2 was the most effective treatment process. With Fenton processes, COD reduction of wastewater can be achieved successfully. It is suggested that Fenton processes are viable techniques for the degradation of Atenolol from the waste water stream with relatively low toxic by-products in the effluent which can be easily biodegraded in the activated sludge process. Hence, the Fenton process with H2O2/Fe+2 is considered a suitable pretreatment method to degrade the active pharmaceutical molecules and to improve the biodegradability of waste water.

To understand the possible cumulative effects of exposure to carbamazepine (CBZ), a multigenerational approach was taken in which survival, reproduction, respiration, growth, brood size, and biomass of Ceriodaphnia dubia were assessed at sublethal concentrations over the course of three successive generations. CBZ exposure significantly decreased fecundity at 196.7 mu g/L in the F0 and F1 generations over 2 weeks and acclimatized at 264.6 mu g/L in the F2 generation. Similarly, a significant decrease of neonate dry weight was observed at the 196.7 mu g/L CBZ treatment in the F1 generation, and it acclimatized at 264.6 mu g/L treatment level in the F2 generation. Median time to first brood release was significantly delayed at 264.6 mu g/L in the F2 generation, indicating slower maturation. Results over three successive generations are not different than what one would obtain by testing simply the F0 generation. Furthermore, the effects measured were observed at concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than are environmentally relevant, and it is unlikely that CBZ poses a substantial risk to the environment regarding the end points measured in this study. However, additional research through laboratory and field multigenerational studies may be required to understand the overall risk of CBZ to other nontarget organisms.

AB Contamination of surface water by antibacterial pharmaceuticals (antibacterials) from clinical settings may affect aquatic organisms, plants growth, and environmental floral bacteria. One of the methods to decrease the contamination is inactivation of antibacterials before being discharged to the sewage system. Recently, we reported the novel method based on electrolysis for detoxifying wastewater containing antineoplastics. In the present study, to clarify whether the electrolysis method is applicable to the inactivation of antibacterials, we electrolyzed solutions of 10 groups of individual antibacterials including amikacin sulfate (AMK) and a mixture (MIX) of some commercial antibacterials commonly prescribed at hospitals, and measured their antibacterial activities. AMK was inactivated in its antibacterial activities and its concentration decreased by electrolysis in a time-dependent manner. Eighty to ninety-nine percent of almost all antibacterials and MIX were inactivated within 6 h of electrolysis. Additionally, cytotoxicity was not detected in any of the electrolyzed solutions of antibacterials and MIX by the Molt-4-based cytotoxicity test. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The research focuses on the monitoring of trace metals and pharmaceuticals as potential anthropogenic indicators of industrial and urban influences on surface water. This study includes analysis of tracers use for the indication of water pollution events and discussion of the detection method of these chemicals. The following criteria were proposed for the evaluation of indicators: specificity (physical chemical properties), variability (spatial and temporal), and practicality (capacity of the sampling and analytical techniques). The combination of grab and passive water sampling (i.e., diffusive gradient in the thin film and polar organic chemical integrated samplers) procedure was applied for the determination of dissolved and labile trace metals (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diazepam, paracetamol, caffeine, diclofenac, and ketoprofen). Samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS; trace metals) and liquid chromatography-tandem MS electrospray ionization+/- (pharmaceuticals). Our results demonstrate the distinctive spatial and temporal patterns of trace elements distribution along an urban watercourse. Accordingly, two general groups of trace metals have been discriminated: "stable" (Cd and Cr) and "time varying" (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb). The relationship Cd a parts per thousand << aEuro parts per thousand Cu > Ag > Cr a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand Zn was proposed as an anthropogenic signature of the industrial and urban activities pressuring the environment from point sources (municipal wastewaters) and the group Pb-Ni was discussed as a relevant fingerprint of the economic activity (industry and transport) mainly from non-point sources (runoff, atmospheric depositions, etc.). Pharmaceuticals with contrasting hydro-chemical properties of molecules (water solubility, bioaccumulation, persistence during wastewater treatment processes) were discriminated on conservative, labile, and with combined properties in order to provide information on wastewater treatment plant efficiency, punctual events (e.g., accidents on sewage works, runoff), and uncontrolled discharges. Applying mass balance modeling, medicaments were described as relevant socio-economic indicators, which can give a picture of main social aspects of the region.

AB A screening campaign of drugs of abuse (DOA) and their relevant metabolites in the aqueous environment was performed in the Netherlands. The presence of DOA, together with the potential risks for the environment and the possible human exposure to these compounds through consumption of drinking water was investigated. Sewage water (influent and effluent), surface water of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, and drinking water (raw and finished) were analysed by four different laboratories using fully in-house validated methods for a total number of 34 DOA and metabolites. In this way, data reported for several compounds could also be confirmed by other laboratories, giving extra confidence to the results obtained in this study. In total 17 and 22 DOA were detected and quantified in influent and effluent sewage samples, respectively. The tranquilizers oxazepam and temazepam, and cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine were found in high concentrations in sewage water. Nine compounds were possibly not efficiently removed during treatment and were detected in surface waters. The results indicated that substantial fractions of the total load of DOA and metabolites in the rivers Rhine and Meuse enter the Netherlands from abroad. For some compounds, loads appear to increase going downstream, which is caused by a contribution from Dutch sewage water effluents. As far as data are available, no environmental effects are expected of the measured DOA in surface waters.
   In raw water, three DOA were detected, whereas in only one finished drinking water out of the 17 tested, benzoylecgonine was identified, albeit at a concentration below the limit of quantification (<1 ng/L). Concentrations were well below the general signal value of 1 mu g/L, which is specified for organic compounds of anthropogenic origin in the Dutch Drinking Water Act. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of the present work was to evaluate, at microcosm level, the capacity of constructed wetlands (CWs) to remove veterinary pharmaceutical compounds, from wastewater. Results indicated that CWs have potential to mitigate the release of veterinary drugs, namely enrofloxacin (ENR, a fluoroquinolone) and tetracycline (TET, tetracyclines family). Removal efficiencies of 94% and 98% where achieved for TET and ENR, respectively, when treating pigfarm wastewater effluent doped at 100 mu g L-1 drug level, along twelve weeks. Occurrence of adsorption of the drugs to CWs substrate may be the predominant mechanism for ENR, although for TET there are signs that degradation is also occurring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A model describing ibuprofen and ketoprofen biodegradation by activated sludge from three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) was developed in this study. This model successfully described the biodegradation profiles observed at two different initial concentrations of each compound, where a lag-phase was observed prior to the biodegradation of each compound. Twelve ibuprofen and ketoprofen degrading isolates were identified in this study from the WWTP sludge showing the best removal performance. One of these isolates was characterised via another model, where biodegradation was dependent on biomass growth rate as well as the ibuprofen concentration. The fact that different models were needed to describe the biodegradation by activated sludge and a pure culture suggests that the biodegradation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depends on the microbial community, thus pharmaceutical biodegradation models may require adaptation depending upon the system. This study provides an advance towards modelling pharmaceutical biodegradation in WWTPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in aquatic environment worldwide and suspected for potential ecological consequences. However, occurrences, sources and potential risks of pharmaceutical residues have rarely been investigated in Bangkok, Thailand, one of most densely populated cities in the world. We collected water samples from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), six canals, and in mainstream Chao Phraya River of Bangkok, in three sampling events representing different seasonal flow conditions, i.e., June and September 2011 and January 2012. Fourteen major pharmaceuticals including acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, roxithromycin, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfathiazole and trimethoprim were analyzed. Levels of pharmaceutical residues in WWTP influents on average were the highest for acetylsalicylic acid (4700 ng L-1), followed by caffeine (2250 ng L-1) and ibuprofen (702 ng L-1). In effluents, the concentration of caffeine was the highest (307 ng L-1), followed by acetylsalicylic acid (261 ng L-1) and mefenamic acid (251 ng L-1). In surface water, acetylsalicylic acid showed the highest levels (on average 1360 ng L-1 in canals and 313 ng L-1 in the river). Removal efficiencies of WWTPs for roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine were determined negligible. For several compounds, the concentrations in ambient water were higher than those detected in the effluents, implying contribution of the WWTPs to be negligible. Hazard quotients estimated for acetylsalicylic acid, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac and mefenamic acid in most of the canals and that of ciprofloxacin in the river, were greater than or close to 1, suggesting potential ecological risks. Ecological implications of the pharmaceutical residues in Bangkok waterway warrant further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Potential effect of ciprofloxacin HCl (GP), oxytetracycline HCl (OTC) and sulfamethazine (SM2) on the common wetland plant (Phragmites australis) was evaluated by measuring root activity, antioxidant enzymes and chlorophyll in leaf, and a study of the accumulation of antibiotics in plant was also included. Plants were incubated in six containers for 62 days and exposed to antibiotics at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L in nutrient solutions. Results illustrated that high antibiotics concentrations (>10 mu g/L) had a toxic effect on root activity and leaf chlorophyll, while hormesis occurred at low antibiotics concentrations (0.1-1 mu g/L). As antibiotics dosages increased, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity significantly declined (5-55% and 9-58%), while peroxidase activity significantly increased. P. australis accumulated antibiotics via passive absorption, exposure to 1000 mu g/L concentrations led to higher CIP, OTC, and SM2 contents in plants (13,834, 6901 and 2047 ng/g dry weight, respectively) than did exposure to 0.1 mu g/L concentrations (345, 165, and 24 ng/g dry weight, respectively). The total antibiotics content in all plants followed the sequence CIP > OTC > SM2, and the distribution of all antibiotics followed the sequence root > leaf > stem. These preliminary results indicated that P. australis could both absorb and tolerate antibiotics concentrations typically found in wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel methods utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were validated for low-level detection of 104 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ingredients (PPCPs) and four alkylphenols (APs) in environmental samples. The methods were applied to surface water, sediment, and mussel tissue samples collected from San Francisco Bay, CA, USA, an urban estuary that receives direct discharge from over forty municipal and industrial wastewater outfalls. Among the target PPCPs, 35% were detected in at least one sample, with 31, 10, and 17 compounds detected in water, sediment, and mussels, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 92 ng/L in water (valsartan), 33 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments (triclocarban), and 14 ng/g wet weight (ww) in mussels (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Nonylphenol was detected in water (<2-73 ng/L), sediments (22-86 ng/g dw), and mussels (<0.04-95 ng/g ww), and nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylates were detected in sediments (<1-40 ng/g dw) and mussels (<5-192 ng/g ww). The concentrations of PPCPs and APs detected in the San Francisco Bay samples were generally at least an order of magnitude below concentrations expected to elicit toxic effects in aquatic organisms. This study represents the first reconnaissance of PPCPs in mussels living in an urban estuary and provides the first field-derived bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for select compounds in aquatic organisms.

AB Ibuprofen is amongst the most worldwide consumed pharmaceuticals. The present work presents the first data in the occurrence of ibuprofen in Portuguese surface waters, focusing in the north area of the country, which is one of the most densely populated areas of Portugal. Analysis of ibuprofen is based on pre-concentration of the analyte with solid phase extraction and subsequent determination with liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection. A total of 42 water samples, including surface waters, landfill leachates, Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), and hospital effluents, were analyzed in order to evaluate the occurrence of ibuprofen in the north of Portugal. In general, the highest concentrations were found in the river mouths and in the estuarine zone. The maximum concentrations found were 48,720 ngL(-1) in the landfill leachate, 3,868 ngL(-1) in hospital effluent, 616 ngL(-1) in WWTP effluent, and 723 ngL(-1) in surface waters (Lima river). Environmental risk assessment was evaluated and at the measured concentrations only landfill leachates reveal potential ecotoxicological risk for aquatic organisms. Owing to a high consumption rate of ibuprofen among Portuguese population, as prescribed and non-prescribed medicine, the importance of hospitals, WWTPs, and landfills as sources of entrance of pharmaceuticals in the environment was pointed out. Landfill leachates showed the highest contribution for ibuprofen mass loading into surface waters. On the basis of our findings, more studies are needed as an attempt to assess more vulnerable areas.

AB Many pharmaceutical compounds and metabolites are found in surface and ground waters suggesting their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation/reduction processes (AO/RPs), which utilize free radical reactions to directly degrade chemical contaminants, are alternatives to traditional water treatment. This study reports the absolute rate constants for reaction of diclofenac sodium and model compound (2, 6-dichloraniline) with the two major AO/RP radicals: the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)). The bimolecular reaction rate constants (M-1 s(-1)) for diclofenac for center dot OH was (9.29 +/- 0.11) x 10(9), and for e(aq)(-) was (1.53 +/- 0.03) x 10(9). To provide a better understanding of the decomposition of the intermediate radicals produced by hydroxyl radical reactions, transient absorption spectra are observed from 1 - 250 mu s. In addition, preliminary degradation mechanisms and major products were elucidated using Co-60 gamma-irradiation and LC-MS. The toxicity of products was evaluated using luminescent bacteria. These data are required for both evaluating the potential use of AO/RPs for the destruction of these compounds and for studies of their fate and transport in surface waters where radical chemistry may be important in assessing their lifetime.

AB The removal of bisphenol AP (BPAP) by a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) was investigated. BPAP, representing typical scenarios for the BPAP-MWCNT interactions, was employed as a probe molecule. It was found that BPAP exhibited great adsorptive affinity to MWCNT, and the adsorption kinetics equilibrium was arrived within 4.0 min following the pseudo-second-order model. The overall rate process was mainly controlled by the external mass transfer. The hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, and pi-pi stacking interactions were dominant factors for the strong adsorption of BPAP, instead of the pH ionic strength and other ionic species in contaminated water. The MWCNT has higher stability within 8 removal-regeneration recycles, and up to 95% of recovery could be obtained by eluting the adsorbed BPAP on MWCNT adsorbent using ethanol/sodium hydrate solution. The results of the experiment on real samples verified the effectiveness for the recovery and removal of BPAP from wastewater samples.

Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are genes that have the ability to impart resistance to antibiotics and reduce the efficacy of antibiotics in the systems in which they are found. In the rural community of Grand Marais, Manitoba, Canada, wastewater is treated passively in a sewage lagoon prior to passage through a treatment wetland and subsequent release into surface waters. Using this facility as a model system for the Canadian Prairies, the two aims of this study were to assess: (a) the presence of nutrients, micropollutants (i.e., pesticides, pharmaceuticals), and ARGs in lagoon outputs, and (b) their potential removal by the treatment wetland prior to release to surface waters in 2012.
   Results: As expected, concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species were greatest in the lagoon and declined with movement through the wetland treatment system. Pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals were detected at concentrations in the ng/L range. Concentrations of these compounds spiked downstream of the lagoon following discharge and attenuation was observed as the effluent migrated through the wetland system. Hazard quotients calculated for micropollutants of interest indicated minimal toxicological risk to aquatic biota, and results suggest that the wetland attenuated atrazine and carbamazepine significantly. There was no significant targeted removal of ARGs in the wetland and our data suggest that the bacterial population in this system may have genes imparting antibiotic resistance.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that while the treatment wetland may effectively attenuate excess nutrients and remove some micropollutants and bacteria, it does not specifically target ARGs for removal. Additional studies would be beneficial to determine whether upgrades to extend retention time or alter plant community structure within the wetland would optimize removal of micropollutants and ARGs to fully characterize the utility of these systems on the Canadian Prairies.

AB Pharmaceuticals are common chemical contaminants in estuaries receiving effluent from wastewater and sewage treatment facilities. The purpose of this research was to examine benthic microalgal (BMA) community responses to sublethal exposures to tylosin, a common and environmentally persistent antibiotic. Bioassays, using concentrations of 0.011-218 mu mol tylosin l(-1), were performed on intertidal muddy sediments from North Inlet Estuary, SC. Exposure to tylosin resulted in a reduction in total BMA biomass and primary productivity. Furthermore, exposure seemed to retard diatom growth while having a minimal effect on cyanobacteria biomass. Estuarine systems receiving chronic inputs of trace concentrations of tylosin, as well as other antibiotics, may experience significant reductions in BMA biomass and primary productivity. Given the well-documented role of BMA in the trophodynamics of estuaries, these impacts will likely be manifested in higher trophic levels with possible impairments of the structure and function of these sensitive systems.

AB The presence and elimination of 25 emerging contaminants in two full-scale Spanish wastewater treatment plants was studied. The tertiary treatment systems consisted of coagulation, flocculation lamellar settlement and filtration (pulsed-bed sand filters) units, and disinfection was carried out by medium pressure UV light lamps and chlorination. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were found to be the emerging contaminants with the highest concentrations in secondary effluents. Photodegradable emerging contaminants (e.g. ketoprofen, triclosan and diclofenac) were removed by filtration-UV light radiation-chlorination whereas most hydrophobic compounds (e.g. galaxolide and tonalide) were eliminated by coagulation-flocculation followed by lamellar clarification, a unit in which a seasonal trend was observed. Overall mass removal efficiency was about 60%. 1-(8-Chlorocarbazolyl) acetic acid, an intermediate product of the photodegradation of diclofenac, was detected after filtration-UV-chlorination, but not after coagulation-flocculation and lamellar clarification. This study demonstrated potential for general applicability of two established tertiary treatment systems to eliminate emerging contaminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Occurrence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems is related to sewage effluents. Due to the possible adverse effects on wildlife and humans, degradation and removal of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites during wastewater treatment is an increasingly important task. The present study was part of a proof of concept study at a medium sized country hospital in western Germany that investigated efficiency of advanced treatment processes to remove toxic potencies from sewage. Specifically, the efficiency of treatment processes such as a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and ozonation to remove endocrine disruptive potentials was assessed. Estrogenic effects were characterized by use of two receptormediated in vitro transactivation assays, the Lyticase Yeast Estrogen Screen (LYES) and the Estrogen Receptor mediated Chemical Activated LUciferase gene expression (ER CALUX (R)). In addition, the H295R Steroidogenesis Assay (H295R) was utilized to detect potential disruption of steroidogenesis. Raw sewage contained measurable estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated potency as determined by use of the LYES (28.9 +/- 8.6 ng/L, 0.33x concentration), which was reduced after treatment by MBR (2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/L) and ozone (1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/L). Results were confirmed by use of ER CALUX (R) which measured concentrations of estrogen equivalents (EEQs) of 0.2 +/- 0.11 ng/L (MBR) and 0.01 +/- 0.02 ng/L (ozonation). In contrast, treatment with ozone resulted in greater production of estradiol and aromatase activity at 3x and greater concentrations in H295R cells. It is hypothesized that this is partly due to formation of active oxidized products during ozonation. Substance-specific analyses demonstrated efficient removal of most of the measured compounds by ozonation. A comparison of the ER-mediated responses measured by use of the LYES and ER CALUX (R) with those from the chemical analysis using a mass-balance approach revealed estrone (El) to be the main compound that caused the estrogenic effects. Overall, treatment of sewage by use of MBR successfully reduced estrogenicity of hospital effluents as well as substances that are able to alter sex steroid production. However, after ozonation, effluents should undergo further investigations regarding the formation of endocrine active metabolites. The results obtained as part of this study demonstrated applicability of in vitro assays for monitoring of endocrine-modulating potency of treated sewage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) with emphasis on anthelmintics and their metabolites in human sanitary waste treatment plants (HTPs), sewage treatment plants (STPs), hospital wastewater treatment plants (HWTPs), livestock wastewater treatment plants (LWTPs), river water and seawater. PPCPs showed the characteristic specific occurrence patterns according to wastewater sources. The LWTPs and HTPs showed higher levels (maximum 3000 times in influents) of anthelmintics than other wastewater treatment plants, indicating that livestock wastewater and human sanitary waste are one of principal sources of anthelmintics. Among anthelmintics, fenbendazole and its metabolites are relatively high in the LWTPs, while human anthelmintics such as albendazole and flubendazole are most dominant in the HTPs, STPs and HWTPs. The occurrence pattern of fenbendazole's metabolites in water was different from pharmacokinetics studies, showing the possibility of transformation mechanism other than the metabolism in animal bodies by some processes unknown to us. The river water and seawater are generally affected by the point sources, but the distribution patterns in some receiving water are slightly different from the effluent, indicating the influence of non-point sources.

AB Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants are not able to entirely degrade some organic pollutants that end up in the environment. Within this group of contaminants, Emerging Contaminants are mostly unregulated compounds that may be candidates for future regulation. In this work, different advanced technologies: solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation, are studied as tertiary treatments for the remediation of micropollutants present in real municipal wastewater treatment plants effluents at pilot plant scale. Contaminants elimination was followed by Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole ion trap Mass Spectrometry analysis after a pre-concentration 100:1 by automatic solid phase extraction. 66 target micropollutants were identified and quantified. 16 of those contaminants at initial concentrations over 1000 ng L-1, made up over 88% of the initial total effluent pollutant load. The order of micropollutants elimination efficiency under the experimental conditions evaluated was solar photo-Fenton > zonation > solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2. Toxicity analyses by Vibrio fischeri and respirometric tests showed no significant changes in the effluent toxicity after the three tertiary treatments application. Solar photo-Fenton and ozonation treatments were also compared from an economical point of view. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate low-cost and easy-to-operate engineering solutions that can be added as a polishing step to small wastewater treatment plants to reduce the micropollutant load to water bodies. The proposed design combines a sand filter/constructed wetland with additional and more advanced treatment technologies (UV degradation, enhanced adsorption to the solid phase, e. g., an engineered substrate) to increase the elimination of recalcitrant compounds. The removal of five micropollutants with different physico-chemical characteristics (three pharmaceuticals: diclofenac, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, one pesticide: mecoprop, and one corrosion inhibitor: benzotriazole) was studied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system. Separate batch experiments were conducted to assess the removal efficiency of UV degradation and adsorption. The efficiency of each individual process was substance-specific. No process was effective on all the compounds tested, although elimination rates over 80% using light expanded clay aggregate (an engineered material) were observed. A laboratory-scale flow-through setup was used to evaluate interactions when removal processes were combined. Four of the studied compounds were partially eliminated, with poor removal of the fifth (benzotriazole). The energy requirements for a field-scale installation were estimated to be the same order of magnitude as those of ozonation and powdered activated carbon treatments.

AB Natural and synthetic organic contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can cause ecosystem impacts, raising concerns about their persistence in receiving streams. In this study, Lagrangian sampling, in which the same approximate parcel of water is tracked as it moves downstream, was conducted at Boulder Creek, Colorado and Fourmile Creek, Iowa to determine in-stream transport and attenuation of organic contaminants discharged from two secondary WWTPs. Similar stream reaches were evaluated, and samples were collected at multiple sites during summer and spring hydrologic conditions. Travel times to the most downstream (7.4 km) site in Boulder Creek were 6.2 h during the summer and 9.3 h during the spring, and to the Fourmile Creek 8.4 km downstream site times were 18 and 8.8 h, respectively. Discharge was measured at each site, and integrated composite samples were collected and analyzed for >200 organic contaminants including metal complexing agents, nonionic surfactant degradates, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, steroidal hormones, and pesticides. The highest concentration (>100 mu g L-1) compounds detected in both WWTP effluents were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 4-nonylphenolethoxycarboxylate oligomers, both of which persisted for at least 7 km downstream from the WWTPs. Concentrations of pharmaceuticals were lower (<1 mu g L-1), and several compounds, including carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, were detected throughout the study reaches. After accounting for in-stream dilution, a complex mixture of contaminants showed little attenuation and was persistent in the receiving streams at concentrations with potential ecosystem implications.

AB The occurrence and multi-phase distribution of five pharmaceutical compounds were investigated in an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) receiving river by analysis of pharmaceuticals in sediment, particulate matter, conventional dissolved phase (>0.7 mu m), colloidal phase (5 kDa to 0.7 mu m), and truly dissolved phase (<5 kDa) water. Diclofenac was found in all samples, followed by clofibric acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen with the decreasing detection frequency. All targets in WWTP outfall site were higher than those in the upstream and downstream, indicating that the WWTP is an important input source of pharmaceuticals in the river. The colloidal phase contributed 10-14% of ketoprofen, 8-26% of naproxen, 17-36% of clofibric acid, 22-33% of diclofenac, and 9-28% of ibuprofen in the aquatic system, suggesting the colloids will play an important role as carrier to contaminants in the aquatic environment. Based on truly dissolved concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water, only the risk quotient (RQ) value for diclofenac towards fish was higher than 1, indicating it poses a potential risk to aquatic organisms. Finally, a Level III fugacity model was used to further assess the environmental fate of the selected pharmaceuticals (exemplified for clofibric acid and diclofenac). Both clofibric acid and diclofenac tend to accumulate in water compartment with the percentage of 99.7% and 60.6%, respectively. Advection in river is a significant loss process for clofibric acid (56.4%) and diclofenac (54.4%). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative study of ultrasonication (US), Fenton's oxidation (FO) and ferro-sonication (FS) (combination of ultrasonication and Fenton's oxidation) advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater (WW) is reported for the first time. CBZ is a worldwide used antiepileptic drug, found as a persistent emerging contaminant in many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents and other aquatic environments. The oxidation treatments of WW caused an effective removal of the drug. Among the various US, FO and FS pre-treatments carried out, higher soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and soluble organic carbon (SOC) increment (63 to 86% and 21 to 34%, respectively) was observed during FO pre-treatment process, resulting in higher removal of CBZ (84 to 100%) from WW. Furthermore, analysis of by-products formed during US, FO and FS pre-treatment in WW was carried out by using laser diode thermal desorption-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LDTD-APCI) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LDTD-APCI-MS/MS analysis indicated formation of two by-products, such as epoxycarbamazepine and hydroxycarbamazepine due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH-) with CBZ during the three types of pre-treatment processes. In addition, the estrogenic activity of US, FO and FS pre-treated sample with CBZ and its by-products was carried out by Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) assay method. Based upon the YES test results, none of the pre-treated samples showed estrogenic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, statistical design was applied for the optimization of process parameters for the biofiltration of toluene using mixed microorganisms obtained from pharmaceuticals wastewater sludge in a packed bed biofilter. The effects of process parameters such as gas flow rate, initial toluene concentration, height of the packing material, and temperature on removal efficiency (RE) of toluene was studied and optimized using response surface methodology. Using Box-Behnken Design, 30 experiments were carried out for the four test variables. From the results, the optimum condition for maximum RE was found to be: gas flow rate-0.01 m(3)h(-1), initial toluene concentration -0.25 gm(-3), packing height-0.75 m, and temperature -31 degrees C. At these optimized conditions, the removal efficiency of toluene was found to be 95 %. A high R-2 value of greater than 0.9 indicates the fitness of the model to predict the experimental data. Biokinetic studies led to a good fit between experimental data and mathematical equations, yielding a calculated maximum toluene degradation rate of 140.42 gm(-3)h(-1) with a half-velocity constant, K-S, of 0.076 gm(-3).

AB Second-order rate reaction constants of micropollutants with chlorine are essential for evaluating their removal efficiencies from water during chlorine disinfection. In this study, the reactions of five selected emerging contaminants with unavailable kinetic data (Benzotriazole, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or DEET, Chlorophene, 3-Methylindole, and Nortriptyline HCl) with chlorine and bromine have been investigated, and their apparent second-order rate constants have been determined as a function of the pH. For the chlorination process, the intrinsic rate constants for the elementary reactions of the ionized and neutral species were also evaluated. The sequence of reaction rates was Methylindole > Chlorophene > Nortriptyline HCl > Benzotriazole > DEET. The bromination of the selected emerging contaminants in ultra-pure water provided exactly the same sequence of reaction rates as in the chlorination process, although higher values of rate constants. The efficiency of the chlorination process for the degradation of these ECs when present in several aqueous systems (surface water from a public reservoir, and two effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants) was investigated. During wastewater or drinking water treatment, chlorine is a good option for the degradation of Methylindole, and in a lower extent for Chlorophene and Nortriptyline. However, it is not a suitable oxidant for the abatement of Benzotriazole and DEET. Finally, chlorination in the presence of bromide revealed that low bromide concentrations enhanced slightly the degradation of the selected compounds during chlorine oxidation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The elimination of diphenolic acid (DPA) from contaminated water is an urgent challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate DPA degradation by gamma radiation, studying the influence of the dose rate, initial DPA concentration, solution pH, the presence of O-2, and the presence of different additives (e.g., Br-, Cl-, CO32-, NO2-, NO3-, and SON. A further objective was to study the effect of the water matrix (ultrapure water, surface water, and wastewater) and the variation in total organic carbon and toxicity as a function of absorbed dose. Results obtained showed that: gamma radiation was effective to remove DPA from aqueous solution; the dose constant was slightly dependent on the dose rate; and the solution pH had a major influence on DPA degradation, which was highest at pH 7. DPA degradation was reduced in the presence of Br-, Cl-, CO32-, NO2-, NO3-, and SO42- and was lower with higher concentrations of these species, largely due to their competition with DPA for the reactive radicals generated, especially Ha. Lower yield of DPA decomposition were obtained with wastewater and surface water than with ultrapure water due to the presence of organic matter and HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3- ions, which react with the reactive radical species (HO., H-. and e(aq)(-)). The TOC and toxicity of the medium decreased during DPA degradation in all water types studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concern over prospective levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in waters has increased in recent years due to its disinfection byproduct formation potential from chloramination. It has been mooted that this is promoted by organic precursors from municipal wastewaters, such that there is a more significant risk of excessive levels in water reuse applications.
   Experiments conducted on chloramination and chlorination of secondary wastewater have confirmed that that significant NDMA formation arises only from chloramination, with its concentration varying with test conditions used. A full factor analysis revealed all parameters studied (temperature, pH, monochloramine dose and contact time), both individually and synergistically, to have a statistically significant impact on NDMA formation with contact time being the most important. At raw water temperatures below 10 degrees C, the NDMA concentration can be minimised to below the 10 ng L-1 threshold by not exceeding a monochloramine dose of 2 mg L-1 as Cl-2. However, at higher water temperatures other measures are required to suppress NDMA formation, such as reducing the contact time (which could prove impractical in most applications) or maintaining a pH below 6. Further trials are required to fully develop the operating envelope to ensure NDMA concentrations do not exceed the 10 ng L-1 threshold, or else to identify effective pretreatment methods for removing the NDMA precursors.

AB Numerous studies have shown the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in different environmental compartments, for example, in surface water or wastewater ranging from nanograms per litre to micrograms per litre. Likewise, some recent studies have pointed to seasonal variability, thus indicating that PhAcs concentrations in the aquatic environment may depend on the time of year. This work intended to find out (1) whether Tagus fluvial and drinking water were polluted with different groups of PhACs and (2) if their concentrations differed between winter and summer seasons. From the 58 substances analysed, 41 were found belonging to the main therapeutic groups. Statistical differences were seen for antibacterials, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiepileptics, and cardiovascular drugs, with higher concentrations being detected in winter than in summer. These results might indicate that the PhACs analysed in this study undergo lower environmental degradation in winter than in summer. In order to confirm these initial results, a continuous monitoring should be performed especially on those PhACs that either because of an elevated consumption or an intrinsic chemical persistence are poorly degraded during winter months due to low temperatures and solar irradiation. It is especially important to identify which of these specific PhACs are in order to recommend their substitution by equally effective and safe substances but also environmentally friendly.

AB The removal of estrogenic chemicals during wastewater reclamation has been a great concern. Current advanced treatment processes are inefficient for the removal of estrogenic chemicals from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to the coexistence of other pollutants with less environmental significance which are also removed simultaneously. The search for highly selective and low-cost removal methods is warranted. Therefore, surface-molecular-imprinted polymer-modified TiO2 nanotube (S-MIP-TiO2 NT) photocatalysts were fabricated, characterized, and tested for the removal of estrogenic pollutants from wastewater in this study for the first time. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that the TiO2 NTs (with an average diameter of 60 nm) were successfully imprinted with functional groups (i.e., carboxyl). The adsorption selectivity and photocatalytic activity of the S-MIP-TiO2 NTs towards template compound (17 beta-estradiol, E2) were improved, compared with neat TiO2 NTs. Interestingly, S-MIP-TiO2 NTs exhibited higher adsorption intensity and photocatalytic selectivity at low concentrations (from 10 ng/L to 100 mu g/L, as normal estrogenic chemical concentrations in secondary effluents) of E2 than that at high concentrations (from 10 to 1,000 mg/L). It was also found that some representative estrogenic chemicals and estrogenic activity could be selectively and rapidly removed from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants using S-MIP-TiO2 NTs as photocatalysts. In addition, S-MIP-TiO2 NT photocatalysts exhibited excellent regeneration characteristics. Photocatalytic treatment using S-MIP-TiO2 NTs could be a promising approach for the effective removal of estrogenic chemicals from secondary effluents of municipal WWTPs.

AB A water solution of emerging contaminants (ECs) was treated by advanced oxidation systems. Ozone-based processes led to the highest ECs degradation rates. Regardless of the nature of the aqueous matrix, no differences in EC removal were obtained when O3 was added. Mineralization occurred to some extent when activated carbon (AC) or O3 were present. O3, UVA/TiO2/O2, and UVA/TiO2/O3 processes were applied in runs carried out with low ECs concentration. Single ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation led to the complete ECs degradation in less than 5min. When a secondary effluent was used, the efficiency of the technologies decreased. With the exception of caffeine, a detrimental effect of other organic/inorganic compounds present in secondary effluents was observed.

AB Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are widely used tricyclic antidepressant drugs. They have been detected in wastewater, surface runoff, and effluents from sewage treatment plants. As such, they could potentially reach agriculture land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water. In the absence of data on their fate in the environment, the persistence and dissipation pathways of radiolabeled amitriptyline were determined in three agriculture soils varying widely in texture and chemical properties (loam soil, clay loam soil, and sandy loam soil). Tritiated amitriptyline was added to laboratory microcosms containing soils, and the metabolism of the extractable 3H was monitored during incubation at 30 degrees C. The total solvent extractable radioactivity decreased in all three soils with times to dissipate 50% of material (DT50) ranging from 34.1 +/- 3.2 (loam soil) to 85.3 +/- 3.2 d (sandy soil). Nortriptyline (N-desmethyl amitriptyline) and amitriptyline-N-oxide were identified as major transformation products in all three soils by high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS/UV). The addition of liquid municipal biosolids to the loam soil had no effect on the dissipation of amitriptyline. The persistence of nortriptyline was evaluated in the loam soil. The DT50 of nortriptyline was 40.5 +/- 3.2 d estimated with HPLC-TOF-MS/UV. Approximately 10% of added nortriptyline was converted to hydroxylated products after 50 d of incubation. In summary, amitriptyline persisted in agricultural soils with major dissipation mechanisms, including forming nonextractable residues and producing various transformation products including the psychoactive drug nortriptyline.

AB The Patancheru area near Hyderabad in India is recognized as a key link in the global supply chain for many bulk drugs. A central treatment plant receives wastewater from approximately 90 different manufacturers, and the resulting complex effluent has contaminated surface, ground, and drinking water in the region. Ecotoxicological testing of the effluent has shown adverse effects for several organisms, including aquatic vertebrates, at high dilutions. In addition, a recent study of microbial communities in river sediment indicated that the contamination of antibiotic substances might contribute to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes. In an attempt to start investigating how exposure to effluent-contaminated water may directly affect humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, rats were tube-fed effluent. Several pharmaceuticals present in the effluent could be detected in rat blood serum at low concentrations. However, results from exploratory microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays indicated no marked effects on hepatic gene transcription after 5 d of exposure. Clinical analysis of blood serum constituents, used as biomarkers for human disease did not reveal any significant changes, nor was there an effect on weight gain. The authors could not find evidence for any acute toxicity in the rat; however, the authors cannot rule out that was there an effect on weight gain higher doses of effluent or a longer exposure time may still be associated with risks for terrestrial vertebrates.

AB Regeneration of wastewater treatment plant effluents constitutes a solution to increase the availability of water resources in arid regions. Water reuse legislation imposes an exhaustive control of the microbiological quality of water in the operation of disinfection tertiary treatments. Additionally, recent reports have paid increasing attention to emerging micropollutants with potential biological effects even at trace level concentration. This work focuses on the evaluation of several photochemical technologies as disinfection processes with the aim of simultaneously achieving bacterial inactivation and oxidation of pharmaceuticals as examples of emerging micropollutants typically present in water and widely studied in the literature. UV-C-based processes show a high efficiency to inactivate bacteria. However, the bacterial damages are reversible and only when using H2O2, bacterial reproduction is affected. Moreover, a complete elimination of pharmaceutical compounds was not achieved at the end of the inactivation process. In contrast, UV-A/TiO2 required a longer irradiation time to inactivate bacteria but pharmaceuticals were completely removed along the process. In addition, its oxidation mechanism, based on hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), leads to irreversible bacterial damages, not requiring of chemicals to avoid bacterial regrowth. For UV-A/TiO2/H2O2 process, the addition of H2O2 improved Escherichia coli inactivation since the cell wall weakening, due to (OH)-O-center dot attacks, allowed H2O2 to diffuse into the bacteria. However, a total elimination of the pharmaceuticals was not achieved during the inactivation process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method coupled with an automated solid-phase extraction procedure has been developed to identify 22 psychiatric pharmaceuticals, including seven anxiolytic-sedative-hypnotics, six antidepressants, and nine anti-schizophrenia drugs, in wastewater samples from two psychiatric hospital wastewater treatment plants (P-WWTPs) and three municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs) in Beijing, China. Analyte recoveries from splicing experiments in the WWTP influent and effluent at three concentrations ranged from 70% to 110%, excluding sulpiride, ziprasidone, and olanzapine. Method detection limits for five, eight, and nine analytes in the WWTP influent and effluent were 20-80, 1-16, and <1 ng L-1, respectively. High psychiatric pharmaceutical concentrations (e.g., similar to 942 ng L-1 oxazepam, 5552-12,782 ng L-1 clozapine, 2762-9832 ng L(-1)sulpiride, and 2030-4967 ng L-lquetiapine) were frequently observed in P-WWTP influent compared to M-WWTPs. Although P-WWTPs typically had higher removal rates, significantly higher concentrations of the target compounds were observed in the P-WWTP secondary effluent than in the M-WWTP influent (e.g., 752 ng L-1 oxazepam, 8183 ng L-1 clozapine, 10,833 ng L-1 sulpiride, and 1168 ng L-1 quetiapine). Thus, the discharge control of psychiatric pharmaceuticals from psychiatric hospitals requires improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) is a new tool for the sampling of organic pollutants in water. We tested this device for the monitoring of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater. After calibration, a field application was carried out in a French hospital for six pharmaceutical compounds (Atenolol, Prednisolone, Methylprednisolone, Sulfamethoxazole, Ofloxacin, Ketoprofen).
   POCIS were calibrated in tap water and wastewater in laboratory conditions close to relevant environmental conditions (temperature, flow velocity). Sampling rates (R-s) were determined and we observed a significant increase with flow velocity and temperature. Whatever the compound, the Rs value was lower in wastewater and the linear phase of uptake was shorter.
   POCIS were deployed in a hospital sewage pipe during four days and the estimated water concentrations were close to those obtained with twenty-four hour composite samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are released into aquatic ecosystems through discharged sewage wastewater. Antidepressants are among those APIs often detected in wastewater effluent and have been recently reported to cause foot detachment from the substrate in freshwater snails. We tested the effects of four commonly prescribed antidepressants (fluoxetine ("Prozac"), fluvoxamine ("Luvox"), venlafaxine ("Effexor"), and citalopram ("Celexa") on adhesion to the substrate in five species of marine snails, three from the Pacific coast (Chlorostoma funebralis, Nucella ostrina, Urosalpinx cinerea) and two species from the Atlantic coast (Tegula fasciatus and Lithopoma americanum) of North America representing three different gastropod families. All antidepressants tested induced foot detachment from the substrate in all snail species in a mainly dose-dependent manner (p < 0.04-0.00000001). The lowest LOECs (lowest observed effect concentration) for antidepressants and snails were recorded for Lithopoma in 43.4 mu g/L (100 nM) fluvoxamine and Chlorostoma in 157 mu g/L (500 nM) venlafaxine and 217 mu g/L (500 nM) fluvoxamine. The trochids and turbinids were 2-10x more sensitive to the antidepressants than the muricids. Latency to detachment was also dose dependent, with the fastest average times to detach seen in Chlorostoma and Lithopoma (7.33 and 13.16 min respectively in 3.13 mg/L venlafaxine). The possible physiological mechanisms regulating antidepressant-induced foot detachment in marine snails and the possible ecological consequences are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In highly urbanized areas, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent can represent a significant component of freshwater ecosystems. As it is impossible for the composition of WWTP effluent to match the composition of the receiving system, the potential exists for effluent to significantly impact the chemical and biological characteristics of the receiving ecosystem. We assessed the impacts of WWTP effluent on the size, activity, and composition of benthic microbial communities by comparing two distinct field sites in the Chicago metropolitan region: a highly urbanized river receiving effluent from a large WWTP and a suburban river receiving effluent from a much smaller WWTP. At sites upstream of effluent input, the urban and suburban rivers differed significantly in chemical characteristics and in the composition of their sediment bacterial communities. Although effluent resulted in significant increases in inorganic nutrients in both rivers, surprisingly, it also resulted in significant decreases in the population size and diversity of sediment bacterial communities. Tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed significant effects of effluent on sediment bacterial community composition in both rivers, including decreases in abundances of Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfococcus, Dechloromonas, and Chloroflexi sequences and increases in abundances of Nitro-spirae and Sphingobacteriales sequences. The overall effect of the WWTP inputs was that the two rivers, which were distinct in chemical and biological properties upstream of the WWTPs, were almost indistinguishable downstream. These results suggest that WWTP effluent has the potential to reduce the natural variability that exists among river ecosystems and indicate that WWTP effluent may contribute to biotic homogenization.

AB The accurate quantification of enantiomers is crucial for assessing the biodegradation of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment. Methods to quantify enantiomers in environmental matrices are scarce. Here, we used an enantioselective method, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD), to analyze two beta-blockers, metoprolol and atenolol, and the antidepressant fluoxetine in an activated sludge consortium from a wastewater treatment plant. The vancomycin-based chiral stationary phase was used under polar ionic mode to achieve the enantioseparation of target chiral pharmaceuticals in a single chromatographic run. The method was successfully validated over a concentration range of 20-800 ng/mL for each enantiomer of both beta-blockers and of 50-800 ng/mL for fluoxetine enantiomers. The limits of detection were between 5 and 20 ng/mL and the limits of quantification were between 20 and 50 ng/mL, for all enantiomers. The intra- and inter-batch precision was lower than 5.66 and 8.37 %, respectively. Accuracy values were between 103.03 and 117.92 %, and recovery rates were in the range of 88.48-116.62 %. Furthermore, the enantioselective biodegradation of atenolol, metoprolol and fluoxetine was followed during 15 days. The (S)-enantiomeric form of metoprolol was degraded at higher extents, whereas the degradation of atenolol and fluoxetine did not show enantioselectivity under the applied conditions.

AB The present paper presents the occurrence of 72 pharmaceuticals and 23 transformation products (TPs) in groundwaters (GWs) underlying the city of Barcelona, Spain. Thirty-one samples were collected under different districts, and at different depths. Aquifers with different geologic features and source of recharge were included, i.e., natural bank filtration, infiltration from wastewater and water supply pipes, rainfall recharge, etc. Antibiotics were the most frequently found compounds detected at levels reaching 1000 ng L-1. Natural bank filtration from the river that receives large amounts of effluents from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), turned out being the most influencing source of contamination, thus GW showed high range of compounds and concentrations as high as or even higher than in the river itself. In general, TPs were found at lower concentrations than the corresponding parent compounds, with some exceptions, such as 4OH propranolol and enalaprilat. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The applicability of a polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) for detection and determination of perfluorinated acids and sulfonates in water was studied under field conditions. Standard POCIS configurations (i.e., pharmaceutical and pesticide) were deployed in effluent from a wastewater treatment plant for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Ten of 15 target compounds were found in POCIS, five of which were quantified in wastewater. Pest-POCIS appeared more effective for the sampling, while Pharm-POCIS had a more rapid uptake kinetic, which leads to faster saturation or equilibrium. The results showed that the pesticide configuration is probably more suitable for the sampling of this class of compounds. Based on average concentration in water over the sampling period and amount of compound adsorbed in the POCIS, we calculated sampling rates for five studied compounds and obtained values of 0.034 to 0.222 L day(-1).

The combination of the TiO2/Ni electrode and MWCNTs air cathode was adopted to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater by the process of photoelectrocatalysis. Various operational parameters to achieve optimum efficiency of this photoelectrocatalytic degradation system are presented, such as applied bias voltage, NaCl concentration, pH and different degradation methods. Under the optimal conditions, the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour are 93.5% and 78.5% respectively. The possible roles of the anodecathode on the reactions and the probable mechanisms of effect were also discussed.

AB The presence and distribution of typical of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), which comprise two types of polycyclic musks (PCMs) including Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN) as well as six types of estrogens containing estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and bisphenol A (BPA), were investigated at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Jiangsu, China. Only raw wastewater was treated in WWTP A while WWTP B was serving an urban-industrialized area. In the influent, the concentrations of EE2 (2193-4437 ng L-1), E2 (1126-1170 ng L-1), and DES (268-421 ng L-1) were generally higher than the previously reported values, whereas the concentrations of HHCB (306-316 ng L-1), E1 (29-129 ng L-1), E3 (53 ng L-1), and BPA (26-176 ng L-1) were much lower than those reported in other previous studies. In addition, AHTN was not detected in either WWTP and E3 was not found in WWTP B. The detected processes including anaerobic/oxic process (A/O), combined orbal oxidation ditch process (C-orbal OD) and anaerobic/anoxic/anoxic/oxic membrane biological reactor (A/A/A/O-MBR) showed higher removal efficiencies for HHCB (67-71%) and EE2 (87%) than those in other previous studies. Besides, the total hydraulic retention time (HRT) ranged between 6.7 and 20.0 h, sludge retention time (SRT) ranged between 8 and 23 d, and water temperature ranged from 24.8 to 28.2 degrees C. The removal efficiencies for estrogens in biological processes were related to the following factors: the level of hydrophobic estrogens, the type of removal process (C-orbal OD was consistently less efficient in removing estrogens than A/O and A/A/A/O-MBR), and a high SRT or HRT (A/A/A/O-MBR with higher SRT and HRT showed higher and more stable removal of hydrophobic estrogens).

AB Colistin is a peptide antibiotic widely used as a food additive in animal farming, specially swine and poultry, and also has recently been applied in human medicine to treat infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria strains. When orally administered, colistin is eliminated in feces virtually unaltered; thus, it may reach water bodies and wastewater treatment facilities in its active form. Apart from the risks associated with development of antimicrobial resistance and environmental toxicity issues, the presence of antimicrobials in wastewater can, additionally, interfere in biological processes commonly used to treat them. Nitrifying bacteria are among the most sensitive microorganisms to inhibitory compounds, including pharmaceuticals, and are useful as biosensors to access contaminant toxicity information in wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, in order to assess the colistin acute toxicity to the microorganisms involved in the nitrification processes, the nitritation and nitratation kinetics were monitored under different colistin concentrations. The results showed that only ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic, presenting an IC50 of 10.8 mg L-1 of colistin when used as a commercial formulation and 67.0 mg L-1 when used as raw colistin sulfate. For nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, even the highest colistin concentration used in the assays (316 mg L-1) was not sufficient to inhibit the process. According to these results, the colistin concentrations expected in animal farming wastewater, when its dosage is used as a growth promoter, would not be enough to keep nitrification from taking place. Nevertheless, when used in higher concentrations, such as for therapeutic purposes, it could endanger the maintenance of the process.

AB Simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent were successfully achieved using TiO2 microspheres modified with both platinum nanoparticles and phosphates (P-TiO2/Pt) for the first time. The coexistence of platinum and phosphate on the surface of TiO2 microspheres was confirmed by transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. P-TiO2/Pt microspheres showed a significantly higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2 microspheres and TiO2 powders (P25) for the removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluent with the removal ratio of 100%, 58.2% and 48.5% in 200 min, respectively. Moreover, the marked production of hydrogen (photonic efficiency: 3.23 x 10(-3)) was accompanied by the removal of estrogenic activity only with P-TiO2/Pt as photocatalysts. The hydrogen production rate was increasing with decreased DO concentration in secondary effluent. Results of reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluation during P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process showed that O-2(-) and OH were dominant ROS in aerobic phase, while OH was the most abundant ROS in anoxic phase. Changes of effluent organic matter (EfOM) during photocatalysis revealed that aromatic, hydrophobic, and high molecular weight fractions of EfOM were preferentially transformed into non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW fractions (e.g. aldehydes and carboxylic acids), which were continuously utilized as electron donors in hydrogen production process.

AB This study provides the first investigation on the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in the tropical aquatic environment of Malaysia. Water samples were collected at seven different sites along the Langat River and effluents from five sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Langat River Basin. Samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 18 pharmaceuticals from six therapeutic classes and one metabolite. Fifteen out of these 19 pharmaceuticals were detected in the river water samples. Mefenamic acid, salicylic acid and glibenclamide were detected in all river water samples indicating their ubiquitous nature and resistance to degradation under the warm and humid tropical conditions. The median concentrations of detected pharmaceuticals ranged from less than the method detection limit (<MDL) for furosemide, loratadine, salbutamol, perindopril, metoprolol and nifedipine to 112.7?ng?L-1 for diclofenac. A similar number of pharmaceuticals were detected in the STPs effluents samples. Several of these pharmaceuticals, namely salbutamol, atenolol, metoprolol, mefenamic acid, salicylic acid and furosemide were detected in all the STPs effluents samples. The median concentrations for the detected pollutants ranged between <MDL for lovastatin and amlodipine to 1994?ng?L-1 for metformin. The highest concentration detected in the river water samples was for acetaminophen (346.3?ng?L-1) and in STPs effluents was for metformin (34228?ng?L-1). The concentrations of most analytes found in this study were comparable to those reported in the other parts of the world. However, this is the first time amlodipine is detected in the environmental samples.

AB Synthetic progestins are widely used as a component in both contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), both on their own and in combination with EE2. Their presence in the environment is now established in wastewater effluent and river water and this has led to concerns regarding their potential effects on aquatic organisms living in these waters. We carried out in vivo experiments to determine the potencies of four different synthetic progestins on the reproductive capabilities of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). We then performed a series of in vitro assays to try and determine the reason for the effects seen in the in vivo experiments. In the first experiment, fathead minnow exposed to a single concentration of 100 ng/L of either Levonorgestrel or Gestodene stopped spawning almost completely. The same nominal concentration of Desogestrel and Drospirenone did not affect reproduction (21 d NOECs of 100 ng/L). The second experiment investigated two progestins of different potency: Gestodene at 1, 10, and 100 ng/L and Desogestrel at 100 ng/L, 1 mu g/L, and 10 mu g/L. Gestodene concentrations as low as 1 ng/L had significant effects on reproduction over 21 d, whereas concentrations of Desogestrel at or above 1 mu g/L were required to significantly reduce egg production. The synthetic progestins also masculinized the female fish in a concentration-dependent manner. Results from yeast-based in vitro assays demonstrated that the progestins are all strongly androgenic, thereby explaining the masculinization effects. The results strongly suggest that synthetic progestins merit serious consideration as environmental pollutants.

AB In this study, the removal and recovery of bisphenol F (BPF) by multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were investigated. MWCNT has shown the great potential as a kind of effective adsorbents for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)-BPF in wastewater treatment. The results indicated that the removal percentages of BPF could reach up to 96.2% within 4 min under pH 4-10. BPF adsorption kinetics was found to be very fast and the equilibrium was attained within 4.0 min following the pseudo-second-order model with observed rate constants (k) 0.707-3.175 g mg(-1) min(-1) (at varied temperatures). The adsorption mechanisms were the non-electrostatic dispersion interaction, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction between BPF and MWCNT and the overall rate process mainly governed by the external mass transfer. Most of the co-existing ions which were studied have negligible effect on the sorption BPF by MWCNT. Furthermore, MWCNT was of high stability in eight times removal-regeneration recycles. In summary, MWCNT is an excellent adsorbent which can be used for BPF removal in contaminated water treatment process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has documented the ubiquity of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in freshwater, though their persistence and transport is relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the abundance and transport of human and veterinary PPCPs in a rural, central Indiana stream influenced by confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Research objectives also aimed to identify mechanisms controlling abundance and transport PPCP concentrations and stream physicochemical characteristics were measured monthly over one year at multiple sites along a 60 km reach. Overall, human PPCPs were more abundant and measured at higher concentrations than veterinary pharmaceuticals. Veterinary pharmaceutical concentrations (lincomycin, sulfamethazine) were greatest in stream reaches adjacent to CAFOs. No distinct spatial variation was observed for human PPCPs. However, caffeine and paraxanthine had significant temporal variation with higher concentrations in winter. In contrast, DEET had higher concentrations in summer. Pharmaceutical load (mu g/s) ranged from<0.005 to 1808 mu g/s across sites, sampling events and pharmaceutical compounds with human PPCPs having higher loads relative to veterinary pharmaceuticals. Reach input ranged from net retention (sulfamethazine in August) to 1667 mu g/m/d paraxanthine in March. Triclosan had the highest measured mean input into the reach (661 mu g/m/d) and sulfamethazine had the lowest mean input (32 mu g/m/d). Across measured compounds, input of PPCPs into the reach was two orders of magnitude lower than nitrate-N input (57,000 mu g/m/d). Transport metrics indicated acetaminophen and caffeine are transported farther than triclosan though had lower loss velocities (loss relative to abundance). Loss rate of PPCPs was an order of magnitude lower than nitrate-N loss rate. Human PPCPs were more abundant than veterinary pharmaceuticals in this rural watershed influenced by CAFOs. Further, concentrations had significant temporal and spatial variation highlighting differential sources and fates. Thus, mechanisms driving PPCP retention and transport need to be identified to aid management of these emerging contaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Berberine is a broad-spectrum antibiotic extensively used in personal medication. The production of berberine results in the generation of wastewater containing concentrated residual berberine. However, few related studies up to date focus on berberine removal from wastewaters. In this study, a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)-membrane bioreactor (MBR) process was developed for berberine removal from synthetic wastewater. The performance of the UASB-MBR system on berberine, COD and NH4+-N removal was investigated at different berberine loadings. And the effects of berberine on bacterial communities were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Results showed that, as the increase of berberine loadings, VASE performance was affected remarkably, whereas, efficient and stable performance of MBR ensured the overall removal rates of berberine, COD and NH4+-N consistently reached up to 99%, 98% and 98%, respectively. Significant shifts of bacterial community structures were detected in both UASB and MBR, especially in the initial operations. Along with the increase of berberine loadings, high antibiotic resisting species and some functional species, i.e. Acinetobacter sp., Clostridium sp., Propionibacterium sp., and Sphingomonas sp. in UASB, as well as Sphingomonas sp., Methylocystis sp., Hydrogenophaga sp. and Flavobacterium sp. in MBR were enriched in succession.

AB In order to evaluate the effect of anaerobic digestion intermediates and antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewaters on anaerobic digestion process, their acute toxicities were tested using the 15 mm median inhibitory concentration (IC50) at pH 7.00 +/- 0.05. The results showed that the IC50 of ethanol, acetate, propionate and butyrate were 19.40, 20.71, 10.47 and 12.17 g L-1 respectively, which suggested the toxicity descended in the order of propionate, butyrate, ethanol and acetate. The IC50 of aureomycin, polymyxin and chloromycetin were 12.06, 6.24 and 429.90 mg L-1 respectively, which indicated the toxicity descended in the order of polymyxin, aureomycin and chloromycetin. Using equitoxic ratio mixing method, the joint toxicities of five groups referred by A (four anaerobic digestion intermediates), B (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and aureomycin), C (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and polymyxin), D (four anaerobic digestion intermediates and chloromycetin) and E (four anaerobic digestion intermediates, aureomycin, polymyxin and chloromycetin) were investigated respectively. Their interactions were additive (A), synergistic (B), additive (C), synergistic (D) and synergistic (E). The investigation would lay a basis for the optimization of anaerobic biotechnology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A variety of pharmaceuticals enter waterways by way of treated wastewater effluents and remain biochemically active in aquatic systems. Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. As such, our results show that anxiolytic drugs in surface waters alter animal behaviors that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences.

AB Rural communities in the United States usually use a series of aerated lagoons to treat domestic wastewater. Effluents from these systems are typically discharged to receiving watersheds, which leads to a potential transfer of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and steroid hormones from sanitary sewage to the environment. The primary objectives of this study are to identify and quantify PPCPs and steroid hormones in rural sewage treatment lagoons, to investigate the removal efficiency of these emerging contaminants in the treatment processes, and to monitor their occurrence in the surrounding watershed. In this study, a method has been developed to analyze thirteen PPCPs and eight steroid hormones in various water samples. Among all of the PPCPs considered, ten chemicals were detected in sewage influents, lagoon waters of different treatment stages, or effluents at concentrations in the ng/L to low mu g/L range. Three hormones were observed in the influents at total concentrations as high as 164 ng/L, but no hormone residues were detected in the effluents. This indicates that the aerated lagoons may effectively remove hormone conthminants. With the exception of carbamazepine, removal rates for the other detected PPCPs were relatively high in the range of 88 to 100% in September with average air temperature equal to 20 degrees C. However, the removal efficiency of nine PPCPs in the rural wastewater treatment plant exhibited large temporal variability. The concentrations of PPCPs in the lagoon waters and effluents collected in November, with average air temperature equal to 4.4 degrees C, were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those samples collected in September. Occurrence of these PPCP contaminants in the surrounding watershed was also monitored. The discharge of effluents significantly elevated the PPCP concentrations in the receiving creek and increased their occurrence in the adjacent river. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nutrient enrichment and loadings of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals into freshwater systems are common concerns, especially for water bodies receiving wastewater inputs. In the rural communities of Morden and Winkler of Manitoba, Canada, sewage lagoons discharge their wastewater directly into Dead Horse Creek, a small tributary of the Red River that empties into Lake Winnipeg. This lagoon approach to managing rural wastewaters is common across the North American Prairies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the hazards of lagoon treatment releases at this model site. This was done by characterizing the nutrients, organic micropollutants (i.e., pesticides, pharmaceuticals) and standard water quality parameters in the creek prior to and following lagoon discharge events over a number of years (2009-2011). Measured concentrations of nutrients were compared to regulatory expectations and micropollutants were assessed using hazard quotients. As expected, concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species were greatest in sites downstream of the sewage outfall immediately following discharge events. Pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals were detected at concentrations between 0.5 and 90 ng/L Detection frequencies and concentrations matched typical use patterns. Those compounds used predominately for human medicine were detected at downstream sites following discharge events, while those used in an agricultural setting were detected at relatively consistent levels over time at sites both upstream and downstream of the outfall location. Hazard quotients calculated for micropollutants of interest indicated minimal toxicological risk to aquatic biota in the creek, with only erythromycin and diazinon presenting a potential concern to aquatic algae and invertebrates. Concentrations of nutrients exceeded Canadian guideline thresholds during release, but returned to background levels once discharges ceased. Therefore, it is advisable that wastewater treatment and management strategies such as constructed wetlands and/or staggered releases be used in order to minimize the hazard posed by nutrient pulses in Dead Horse Creek and other similar systems.

AB The occurrence and distribution of eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides, and five macrolides were investigated in sewage sludge from 45 wastewater treatment plants in 23 cities in China. Among all the antibiotics considered, quinolones were the dominant antibiotics detected in all samples [total concentrations up to 8905 mu g/kg, dry weight (dw)], followed by macrolides (85.1 mu g/kg, dw), and sulfonamides (22.7 mu g/kg, dw). High concentrations of quinolones in sewage sludge indicated that antibiotics are widely used and extensive pollutants in China. Significant differences were observed for the total concentrations of antibiotics in sludge samples among the 45 WWTPs. To evaluate the potential factors affecting the antibiotic levels in sewage sludge, wastewater and sludge characteristics, as well as the operational conditions and treatment techniques in WWTPs were investigated. The results indicated that the antibiotic levels in sewage sludge depend to a great extent on wastewater characteristics. Significant correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) and total concentrations of antibiotics was also found in studied WWTPs, indicating that TOC could affect the sludge adsorption capability to the antibiotics to some extent. Moreover, the relation between treatment techniques and the total concentrations of antibiotics in sludge showed that antibiotic levels in sludge increased with longer solid retention time.

AB This study firstly explored the photodegradation of carbamazepine, one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals, with tailored BiPO4 nanomaterials. BiPO4 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method. The physicochemical properties of the obtained samples were characterized and the results indicated that both the hydrothermal temperature and reaction time influenced the phase, morphology and optical properties of the BiPO4 catalysts, which may further determine their specific photocatalytic performances. The intrinsic microstructure and optical properties reflected the crystal properties of the catalysts to some extent. The BiPO4 prepared at 180 degrees C for 72 h (BPO-180-72) displayed the best photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation, during which carbamazepine was nearly completely eliminated from ultrapure water after 60 min irradiation. The good photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the synergistic effect of monoclinic phase and relatively ordered morphology of the resulting BiPO4. Particularly, the monoclinic phase was firstly proved to be more active than the hexagonal phase for BiPO4 samples. BPO-180-72 removed approximately 72.4% of carbamazepine from lab-prepared simulated wastewater after 60 min irradiation, suggesting the potential application of this material in wastewater treatment. Ten reaction intermediate products were observed and identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and a tentative reaction pathway was proposed. Results indicated that photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals were the main reactive species for the photodegradation of carbamazepine in the system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are inevitably emitted into the waters. The adverse environmental and human health effects of pharmaceutical residues in water could take place under a very low concentration range; from several mu g/L to ng/L. These are challenges to the global water industries as there is no unit process specifically designed to remove these pollutants. An efficient technology is thus sought to treat these pollutants in water and waste water.
   Methodology/Major Results: A novel chemical, ferrate, was assessed using a standard jar test procedure for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The analytical protocols of pharmaceuticals were standard solid phase extraction together with various instrumentation methods including LC-MS, HPLC-UV and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Ferrate can remove more than 80% of ciprofloxacin (CIP) at ferrate dose of 1 mg Fe/L and 30% of ibuprofen (IBU) at ferrate dose of 2 mg Fe/L. Removal of pharmaceuticals by ferrate was pH dependant and this was in coordinate to the chemical/physical properties of pharmaceuticals. Ferrate has shown higher capability in the degradation of CIP than IBU; this is because CIP has electron-rich organic moieties (EOM) which can be readily degraded by ferrate oxidation and IBU has electron-withdrawing groups which has slow reaction rate with ferrate. Promising performance of ferrate in the treatment of real waste water effluent at both pH 6 and 8 and dose range of 1-5 mg Fe/L was observed. Removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin was the highest among the target compounds (63%), followed by naproxen (43%). On the other hand, n-acetyl sulphamethoxazole was the hardest to be removed by ferrate (8% only).
   Conclusions: Ferrate is a promising chemical to be used to treat pharmaceuticals in waste water. Adjusting operating conditions in terms of the properties of target pharmaceuticals can maximise the pharmaceutical removal efficiency.

AB The aim of this study was to integrally address the uncertainty associated with all the steps used to estimate community drug consumption through the chemical analysis of sewage biomarkers of illicit drugs. Uncertainty has been evaluated for sampling, chemical analysis, stability of drug biomarkers in sewage, back-calculation of drug use (specific case of cocaine), and estimation of population size in a catchment using data collected from a recent Europe-wide investigation and from the available literature. The quality of sampling protocols and analytical measurements has been evaluated by analyzing standardized questionnaires collected from 19 sewage treatments plants (STPs) and the results of an interlaboratory study (ILS), respectively. Extensive reviews of the available literature have been used to evaluate stability of drug biomarkers in sewage and the uncertainty related to back-calculation of cocaine use. Different methods for estimating population size in a catchment have been compared and the variability among the collected data was very high (7-55%). A reasonable strategy to reduce uncertainty was therefore to choose the most reliable estimation case by case. In the other cases, the highest uncertainties are related to the analysis of sewage drug biomarkers (uncertainty as relative standard deviation; RSD: 6-26% from ILS) and to the back-calculation of cocaine use (uncertainty; RSD: 26%). Uncertainty can be kept below 10% in the remaining steps, if specific requirements outlined in this work are considered. For each step, a best practice protocol has been suggested and discussed to reduce and keep to a minimum the uncertainty of the entire procedure and to improve the reliability of the estimates of drug use.

AB A novel aerobic sludge digestion process to stabilize and decrease the amount of excess sludge produced during biological treatment and removal of EDCs sorbed onto sludge during this process is discussed here. Waste activated sludge samples from two different wastewater treatment plants were ozonated for different periods in Erlenmeyer flasks once a day on each of four consecutive days. Flasks were continuously aerated between ozone applications by shaking on an orbital shaker. The residual EDC concentrations in sludge samples were analyzed at the end of digestion periods. An MLVSS reduction of up to 95% was achieved with an ozone dose of only 1.05 g O-3/kg MLSS in this process on the fourth day. During this process destruction of some selected endocrine disrupting compounds, namely diltiazem, carbamazepine, butyl benzyl phthalate, acetaminophen and two natural hormones, estrone and progesterone, which tend to accumulates in sludge, are studied. Over 99% removal of these contaminants were achieved at the end of the fourth day. The analyses were conducted by using LC (ESI) MS/MS after solid phase extraction (SPE). By this process it became possible to save on contact time as well as achieving a bio-solids digestion far exceeding the standard aerobic process and concomitant removal of micropollutants at the expense of minimum ozone dose. The developed process is deemed superior over side-stream ozonation of activated sludge, in that it does not cause reduction in active biomass in the aeration tank. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Drugs in wastewater arise from many sources. For health care, these include excretion and direct disposal (bedside wasting). The present study reports on the dispensing and wasting of 15 controlled substances (CS) at two health care facilities in Albany, NY over a nearly two year period. The study considered measures of ecotoxicity, drug metabolism, excretion and disposal of these CS. Potential alternatives to flushing of CS into wastewaters from healthcare facilities are discussed.
   Drug medication and waste collection records (12,345) included: numbers of drugs dispensed, returned and wasted. Overall, 8528 g of 15 CS were wasted. Three (midazolam, acetaminophen-codeine and fentanyl) accounted for 87.5% of the total wasted. Wasting varied by hospital, 14 CS at the academic medical center hospital and 8 at the surgical care center were wasted. Liquids were more frequently wasted than tablets or pills. Some combination drugs (acetaminophen (APAP)-codeine) were frequently (50% of drug dispensed) wasted while others were less wasted (APAP-hydrocodone-6.3%; APAP-oxycodone-1.3%). The 8 CS judged more hazardous to aquatic life were: APAP-codeine, APAP-hydrocodone, APAP-oxycodone, alprazolam, diazepam, fentanyl, midazolam, and testosterone. Ketamine, morphine, oxycodone and zolpidem were of lesser acute toxicity based on available LC50 values. These CS might provide a therapeutically equivalent alternative to the more environmentally harmful drugs.
   In health care facilities, professionals dispose of CS by bedside wasting into water or other receptacles. This can be avoided by returning CS to the hospital's pharmacy department, thence to a licensed distributor. Study of this process of drug wasting can identify opportunities for process improvements. We found 3 CS (APAP-codeine, midazolam and testosterone) where 1/2 to 1/3 of the drug was wasted and 5 others with 30 to 13% wasted. Knowledge of the adverse impacts from the release of highly toxic drugs into the environment might influence CS selection and disposal alternatives. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been detected in aquatic environments in several countries. Long-term exposure to low levels of antimicrobial agents provides selective pressure, which might alter the sensitivity of bacteria to antimicrobial agents in the environment. Here, we examined FQ levels and the resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to FQs by phenotyping and genotyping. In the aquatic environment in Osaka, Japan, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, enfloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin were detected in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 570 ng L-1. FQ-resistant E. colt were also found. Although no obvious correlation was detected between the concentration of FQs and the presence of FQ-resistant E. coli, FQ-resistant E. coli were detected in samples along with FQs, particularly ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Most FQ-resistant E. coli carried mutations in gyrA, parC, and parE in quinolone resistance-determining regions. No mutations in gyrB were detected in any isolates. Amino acid changes in these isolates were quite similar to those in clinical isolates. Six strains carried the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 and expressed low susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid: the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.25 mu g mL(-1) for ciprofloxacin, and from 8 to 16 mu g mL(-1) for nalidixic acid. This finding confirmed that plasmids containing genes themselves did not confer full resistance to quinolones. Because plasmids are responsible for much the horizontal gene transfer, these genes may transfer and spread in the environment. To our knowledge, is the first report of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 in the aquatic environment, this investigation provides baseline data on antimicrobial resistance profiles in the Osaka area.

AB Antiviral drugs have been recently recognized as one of the emerging contaminants in the environment. These are discharged after therapeutic use through human excretion. Effluent containing high concentration of antiviral drugs discharged from production facilities is also a cause of concern to nearby aquatic bodies. There is an increased interest in their removal because they are highly bioactive. Some antiviral drugs are resistant to conventional methods of degradation, and there is a risk of development of antiviral resistance in humans and animals if exposed repeatedly for long periods. To date, the potential human, animal, and ecological risks associated with the discharge of these antiviral compounds to the environment are not well documented.

AB This study compares two different solar photo-Fenton processes, conventional photo-Fenton at pH3 and modified photo-Fenton at neutral pH with minimal Fe (5 mg L-1) and minimal initial H2O2 (50 mg L-1) concentrations for the degradation of emerging contaminants in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants effluents in solar pilot plant. As Fe precipitates at neutral pH, complexing agents which are able to form photoactive species, do not pollute the environment or increase toxicity have to be used to keep the iron in solution. This study was done using real effluents containing over 60 different contaminants, which were monitored during treatment by liquid chromatography coupled to a hybrid quadrupole/linear ion trap mass analyzer (LC-QTRAP-MS/MS) operating in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Concentrations of the selected contaminants ranged from a few ng L-1 to tens of mu g L-1. It was demonstrated in all cases the removal of over 95% of the contaminants. Photo-Fenton at pH3 provided the best treatment time, but has the disadvantage that the water must be previously acidified. The most promising process was photo-Fenton modified with Ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS), as the pH remained in the neutral range. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study dealt with the interaction of dichloromethane (DCM) with other non-chlorinated organic solvents such as methanol, acetone, toluene, and benzene, which are commonly present in the pharmaceutical wastewater, during biodegradation by mixed bacterial consortium. Non-chlorinated solvents were easily degradable even at an initial concentration of 1,000 mg/L, whereas only 20 mg/L of DCM was degraded when used as sole carbon source. The Monod Inhibition model appears to simulate the single pollutant biodegradation kinetics satisfactorily. In dual substrate systems, low concentrations (100 mg/L) of non-chlorinated solvents did not interfere with the DCM degradation. Non-interaction sum kinetics model was able to simulate the experimental results well in this case. However, high concentrations of non-chlorinated solvents (1,000 mg/L) affected the DCM degradation significantly. There was severe competition between the chlorinated and the non-chlorinated solvents. In this case, competitive inhibition model predicted the experimental results better compared to co-metabolism model. In multiple substrate system also, presence of DCM prolonged the degradation of the other non-chlorinated solvents. However, the presence of non-chlorinated compounds accelerated the degradation of DCM. The results of the present study may be helpful in optimal design of biological systems treating mixed pollutants.

AB The occurrence of 14 mostly used pharmaceuticals from different classes (antibiotics, beta-blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stimulant) and hormones in surface water in Istanbul, Turkey was investigated in this study. An important drinking water source, Buyukcekmece Lake and main rivers flowing into the lake were selected for the monitoring of the compounds. Sampling was conducted five different times in a year in order to observe seasonal changes. A rapid, robust and sensitive method using solid phase extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer was established for quantification of both pharmaceuticals and hormones. Limit of quantifications were between 0.5 and 1.1 ng L-1. Recoveries were between 72-119% and 61-98% for ultra-pure water and for surface water, respectively. All selected compounds were detected at least once in the samples. Some pharmaceuticals were detected as high as a few of micrograms per liter levels in the rivers. Most frequently detected compounds were caffeine and antibiotics (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole). Synthetic hormone (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) was detected only 4 times corresponding least detected compound in whole sampling period. Field data confirms that amoxicillin is more prone to degradation with respect to other antibiotics. Estrone and 17-beta estradiol are converted to estriol by natural processes in surface water.

AB A significant percentage of bisphenol A and nonylphenol removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants relies on biodegradation. Nonetheless, incomplete information is available concerning their degradation pathways performed by microbial communities in activated sludge systems. Hydroquinone dioxygenase (HQDO) is a specific degradation marker enzyme, involved in bisphenol A and nonylphenol biodegradation, and it can be produced by axenic cultures of the bacterium Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP3. Proteomics, a technique based on the analysis of microbial community proteins, was applied to this strain. The bacterium proteome map was obtained and a HQDO subunit was successfully identified. Additionally, the reliability of the applied proteomics protocol was evaluated in activated sludge samples. Proteins belonging to Sphingomonas were searched at decreasing biomass ratios, i.e. serially diluting the bacterium in activated sludge. The protein patterns were compared and Sphingomonas proteins were discriminated against the ones from sludge itself on 2D-gels. The detection limit of the applied protocol was defined as 10(-3) g TTNP3 g(-1) total suspended solids (TSSs). The results proved that proteomics can be a promising methodology to assess the presence of specific enzymes in activated sludge samples, however improvements of its sensitivity are still needed.

AB Chlortetracycline (CTC) is a hazardous material in aquatic environments. This study was focused on optimization of photocatalytic ozonation processes for removal of CTC from wastewater at pH 2.2 and 7.0. In this study, the tested processes for CTC removal were arranged from the least efficient to the most efficient as: UV, UV/TiO2, O-3, O-3/UV and O-3/UV/TiO2. Ozonation efficiency was due to ozone affinity for electron-rich sites on the CTC molecule. In the O-3/UV and O-3/UV/TiO2 processes, efficiency was increased by the photolysis of CTC and generation of (OH)-O-center dot. At pH 7.0, all the processes were more efficient for CTC degradation than at pH 2.2 due to CTC speciation, ozone decay to (OH)-O-center dot and the attractions between ionized CTC and TiO2 particles. UV/O-3 at pH 7.0 showed an additive effect while other combination processes showed a synergistic effect that resulted in higher rates of reactions than the sums of individual reaction rates. The TOC removal ranged from 8% to 41% after one hour of reaction, with the above-mentioned order of efficiency. The biodegradability increased rapidly during the early minutes of the reaction. A reaction time of 10-15 min was sufficient for near maximum biodegradability, making these processes good pretreatments for the biological processes.

AB The stability of 24 chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and some agrochemicals on extraction media was evaluated by preloading them onto Oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) followed by storage at 20 degrees C over time. After 20 months, the average loss was 11% on POCIS, with only 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and gemfibrozil showing a statistically significant decline compared with initial concentrations. Losses on SPE cartridges were below 19%, with an average loss of 9%. In addition to laboratory spiked samples, multiple POCIS deployed in wastewater-impacted surface waters and SPE extracts of these waters were stored in their original coextracted matrix for nearly two years with minimal observed losses. Errors from typical sampling, handling, and concentration estimates from POCIS sampling rates were typically +/- 15 to 30% relative standard deviation, so observed storage losses are minimal for most POCIS applications. While losses during storage on SPE cartridges for 20 months were small but statistically significant for many compounds, addition of labeled internal standards prior to freezing should correct for such losses. Thus, storage of processed water samples for analysis of polar organic pollutants is viable for archival purposes or studies for which samples cannot be analyzed in the short term. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The presence of the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the environment is of increasing concern due to the endocrine disruption of aquatic organisms. Incomplete removal from wastewater (WW) is one of the main sources of EE2 in aquatic ecosystems, thus improving processes like biological WW treatment/activated sludge (AS) is becoming significantly important. There are opposing results regarding EE2 biodegradability by AS; one discrepancy is the efficacy of heterotrophic bacteria. This research demonstrated the ability of heterotrophs commonly present in AS (B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, R. equi, R. erythropolis, R. rhodochrous, R. zopfii) to remove EE2. R. rhodochrous was the most successful with no detectable EE2 after 48 h; the other bacteria achieved 21%-61% EE2 removal. No additive or synergistic effects were observed due to the combination of the bacterial cultures with maximum EE2 removals of 43% after 300 h. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal efficiency of 22 selected trace organic contaminants by sequential application of granular activated carbon (GAC) and simultaneous application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) with membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared in this study. Both sequential application of GAC following MBR treatment (MBR-GAC) and simultaneous application of PAC within MBR (PAC-MBR) achieved improved removal (over 95%) of seven hydrophilic and biologically persistent compounds, which were less efficiently removed by MBR-only treatment (negligible to 70%). However, gradual breakthrough of these compounds occurred over an extended operation period. Charged compounds, particularly, fenoprop and diclofenac, demonstrated the fastest breakthrough (complete and 50-70%, in MBR-GAC and PAC-MBR, respectively). Based on a simple comparison from the long-term performance stability and activated carbon usage points of view, PAC-MBR appears to be a better option than MBR-GAC treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The chiral signature of the antidepressant venlafaxine was used in this study to gain insight into biological attenuation processes and to differentiate abiotic and biotic transformation processes in water. Laboratory scale experiments revealed that sorption and phototransformation processes were not enantioselective while venlafaxine was enantioselectively biotransformed into O-desmethylvenlafaxine. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) variations of venlafaxine appeared to be proportional to its microbial fractional conversion. Enantioselective biotransformation of venlafaxine was also investigated in a eutrophic French river. Venlafaxine was found to be racemic at the output of the main wastewater treatment plant discharging into the river, independently of the sampling date during the year. An analysis of EF variations might provide evidence of biodegradation along a 30 km river stretch. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrothermal treatment involving the oxidation and gasification of sewage sludge and pharmaceutical wastewater samples has been carried out in batch autoclave reactor. The efficiency of the oxidation processes measured in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) and total solids (TS) removal showed that effective sample treatments were achieved at moderately low temperatures of 350-450 degrees C. More than 90% TOC removal was achieved in all samples, with samples with lower organic contents reaching above 99% TOC removal. A maximum of 78% TS removal was achieved due to the high initial ash contents of the samples. Alkaline hydrothermal gasification of the samples with very high TOC contents yielded gas products rich in hydrogen gas and methane. Due to high concentrations of acetonitrile in some of the samples, the yields of methane were high, giving calorific values of the product gases of up to 35 MJ/m(3) in some samples; however, the gasification process resulted in lower TOC destruction compared to the oxidation process.

AB Low levels of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in aquatic environments worldwide, but their human and ecological health risks associated with low dose environmental exposure is largely unknown due to the large number of these compounds and a lack of information. Therefore prioritization and ranking methods are needed for screening target compounds for research and risk assessment. Previous efforts to rank pharmaceutical compounds have often focused on occurrence data and have paid less attention to removal mechanisms such as human metabolism. This study proposes a simple prioritization approach based on number of prescriptions and toxicity information, accounting for metabolism and wastewater treatment removal, and can be applied to unmeasured compounds. The approach was performed on the 200 most-prescribed drugs in the US in 2009. Our results showed that under-studied compounds such as levothyroxine and montelukast sodium received the highest scores, suggesting the importance of removal mechanisms in influencing the ranking, and the need for future environmental research to include other less-studied but potentially harmful pharmaceutical compounds.

AB The occurrence of sixty pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), twenty metabolites and eight personal care products (PCPs) in the aquatic environment in Spain and their predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) were calculated and compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) obtained from relevant published research. The occurrence in the aquatic environment was calculated through a mass balance approach considering the following: the number of pharmaceutical prescriptions issued, the amount of pharmaceutical discharged without consumption, consumption, self-medication, pharmacokinetics, treatment in wastewater facilities and discharged to aquatic environment. The estimation of consumption of active compounds of pharmaceuticals was conducted by at least one of the following methodologies: number of commercial packages sold, data for the number of defined daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD), and pattern of treatment Comparison of these methodologies for some compounds showed similar estimated consumption ranges. The highest pharmaceutical occurrence in the aquatic environment was for acetaminophen glucuronide, Galaxolide (R), Iso-E-super (R), acetaminophen, valsartan, amoxicillin, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, iopromide, omeprazole, carbamazepine 10, 11-epoxide, iopamidol, salicylic beta-D-O-glucuronide acid, Tonalide (R), acetylsalicylic add (ASA), clarithromycin and iohexol, with releases between 5 and 600 t y(-1). The relation of PEC/MEC was calculated for 58% of the compounds under study, and 64.7% of them had PEC/MEC ratios between 05 and 2. PEC values were mostly overestimated (57.4%). The predicted concentrations for pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) that had a high occurrence in the aquatic environment were very close to the measured concentrations. This research provides information that had not been calculated and analyzed previously, at least for Spain. Estimation of the PECs for pharmaceutical, personal care products and metabolites is a useful tool for identifying compounds that should be considered for environmental concern, and such estimations could be used to improve environmental risk assessment studies.

AB Current wastewater treatment processes are insufficient at removing many pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater and it is necessary to identify the chemical characteristics that determine their fate. Models that predict the fate of various chemicals lack verification using in situ data, particularly for PPCPs. BIOWIN4 is a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model that has been proposed to estimate the removal of PPCPs from wastewater, but data verifying the accuracy of its predictions is limited. In this study, the in situ soluble and suspended solid concentrations were assessed from raw influent, primary effluent, secondary effluent, and final effluent for 54 PPCPs and hormones over six dates. When assessing the removal efficiency across the different stages of the WWTP, the majority of the removal occurred across the secondary treatment process for the majority of the compounds. The primary treatment and disinfection process had limited impacts on the removal of most PPCPs. Sorption to solids was found to influence the removal for compounds with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient greater than 4.5 across the secondary treatment process. For other compounds, the removal of PPCPs across the secondary treatment process was significantly correlated with the biodegradation predicted by BIOWIN4. Removal efficiencies across the aerobic secondary treatment process were predicted by integrating BIOWIN4 into pseudo-first order kinetics of PPCPs and these predicted values were compared to the in situ data. This study determines that under a certain set of operating conditions, two chemical characteristics the expected hydrophobic interaction and the modeled biological degradation from BIOWIN4 were found to predict the removal of highly degradable and recalcitrant PPCPs from a wastewater secondary treatment process.

AB Comprehensive study on the occurrence and fate of several classes of antimicrobials, including sulfonamides, trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in Croatian municipal wastewaters was performed using an integrated approach, which comprised analysis of both dissolved and particulate fractions. A nation-wide screening showed ubiquitous occurrence of human-use antimicrobials in raw wastewater samples with the total concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 mu g/L, while veterinary antimicrobials were typically present in much lower concentrations (<100 ng/L). The percentage of the particulate fraction in raw wastewater varied significantly depending on the type of the antimicrobial and the load of suspended solids. A detailed study of the mass flows of dissolved and particulate antimicrobials, performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb, allowed an improved assessment of the biological and physico-chemical removal mechanisms of investigated compounds during the conventional activated sludge treatment. The overall removal efficiencies of antimicrobials from the water phase were rather variable, ranging from 0% for trimethoprim to 85% for norfloxacin. A significant percentage of fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin) was associated with the primary and excess secondary sludge, explaining 14-77% of the total removal. The removal, which could be attributed to biological transformation, was relatively poor for all antimicrobials, exceeding 30% only for SMX (32%) and clarithromycin (55%). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The fate of 14 antidepressants along with their respective N-desmethyl metabolites and the anticonvulsive drug carbamazepine was examined in a primary sewage treatment plant (STP) and following advanced treatments with ozone (O-3). The concentrations of each pharmaceutical compound were determined in raw sewage, effluent and sewage sludge samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The occurrence of antidepressant by-products formed in treated effluent after ozonation was also investigated.
   Results: Current primary treatments using physical and chemical processes removed little of the compounds (mean removal efficiency: 19%). Experimental sorption coefficients (K-d) of each studied compounds were also calculated. Sorption of venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, and carbamazepine on sludge was assumed to be negligible (log K-d <= 2), but higher sorption behavior can be expected for sertraline (log K-d >= 4). Ozonation treatment with O-3 (5 mg/L) led to a satisfactory mean removal efficiency of 88% of the compounds. Screening of the final ozone-treated effluent samples by high resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) did confirm the presence of related N-oxide by-products.
   Conclusion: Effluent ozonation led to higher mean removal efficiencies than current primary treatment, and therefore represented a promising strategy for the elimination of antidepressants in urban wastewaters. However, the use of O-3 produced by-products with unknown toxicity.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts have been shown to be effective at degrading a wide range of organic micropollutants during short-term batch experiments conducted under ideal laboratory solution conditions (e.g., deionized water). However, little research has been performed regarding longer-term photocatalyst performance in more complex matrices representative of contaminated water sources (e.g., wastewater effluent, groundwater). Here, a benchtop continuous-flow reactor was developed for the purpose of studying the activity, inhibition, and deactivation of immobilized TiO2 photocatalysts during water treatment applications. As a demonstration, degradation of four pharmaceutical micropollutants (iopromide, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine) was monitored in both a pH-buffered electrolyte solution and a biologically treated wastewater effluent (WWE) to study the effects of non-target constituents enriched in the latter matrix. Reactor performance was shown to be stable over 7 d when treating micropollutants in buffered electrolyte, with 7-d averaged k(obs) values (acetaminophen = 0.97 +/- 0.10 h(-1): carbamazepine = 0.50 +/- 0.04 h(-1); iopromide = 0.49 +/- 0.03 h(-1); sulfamethoxazole = 0.79 +/- 0.06 h(-1)) agreeing closely with measurements from short-term circulating batch reactions. When reactor influent was switched to WWE, treatment efficiencies decreased to varying degrees (acetaminophen = 40% decrease; carbamazepine = 60%; iopromide = 78%; sulfamethoxazole = 54%). A large fraction of the catalyst activity was recovered upon switching back to the buffered electrolyte influent after 4d. suggesting that much of the observed decrease resulted from reversible inhibition by non-target constituents (e.g., scavenging of photocatalyst-generated (OH)-O-center dot). However, there was also a portion of the decrease in activity that was not recovered, indicating WWE constituents also contributed to photocatalyst deactivation (acetaminophen = 6% deactivation; carbamazepine = 24%; iopromide = 16%; sulfamethoxazole = 25%). Experiments conducted using pretreated WWE and synthetic WWE mimic solutions indicated that both effluent organic matter and inorganic constituents in WWE contributed to the observed photocatalyst inhibition/deactivation. Analysis of immobilized TiO2 thin films after 4 d of continuous treatment of the WWE matrix indicated minor deterioration of the porous film and formation of surface precipitates enriched in Al and Ca. Results demonstrated the marked influence of non-target constituents present in complex matrices on long-term photocatalyst activity and highlighted the need for further study of this important issue to advance the development of practical photocatalytic water treatment technologies.

AB The visible light photocatalytic degradation of propranolol was studied using cerium doped titanium dioxide, a catalyst that showed an increased light absorption in the visible region. The experiments were carried out in ultrapure water and in a biologically treated wastewater from the secondary effluent of a treatment plant spiked with propranolol. The best results were obtained for a cerium loading of 0.5 wt.% and a bulk catalyst concentration of 0.14 g/L, with which propranolol became essentially depleted after 1.5 h of irradiation. The extent of mineralization reached 17.4% after 6 h on stream under the same conditions. Both oxidation on catalyst holes and reaction with hydroxyl radicals contribute to propranolol depletion, but for the reaction conditions tested in this study, the first mechanism predominated and accounted for 60% of the propranolol rate constant. The runs performed in wastewater matrix led to a very low photocatalytic rate compared with pure water, which was attributed to the presence of radical scavengers and competing substances. Over thirty reaction intermediates were detected by means of exact mass measurements performed by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) based on the characteristic fragmentation of oxidation by-products. Their relative abundance was also assessed in catalytic and non-catalytic runs. The most abundant transformation products could be attributed to the cleavage of the ether bond of propranolol. Other compounds detected derived from the addition of hydroxyl groups to the aromatic nuclei or to the ring-opening attack of hydroxyl radicals on the naphthol moiety. Finally, the toxicity of oxidized mixtures was determined using the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Although the toxicity of treated mixtures tended to decrease as propranolol was depleted, mixtures treated in pure water may lead to the accumulation of toxic transformation products.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are biologically recalcitrant chemicals that are often detected in wastewater-impacted environments at higher concentrations than other pharmaceutical micropollutants of concern. Diatrizoate is an anionic ICM that is especially resistant to conventional wastewater and drinking water treatment processes. This study examined the aqueous photocatalytic treatment of diatrizoate using nanophase titanium dioxide (TiO2). Experiments demonstrated that diatrizoate can be degraded in aqueous TiO2 suspensions illuminated with ultraviolet-A (UVA) light. In oxic solutions, diatrizoate degraded principally via oxidation by adsorbed hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), releasing iodine substituents stoichiometrically, but causing little mineralization of organic carbon and nitrogen. Introduction of (OH)-O-center dot scavengers significantly slowed the rate of photocatalytic degradation. At circumneutral pH, diatrizoate was oxidized much more slowly than iopromide, a nonionic ICM, in part because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged TiO2 surface; increased rates of oxidation observed at lower pH conditions can be attributed to more favorable diatrizoate-TiO2 sorptive interactions. Experiments also demonstrated that diatrizoate was degraded at appreciable rates in anoxic solutions, and reductive dehalogenation products are identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The higher selectivity of reductive processes suggests a promising strategy for targeted treatment of recalcitrant ICM in organic-rich matrices like wastewater effluent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The prescribed use of pharmaceuticals can result in unintended, unwelcomed, and potentially adverse consequences for the environment and for those not initially targeted for treatment. Medication usage frequently results in the collateral introduction to the environment (via excretion and bathing) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bioactive metabolites, and reversible conjugates. Imprudent prescribing and non-compliant patient behavior drive the accumulation of unused medications, which pose major public health risks from diversion as well as risks for the environment from unsound disposal, such as flushing to sewers. The prescriber has the unique wherewithal to reduce each of these risks by modifying various aspects of the practice of prescribing. By incorporating consideration of the potential for adverse environmental impacts into the practice of prescribing, patient care also could possibly be improved and public health better protected.
   Although excretion of an API is governed by its characteristic pharmacokinetics, this variable can be somewhat controlled by the prescriber in selecting APIs possessing environment-friendly excretion profiles and in selecting the lowest effective dose. This paper presents the first critical examination of the multi-faceted role of drug dose in reducing the ambient levels of APIs in the environment and in reducing the incidence of drug wastage, which ultimately necessitates disposal of leftovers. Historically, drug dose has been actively excluded from consideration in risk mitigation strategies for reducing ambient API levels in the environment. Personalized adjustment of drug dose also holds the potential for enhancing therapeutic outcomes while simultaneously reducing the incidence of adverse drug events and in lowering patient healthcare costs. Optimizing drug dose is a major factor in improving the sustainability of health care. The prescriber needs to be cognizant that the "patient" encompasses the environment and other "bystanders," and that prescribed treatments can have unanticipated, collateral impacts that reach far beyond the healthcare setting.

AB Urine constitutes only about 1% of domestic sewage but contains 50% or more of the excreted nutrients and chemicals like hormones and pharmaceutical residues. Urine diverting toilet (UDT) systems can be considered a more sustainable alternative to wastewater management because they allow nutrient recycling, reduce water use, and allow source-separation of hormones and chemicals that can harm the environment. An online survey was conducted to determine whether UDTs are acceptable to the general public in Hawaii and if attitudes and perceptions towards it and human waste (HW) recycling vary with age, sex, level of education, religious affiliation, ethnicity, and employment status. The survey was also intended to detect possible drivers and barriers for the UDTs. Variations on variables were tested at 5% significance (p = 0.05) level (Chi-squared test or ANOVA) and considered significantly different if the p-value was less than 0.05. The results were encouraging as more than 60% are willing to pay extra for the UDT, while only 22% knew that such systems existed. No statistically significant difference was found between males and females on all survey questions at the 5% level. However, females had higher willingness to pay (WTP) than males and WTP increased with age and income. The WTP of Caucasians was higher than Asians and differed significantly. Some respondents expressed concern about the legal provisions for recycling of HW. The survey results indicate that with a public education program, it is possible that most people would be willing to adopt UDTs and HW recycling with incurred societal benefits of reduced water and fertilizer use, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and collection of micropollutants at the source to prevent their entry into waterways. Because of the small sample size (N = 132, 13% response rate) the survey is not representative but may be indicative of the general attitude of Hawaiian people. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic pharmaceutical agent commonly found in wastewater, is highly recalcitrant to standard wastewater treatment practices. This study investigated the mixture toxicity of carbamazepine transformation products formed during ultraviolet (UV) photolysis using three standard ecotoxicity assays (representing bacteria, algae and crustaceans). UV-treatment of 6 mg L-1 carbamazepine solution was carried out over a 120 min period and samples were removed periodically over the course of the experiment. Quantification results confirmed the degradation of carbamazepine throughout the treatment period, together with concurrent increases in acridine and acridone concentrations. Ecotoxicity was shown to increase in parallel with carbamazepine degradation indicating that the mixture of degradation products formed was more toxic than the parent compound, and all three ecotoxicity endpoints were still inhibited >60% relative to control populations upon dosing with 90+min UV-treated carbamazepine solution. Single compound toxicity testing also confirmed the higher toxicity of measured degradation products relative to the parent compound. These results show that transformation products considerably more toxic than carbamazepine itself may be produced during UV-treatment of wastewater effluents and/or photo-induced degradation of carbamazepine in natural waters. This study highlights the need to consider mixture toxicity and the formation and persistence of toxicologically relevant transformation products when assessing the environmental risks posed by pharmaceutical compounds.

AB Sulfonamides are one of the most frequently used antibiotics worldwide. Therefore, mitigation processes such as abiotic or biotic degradation are of interest. Photodegradation and biodegradation are the potentially significant removal mechanisms for pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments. The photolysis of sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP) using a medium pressure Hg-lamp was evaluated in three different media: Millipore water pH 6.1 (MW), effluent from sewage treatment plant pH 7.6 (STP), and buffered demineralized water pH 7.4 (BDW). Identification of transformation products (TPs) was performed by LC-UV-MS/MS. The biodegradation of SMP using two tests from the OECD series was studied: Closed Bottle test (OECD 301 D), and Manometric Respirometry test (OECD 301 F). In biodegradation tests, it was found that SMP was not readily biodegradable so it may pose a risk to the environment. The results showed that SMP was removed completely within 128 min of irradiation in the three media, and the degradation rate was different for each investigated type of water. However, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not removed in BDW and only little DOC removal was observed in MW and STP, thus indicating the formation of TPs. Analysis by LC-UV-MS/MS revealed new TPs formed. The hydroxylation of SMP represents the main photodegradation pathway. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage treatment plants (STP) are an important source of short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) to the ambient environment through discharge of effluent and application of sludge. In this work, a field study was conducted to determine the behavior and possible removal of SCCPs during the sewage treatment process in an advanced municipal STP in Beijing, China. SCCPs were detected in all sewage water and sludge samples, and 97% of the initial mass loading in raw sewage was found to be associated with suspended matter. The total concentrations in raw influent, tertiary effluent, and dewatered sludge were 184 +/- 19 ng/L, 27 +/- 6 ng/L, and 15.6 +/- 1.4 mu g/g dry weight (d.w.), respectively. The dissolved concentrations of total SCCPs (Sigma SCCPs) significantly decreased during mechanical, biological, and chemical treatments. SCCP homologue profiles in aqueous phase were distinctly different from those in solid phase. Along the treatment process, the relative abundance of shorter chain and lower chlorinated congeners gradually increased in sewage water, but no obvious variations of homologue profiles were found in sludge. Mass flow analysis indicated, the removal efficiency in aqueous phase for Sigma SCCPs was 82.2%, and the congener-specific removal efficiencies were positively related to their solid water partition coefficients (K-d). Mass balance results indicated that 0.8% and 72.6% of the initial SCCP mass loading were ultimately found in the effluents and dewatered sludge, respectively, while the remaining 26.6% was lost mainly due to biodegradation/biotransformation. It was suggested that the activated sludge system including basic anaerobic anoxic aerobic processes played an effective role in removing SCCPs from the wastewater, while the sorption to sludge by hydrophobic interactions was an important fate of SCCPs during the sewage treatment.

AB We developed a multiresidue method for the target and suspect screening of more than 180 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, biocides, additives, corrosion inhibitors, musk fragrances, UV light stabilizers, and industrial chemicals in sediments. Sediment samples were freeze-dried, extracted by pressurized liquid extraction, and cleaned up by liquid liquid partitioning. The quantification and identification of target compounds with a broad range of physicochemical properties (log K-ow 0-12) was carried out by liquid chromatography followed by electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) coupled to high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). The overall method average recoveries and precision are 103% and 9% (RSD), respectively. The method detection limits range from 0.010 to 4 ng/g(dw), while limits of quantification range from 0.030 to 14 ng/g(dw). The use of APPI as an alternative ionization source helped to distinguish two isomeric musk fragrances by means of different ionization behavior. The method was demonstrated on sediment cores from Lake Greifensee located in northeastern Switzerland. The results show that biocides, musk fragrances, and other personal care products were the most frequently detected compounds with concentrations ranging from pg/g(dw) to ng/g(dw), whereas none of the targeted pharmaceuticals were found. The concentrations of many urban contaminants originating from wastewater correlate with the highest phosphorus input into the lake as a proxy for treatment efficiency. HAMS enabled a retrospective analysis of the full-scan data acquisition allowing the detection of suspected compounds like quaternary ammonium surfactants, the biocide triclocarban, and the tentative identification of further compounds without reference standards, among others transformation products of triclosan and triclocarban.

AB The concentrations of nine emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (ibuprofen, IBF; naproxen, NPX; diclofenac, DCF; ketoprofen, KFN) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (triclosan, TCS; bisphenol, BPA; nonylphenol, NP; nonylphenol monoethoxylate, NP1EO; nonylphenol diethoxylate, NP2EO), were determined in wastewater and sludge samples of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Greece. Average concentrations in raw and treated wastewater ranged from 0.39 (KFN) to 12.52 mu g L-1 (NP) and from <LOD (IBF) to 0.80 mu g L-1 (DCF), respectively. A significant part of nonylphenols (NPs) and TCS in influent wastewater was bound to the particulate phase, while PhACs and BPA were mainly detected in the aqueous phase. Removal of target compounds during wastewater treatment ranged between 39% (DCF) and 100% (IBF). Except of DCF and BPA, similar removal efficiencies were observed in both WWTPs and no effect of WWTP's size and operational conditions was noticed. Use of mass balances showed that accumulation on sludge was a significant removal mechanism for NPs and TCS, while biodegradation/biotransformation was the major mechanism for the other compounds. Sampling of raw and digested sludge demonstrated that IBF and NPX are significantly removed (>80%) during anaerobic digestion, whereas removal of EDCs was lower, ranging up to 55% for NP1EO.

AB Photocatalytic experiments on the pharmaceutical pollutant carbamazepine (CBZ) were conducted using sol-gel nitrogen-doped TiO2-coated glass slides under a solar simulator. CBZ was stable to photodegradation under direct solar irradiation. No CBZ sorption to the catalyst surface was observed, as further confirmed by surface characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of N-doped TiO2 surfaces. When exposing the catalyst surface to natural organic matter (NOM), an excess amount of carbon was detected relative to controls, which is consistent with NOM remaining on the catalyst surface. The catalyst surface charge was negative at pH values from 4 to 10 and decreased with increasing pH, correlated with enhanced CBZ removal with increasing medium pH in the range of 5-9. A dissolved organic carbon concentration of 5 mg/L resulted in similar to 20% reduction in CBZ removal, probably due to competitive inhibition of the photocatalytic degradation of CBZ. At alkalinity values corresponding to CaCO3 addition at 100 mg/L, an over 40% decrease in CBZ removal was observed. A 35% reduction in CBZ occurred in the presence of surface water compared to complete suppression of the photocatalytic process in wastewater effluent. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical compounds such as ketoprofen, diclofenac and atenolol are frequently detected at relatively high concentrations in secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, it is important to assess their transformation kinetics and intermediates in subsequent disinfection processes, such as direct ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The photodegradation kinetics of these compounds using a medium pressure (MP) lamp was assessed in pure water, as well as in filtered and unfiltered treated wastewater. Ketoprofen had the highest time- and fluence-based rate constants in all experiments, whereas atenolol had the lowest values, which is consistent with the corresponding decadic molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield. The fluence-based rate constants of all compounds were evaluated in filtered and unfiltered wastewater matrices as well as in pure water. Furthermore, transformation products of ketoprofen, diclofenac and atenolol were identified and monitored throughout the irradiation experiments, and photodegradation pathways were proposed for each compound. This enabled the identification of persistent transformation products, which are potentially discharged from WWTP disinfection works employing UV photolysis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Changes of fluorescence excitation emission matrixes (EEM) of wastewater caused by Fenton process (FP) and Fenton-like process (FLP) were quantified in this study. Their association with the generation of hydroxyl radicals, formation of oxidation products of effluent organic matter (EfOM) and degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were examined as well. Both FP and FLP caused a consistent decrease of EfOM fluorescence. This decrease was most prominent in the EEM region associated with soluble microbial products (SMPs). Measurements of the consumption of the radical probe pCBA and calculations of OH center dot radicals exposures showed that relative changes of EEM quantified using alternative parameters (such as humic region response or peak intensity relative change) were predictive of OH center dot exposures irrespective of whether the wastewater was treated with FP or FLP at any Fe doses and treatment times. The generation of EfOM oxidation products such as formate, oxalate and acetate was also correlated with EEM changes. Similar observations were obtained for PPCPs whose removal was interpreted based on first-order kinetics. Values of selected parameters representing correlations between PPCPs oxidation and EfOM fluorescence decreases were strongly correlated with the intrinsic rates of the oxidation of trace-level organic species by OH center dot radicals.

AB Fifty-four different organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, corrosion inhibitors and other typical wastewater compounds such as caffeine are repeatedly analyzed in approximately fifty groundwater observation points in a complex faulted and fractured carbonate aquifer system consisting of three spring catchment areas. With the applied HPLC-MS/MS method, achieving method quantification limits (MQL) of 12-28 ng L-1, forty-four of the OMPs are detected in groundwater. Regarding the vertical distribution in the aquifer system the highest variety of OMPs occurs in the shallow aquifer.
   Most frequently detected compounds are atrazine together with the metabolites of several triazines, desethylatrazine (DEA) and desisopropylatrazine (DIA), the corrosion inhibitors 1H-benzotriazole and tolytriazoles and as pharmaceutical residues the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine as well as the analgesic drug phenazone. Median OMP concentrations are in the range of 20-40 ng L-1 with occasionally and locally higher concentrations of up to 6000 ng L-1.
   Defined combinations of OMPs occur repeatedly in the same observation wells and allow to distinguish different input functions. The comparison of detection frequency with the number of prescribed doses gives information about the specific persistence of pharmaceuticals. The analgesic phenazone exhibits a peculiar high detection frequency, although it is recently not prescribed in significant amounts. The detection of the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen (6-17 ng L-1) in a groundwater flow system is reported for the first time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of advanced oxidative processes based on photocatalytic ozonation (O-3, UV, UV/O-3, UV/O-3/Fe2+ 50 mg L-1 and 150 mg L-1) in the treatment of hospital laundry wastewaters. The analysis of the investigated wastewater revealed high chemical oxygen demand (COD - 3343.8 mg L-1), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5 - 1906.4 mg L-1), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN - 79.8 mg L-1) and Daphnia magna toxicity (EC50 = 1.73). Genotoxic effects were also detected for Minim cepa. Reductions of some parameters occurred after photocatalytic ozonation. The UV/O-3/Fe2+ 150 mg L-1 method was more efficient in reducing COD (59.1%), BOD5 (503%) and TKN (86.8%). There was significant reduction (p<0.05) in D. magna toxicity, O-3 (EC50=47.3%), UV (EC50=50.6%) and UV/O-3/Fe2+ 150 mg L-1 (EC50=45.4%) processes. Normalization of the mitotic index and reduction of micronucleated cells were observed in A. cepa after the treatments. Results demonstrate that these methods were efficient in the degradation of hospital laundry wastewaters, representing a thriving alternative for the removal of pollutants that cause toxicity and genotoxicity.

AB Significant quantities of antibiotics are used in all parts of the globe to treat diseases with bacterial origins. After ingestion, antibiotics are excreted by the patient and transmitted in due course to the aquatic environment. This study examined temporal fluctuations (monthly time scale) in antibiotic sources (ambulatory sales and data from a hospital dispensary) for Lausanne, Switzerland. Source variability (i.e., antibiotic consumption, monthly data for 2006-2010) were examined in detail for nine antibiotics - azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, from which two main conclusions were reached. First, some substances - azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin - displayed high seasonality in their consumption, with the winter peak being up to three times higher than the summer minimum. This seasonality in consumption resulted in seasonality in Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs). In addition, the seasonality in PECs was also influenced by that in the base wastewater flow. Second, the contribution of hospitals to the total load of antibiotics reaching the Lausanne Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) fluctuated markedly on a monthly time scale, but with no seasonal pattern detected. That is, there was no connection between fluctuations in ambulatory and hospital consumption for the substances investigated.

AB A reactive transport model is employed to evaluate the potential for contamination of drinking water wells by surface water pollution. The model considers various geologic settings, includes sorption and degradation processes and is tested by comparison with data from a tracer experiment where fluorescein dye injected in a river is monitored at nearby drinking water wells. Three compounds were considered: an older pesticide MCPP (Mecoprop) which is mobile and relatively persistent, glyphosate (Roundup), a newer biodegradable and strongly sorbing pesticide, and its degradation product AMPA. Global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method is employed to identify the dominant model parameters. Results show that the characteristics of clay aquitards (degree of fracturing and thickness), pollutant properties and well depths are crucial factors when evaluating the risk of drinking water well contamination from surface water. This study suggests that it is unlikely that glyphosate in streams can pose a threat to drinking water wells, while MCPP in surface water can represent a risk: MCPP concentration at the drinking water well can be up to 7% of surface water concentration in confined aquifers and up to 10% in unconfined aquifers. Thus, the presence of confining clay aquitards may not prevent contamination of drinking water wells by persistent compounds in surface water. Results are consistent with data on pesticide occurrence in Denmark where pesticides are found at higher concentrations at shallow depths and close to streams. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ozonation and ozone-based advanced oxidation processes have been shown to be effective in the oxidation of several pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) routinely detected in surface waters. Under typical operating conditions of these processes, most of the parent compound oxidized is expected to lead to the formation of transformation products (TPs). For a target ozone exposure, the resulting hydroxyl radical exposure depends on the water matrix or process chosen (e. g. peroxone) which in turn may influence the degradation pathway and the TPs formed. This study was undertaken to examine the expected impact that varying ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures may have on TP formation from the oxidation of PhACs during typical drinking water ozonation. Two representative PhACs were selected for the study. Carbamazepine was chosen to represent PhACs with a fast reaction rate with ozone (k(O3) > 10(4) M (1) s (1)) and bezafibrate was chosen to represent PhACs with a slow to moderate reaction rate with ozone (k(O3) < 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). The results show that under varying ozone and hydroxyl exposure scenarios examined, the major oxidation pathway for the parent compound was dominated by reaction with ozone for carbamazepine while for bezafibrate it varied.

AB Metronidazole (MNZ) is an antibiotic pollutant with a high occurrence in the ambient medium. In this study, the anode material Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce prepared in the lab was employed to investigate the feasibility of the electrochemical process to treat antibiotic in wastewater. The result showed that metronidazole could be effectively removed using Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce. The degradation efficiency of 88% was obtained under the current density 1.6 mA cm(-2), pH = 5.6 (not adjusted), electrolyte (Na2SO4) concentration of 0.2 M for electrolysis 2 h. The removal percentage was higher by 17% compared with the control when the bare Ti was applied. Meanwhile, the energy consumption on Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce was about one-seventh of that on Ti. The characterization of the material was conducted by the thermal field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Ti/SnO2-Sb-Ce anode displayed compact, multi-porous morphology and good redox reversibility. The influencing factors such as current density, pH, concentration of Na2SO4, initial MNZ concentration were studied to obtain main factors and optimum conditions. In addition, a preliminary study on the mechanism of the electro-oxidation was carried out. The results demonstrate that chemisorbed oxygen has a dominant role in MNZ removal.

AB Environmentally sustainable solutions for wastewater management including the improvement of water quality and water recycling are considered key priority areas globally. The challenges facing our water resources are unprecedented due to the presence of organic and inorganic pollutants derived from numerous anthropogenic activities. This situation has been further complicated by emerging persistent contaminants such as pharmaceuticals which possess low biodegradability and resistance to chemical and biological treatments. Excretion of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites via human waste, improper disposal and veterinary applications is recognized as the principal sources of pharmaceuticals ending up in various compartments of the environment. Heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) has proven to be a promising treatment method for the degradation of pharmaceuticals.
   Here, we review recent research concerning the application of TiO2 photocatalysis for the removal of selected pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic drug classes. These classes of pharmaceuticals were chosen based on their environmental prevalence and potential adverse effects. The highlighted conclusions from this review are that (1) TiO2 photocatalysis may play a major role in the degradation of pharmaceuticals; (2) various factors such as catalyst loading, initial concentrations, and water matrices significantly influence both the degradation rate and kinetics of degradation; (3) mineralization remains incomplete, despite complete abatement of the parent pharmaceutical due to the formation of stable by-products; (4) structures or number of intermediates formed differ due to the variation of photocatalytic experimental parameters, and (5) laboratory-scale experiments with artificial pharmaceutical solutions, in particular single compounds, are more common than pilot-scale or real wastewater samples. The main conclusion is that the use of heterogeneous photocatalysis can be considered a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Further studies are needed to optimize the operating conditions for maximum degradation of wastewater containing multiple pharmaceuticals under realistic conditions and on industrial scales.

AB Removal of two acidic pharmaceuticals, clofibric acid and diclofenac, present in sewage sludge using two kinds of anaerobic digestions was investigated. The effective isolation and purification pretreatment to extract the target compounds from the sewage sludge samples was firstly established, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify and quantify them. Under mesophilic conditions, the removal efficiencies for clofibric acid and diclofenac with the initial concentrations of 5 mu g/dm(3) were up to 95% and 97%. After thermophilic anaerobic digestion, the removal efficiency could be increased to 99.3% for clofibric acid, however, it did not increase for diclofenac. In general, anaerobic digestion could effectively remove the target compounds from the sewage sludge (all above 90%).

AB Our study details the investigation of real pharmaceutical wastewater (PhWW) treatment. A combination of the Fenton process, sand filtration, ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO) was tested. The sample of PhWW was highly polluted, containing high chemical oxygen demand (COD, 25,000 mg.L-1), total organic carbon (TOC, 4,940 mg.L-1), conductivity (kappa, 40,000 mg.L-1), and total N (4,054 mg.L-1) values. The pretreatment (Fenton, sand filter, UF) decreased the above parameters for 62%, 56%, 10%, and 88%, respectively. An additional membrane treatment was required since the values obtained in the pre-treatment were above maximum contaminant levels (MCLS). The next membrane step with the loose NF membrane (HL) COD, TOC, conductivity, and total N additionally decreased for 87%, 71%, 24%, and 32%, respectively. Tight NF (NF90, NF270) and RO (XLE) membranes were used in the final step and, according to the obtained parameters, membrane permeate streams could be discharged into the sewer without any risk to the ecosystem. Finally, and the most importantly, the combined methods of the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment resulted in high recovery of more than 90%.

AB The entry of pharmaceuticals into the water cycle from sewage treatment plants is of growing concern because environmental effects are evident at trace levels. Ozonation, UV- and UV/H2O2-treatment were tested as an additional step in waste water treatment because they have been proven to be effective in eliminating aqueous organic contaminants. The pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole as well as the personal care products galaxolide and tonalide were investigated in terms of degradation efficiency and by-product formation in consideration of toxic effects. The substances were largely removed from treatment plant effluent by ozonation, UV- and UV/H2O2-treatment. Transformation products were detected in all tested treatment processes. Accompanying analysis showed no genotoxic, cytotoxic or estrogenic potential for the investigated compounds after oxidative treatment of real waste waters. The results indicate that by-product formation from ozonation and advanced oxidation processes does not have any negative environmental impact.

AB Parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. Generally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. In this study, bacteria in STP effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. The susceptibility was in the order of Staphylococcus aureus > Bacillus sp. > Escherichia coli > Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. Interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >= 5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. The increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. This is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of Indian STPs. Paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. Thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.

AB This study deals with the ozonation of amoxicillin in real pharmaceutical wastewater and its efficacy as a pre-treatment, prior to biological degradation by a mixed culture of bacteria in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). An ozone utilization of 0.27 g/g-COD (chemical oxygen demand) lowered the pH of the wastewater to 6.6, reduced the specific ultraviolet absorption by 43% and increased the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration by 37%. The BOD:COD ratio became equal to 0.89, making the ozonated wastewater seemingly suitable for biological treatment; however, when the ozonated effluent was fed to the SBR, the reactor performance degraded, an effect which was attributed to ozonation by-products. In conclusion, ozonation might not be a suitable pre-treatment for pharmaceutical wastewater containing amoxicillin, and biotreatment with properly acclimated biomass may be a better option for treatment of such pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Iron ions have been immobilized on TiO2/HNTs with poly-o-phenylenediamine and poly-m-phenylenediamine simultaneously by ion imprinting technology. The ion imprinting photocatalysts have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-VIS DRS), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results demonstrated that there existed POPD and PMPD in photocatalysts. ICP-AES proved that there were iron ions in the samples compared to TiO2/HNTs. The photocatalytic activity of ion imprinting photocatalysts was studied by the degradation of tetracycline wastewater under visible light irradiation. The results showed that it was more conducive to polymerization of monomers at pH=3. The optimum mass ratio of OPD:MPD was 4:1, and the optimum value of iron ion was 0.01 g. The photodegradation rate of 40 mg L-1 tetracycline-simulated wastewater could reach 75.96%.

AB This review covers selected 2012 articles on the biological effects of pollutants and human physical disturbances on marine and estuarine plants, animals, ecosystems and habitats. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (bioaccumulation of contaminants, field assessment surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers) as well as pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, emerging contaminants, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on effects of oil spills and marine debris due in part to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Several topical areas reviewed in the past (ballast water and ocean acidification) were dropped this year. The focus of this review is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e.g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). Please use keyword searching of the text to locate related but distributed papers. Use this review only as a guide and please consult the original papers before citing them.

AB Behavior of the antimicrobial triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) was investigated under laboratory chlorination conditions and in a wastewater treatment plant discharging 380 million liters daily to the Delaware River, USA. Reactions of triclosan with chlorine were investigated using concentrations and exposure time typical of municipal wastewater treatment plants, i.e., 1 h contact time and average 1-2 mg/L residual chlorine. In reagent water, triclosan reacted quickly, transforming into mono-and dichlorinated species and further into dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol. However, triclosan remained stable for up to 2 h in wastewater samples chlorinated under these conditions. To confirm observed behavior under field conditions, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based analytical method capable of monitoring triclosan and its transformation products in wastewater was developed. Qualitative and quantitative wastewater characterization before and after chlorination are presented. Triclosan was present at the same concentration (P > 0.05) in pre-chlorination and post-chlorination aqueous wastewater samples (mean 368 ng/L). This finding is consistent with the non-detection of specific triclosan transformation products above sample reporting limits (30.0-100 ng/L), but contrasts markedly with detection of chlorination transformation products reported in reagent water. These data suggest the importance of influent matrix components in chlorination reactions of triclosan in contaminated wastewater under treatment plant conditions.

AB Spiramycin removal from wastewater using four nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NF270, NF90, ESNA1-K1 and ESNA1-LF2-LD) was studied. The effects of operating pressure, feed temperature, feed concentration, cation and anion ions on the permeate flux rate and spiramycin rejection were investigated. The results show that increasing operating pressure resulted in the increase of both permeate flux and spiramycin rejection. The flux rate increased almost linearly with temperature, while the spiramycin rejection decreased. The permeate flux rate declined relatively with increasing feed concentration of spiramycin for NF270 and ESNA1-LF2-LD membranes compared with NF90 and ESNA1-K membranes. The presence of cations reduced spiramycin rejection, with the strength of influence for the NF270 NF membrane following the order Mg2+>Ca2+>K+. The presence of anions also resulted in decreased spiramycin rejection, the strength of the effect following the order NO3- > Cl- > SO42- for the NF270 membrane.

AB Here, we explore the role that sorption to mineral surfaces plays in the fate of two commonly encountered effluent-derived pharmaceuticals, the anticonvulsants phenytoin and carbamazepine. Adsorption isotherms and pH-edge experiments are consistent with electrostatics governing anticonvulsant uptake on metal oxides typically found in soil and aquifer material (e.g., Si, Al, Fe, Mn, and Ti). Appreciable, albeit limited, adsorption was observed only for phenytoin, which is anionic above pH 8.3, on the iron oxides hematite and ferrihydrite. Adsorption increased substantially in the presence of cationic and anionic surfactants, species also commonly encountered in wastewater effluent. For carbamazepine, we propose the enhanced uptake results entirely from hydrophobic interactions with apolar tails of surfactant surface coatings. For phenytoin, adsorption also arises from the ability of surfactants to alter the net charge of the mineral surface and thereby further enhance favorable electrostatic interactions with its anionic form. Collectively, our results demonstrate that although pristine mineral surfaces are likely not major sinks for phenytoin and carbamazepine in the environment, their alteration with organic matter, particularly surfactants, can considerably increase their ability to retain these emerging pollutants in subsurface systems.

AB A main source of surface water pollution in Western Europe stems from combined sewer overflow. One of the few technologies available to reduce this pollution is the retention soil filter. In this research project, we evaluated the cleaning efficiency of retention soil filters measuring the concentration ratio of standard wastewater parameters and bacteria according to factors limiting efficiency, such as long dry phases or phases of long-lasting retention. Furthermore, we conducted an initial investigation on how well retention soil filters reduce certain micropollutants on large-scale plants. There was little precipitation during the 1-year sampling phase, which led to fewer samples than expected. Nevertheless, we could verify how efficiently retention soil filters clean total suspended solids. Our results show that retention soil filters are not only able to eliminate bacteria, but also to retain some of the micropollutants investigated here. As the filters were able to reduce diclofenac, bisphenol A and metoprolol by a median rate of almost 75%, we think that further investigations should be made into the reduction processes in the filter. At this point, a higher accuracy in the results could be achieved by conducting bench-scale experiments.

AB Models for predicting the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been developed to provide engineers and decision-makers with tools that they can use to improve their understanding of, and evaluate how to optimize, the removal of MPs and determine their impact on the receiving waters. This paper provides an overview of such models, and discusses the impact of regulation, engineering practice and research on model development. A review of the current status of MP models reveals that a single model cannot represent the wide range of MPs that are present in wastewaters today, and that it is important to start considering classes of MPs based on their chemical structure or ecotoxicological effect, rather than the individual molecules. This paper identifies potential future research areas that comprise (i) considering transformation products in MP removal analysis, (ii) addressing advancements in WWTP treatment technologies, (iii) making use of common approaches to data acquisition for model calibration and (iv) integrating ecotoxicological effects of MPs in receiving waters.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are considered to be a major source for the release in the aquatic environment of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Ozone has proved to be a suitable solution for polishing secondary domestic effluents. In this work, the performance of a full-scale ozonation plant was investigated in order to assess the removal efficiency of four target EDCs: nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, nonylphenol diethoxylate and bisphenol A. The studied system was the tertiary treatment stage of a municipal WWTP which receives an important industrial (textile) load. Chemical analyses showed that the considered substances occurred with a significant variability, typical of real wastewaters; based on this, ozonation performance was carefully evaluated and it appeared to be negatively affected by flow-rate increase (during rainy days, with consequent contact time reduction). Moreover, EDCs' measured removal efficiency was lower than what could be predicted based on literature data, because of the relatively high residual content of biorefractory compounds still present after biological treatment.

AB The photocatalytic, sonolytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C2NP) using heterogeneous (TiO2) was investigated in this study. Experiments were performed in slurry mode with artificial UV 125 watt medium pressure mercury lamp coupled with ultrasound (100 W, 33+3 KHz) for sonication of the slurry. The degradation of compound was studied in terms of first order kinetics. The catalyst concentration was optimized at 1.5 gL(-1), pH at 7 and oxidant concentration at 1.5 gL(-1). The results obtained were quite appreciable as 80% degradation was obtained for photocatalytic treatment in 120 minutes whereas, ultrasound imparting synergistic effect as degradation achieved 96% increase in 90 minutes during sonophotocatalysis. The degradation follows the trend sonophotocatalysis > photocatalysis > sonocatalytic > sonolysis. The results of sonophotocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical compound showed that it could be used as efficient and environmentally friendly technique for the complete degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants which will increase the chances for the reuse of wastewater.

AB This study assessed the performances of Fenton, ultraviolet/Fenton, ultrasound/Fenton and tri-hybrid process to remove COD from actual pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. This is the first data set on this type of wastewater yet assembled. Individual Fenton oxidation process shows fair COD removal efficiency (41.1%) under below optimum conditions: the mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+ of 4:1, the initial pH value of 4, Fe2+ dosage of 0.01 mol L-1. The ultraviolet/Fenton treatment showed a better COD removal efficiency than using Fenton alone which can be explained by the fact of synergetic effect. The combination of ultrasound with 60-minute Fenton oxidation provides greater COD removal efficiency, 61.1%, than that of ultrasound alone (48%) and Fenton oxidation alone (41.1%) which suggests that the combination of two individual processes can produce a synergistic effect. The tri-processes hybrid method can significantly increase the COD removal efficiency compared to that of individual and bi-process combination. Increasing UV exposure time can significantly increase the COD removal efficiency. Increasing of FeSO4 concentration the COD removal first increased at the range of 0.002-0.01 mol L-1 and then slightly decreased at higher concentrations. The highest COD removal rate, 91%, was found at the tri-hybrid process with 120 minutes ultrasound, 90-minute UV irradiation at the FeSO4 concentration of 0.01 mol L-1.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) are impacted by down-the-drain influents of anthropogenic chemicals. These chemicals are in consumer products and include the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and antimicrobial triclosan (TCS). Characterization of the distribution of TBBPA, TCS and the TBBPA product tribromobisphenol A (tri-BBPA) was determined at five stages along the treatment process of a typical Canadian MWTP facility. Overall, the TCS concentrations for both liquid (influents, primary effluents and final effluents (FEs)) and solid samples (primary and waste activated sludges) were similar to reported ranges in the literature. In contrast to TCS, both TBBPA and tri-BBPA concentrations were scarcely available in the literature. The TBBPA concentrations were within literature ranges for both influents and sludges, while the tri-BBPA sludge concentrations were markedly higher than a single available previous study. Mass balances for TCS, TBBPA and tri-BBPA indicated 7, 9 and 42%, respectively, of each chemical remaining in the FEs. The resultant annual mass loadings into the Detroit River were estimated to be 3.3 kg, 6.57 g, and 21.5 g for TCS, TBBPA and tri-BBPA, respectively.

AB The first large-scale assessment of pharmaceuticals in drinking water in the Czech Republic (CR) focused on the detection of five substances. Samples were collected from public water systems supplying 5.3 million people, 50.5% of the Czech population. In the initial survey of tap water from 92 major supply zones using mostly surface water, no pharmaceutical exceeded the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.5 ng/L). In a second survey, samples were collected from the outlet of 23 water treatment plants (WTPs) considered of high risk because they use surface waters influenced by wastewater. Ibuprofen was the most frequently found pharmaceutical (19 samples), followed by carbamazepine (12), naproxen (8), and diclofenac (3); concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 20.7 ng/L, with medians below 6 ng/L. Concentrations of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were below the LOQ. A follow-up survey included tap and outlet samples from eight of the 23 WTPs with the highest concentrations. Pharmaceuticals were quantified in only three tap water samples. Regarding risks to consumers, these results suggest that a relatively small population (<10%) in the CR is exposed to quantifiable concentrations of pharmaceuticals in tap water and that an extremely high margin of safety (several thousand-fold to several million-fold) is associated with these exposures.

AB Electrochemical degradation of gentamicin was achieved using a laboratory scale electrochemical reactor by optimizing pH, current density and treatment time. A two step statistical optimization was performed as per factorial design and center composite design (CCD). A Pareto chart was used for selecting statistically significant effects and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table indicated significant curvature. Thus adding additional experimental runs improved the model fitting through a second order model. Maximum degradation was predicted at a pH of 6.7, 70 A m(-2) and 45 min. The experimental data fitted well through a reduced quadratic model with R-2 equal to 0.945. The toxicity of degradation products as determined by disc diffusion as say employing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was found to be reduced by 55%. The degradation pathway of gentamicin was studied using mass spectral (MS) analysis. Pure gentamicin showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 478 ([M + 1](+)), and after addition of NaCl as electrolyte, the mass peak was observed at m/z 523. After 15 min of electrochemical treatment, a new peak appeared at m/z 316 due to the loss of one pyran moiety. After 45 min of electrochemical treatment, another peak appeared at m/z of 478 due to loss of two Na+ from gentamicin.

AB Experiments with the ultraviolet (UV)/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) were conducted to investigate the abatement of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant effluent. The fluence and the starting concentration of H2O2 in a bench-scale batch reactor were varied according to response surface method (RSM) to examine their influence on the treatment efficiency. It was shown that the investigated AOP is very effective for the abatement of micropollutants with conversion rates typically higher than 90%. Empirical relationships between fluence, H2O2 dosage and the resulting concentration of micropollutants were established by RSM. By this means it was shown that X-ray-contrast media had been degraded only by UV light. Nevertheless, most substances were degraded by the combination of UV irradiation and H2O2. Based on RSM an optimisation of multiple responses was conducted to find the minimal fluence and H2O2 dosage that are needed to reach an efficient abatement of micropollutants.

AB In this study, we investigated the pretreatment of a high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater by catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) process. Different experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the catalyst type, operating temperature, initial system pH, and oxygen partial pressure on the oxidation of the wastewater. Results show that the catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method have better catalytic activity compared to others. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion increased with the increase in temperature from 160 to 220 degrees C and decreased with the increase in pH. Moreover, the effect of the oxygen partial pressure on the COD conversion was significant only during the first 20 min of the reaction. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the wastewater improved greatly after CWAO, the ratio of BOD5/COD increased less than 0.1-0.75 when treated at 220 degrees C (BOD: biochemical oxygen demand).

ID GAMMA-LACTAMASE
AB A synthetic polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP - E 1201) primarily finds applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries due to its resistance and zero toxicity to organisms. After ingestion, the substance passes through the organism unchanged. Consequently, it enters the systems of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) without decomposing biologically during the waste treatment process, nor does it attach (through sorption) to particles of activated sludge to any significant extent, therefore, it passes through the system of a WWTP, which may cause the substance to accumulate in the natural environment. For this reason the paper investigates the potential to initiate aerobic biodegradation of PVP in the presence of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The following agents were selected as the initiators of the biodegradation process - co-substrates: acrylamide, N-acethylphenylalanine and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a substance with a similar structure to PVP monomer. The biodegradability of PVP in the presence of co-substrates was evaluated on the basis of biological oxygen demand (BOD) as determined via a MicroOxymax O-2/CO2/CH4 respirometer. The total substrate concentration in the suspension equaled 400 mg.dm(-3), with the ratio between PVP and the co-substrate being 1:1, while the concentration of the dry activated sludge was 500 mg.dm(-3). Even though there was no occurrence of a significant increase in the biodegradation of PVP alone in the presence of a co-substrate, acrylamide appeared to be the most effective type of co-substrate. Nevertheless, a recorded decrease in the slope of biodegradation curves over time may indicate that a process of primary decomposition was underway, which involves the production of metabolites that inhibit activated sludge microorganisms. The resulting products are not identified at this stage of experimentation.

AB This study utilized spatial analysis to identify hotspots for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs) using data from potential sources including wastewater treatment plants, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)-permitted pollution sources, septic systems, and agricultural and grazing areas. The study area is Lake Mead, to which the return of treated effluent is one of the largest water reuse practices in the USA. Based on Getis-Ord's Gi(star) statistic, clusters of pollution sources were identified based on the values of each feature and its neighboring features. Spatial analysis was applied to evaluate the impact from point and nonpoint source pollution. The results of spatial statistical analyses were used to evaluate the existing sampling locations in Las Vegas Wash. The results indicated that sampling locations with highest concentrations of EDCs/PPCPs were close to the outlets of subbasins with high susceptibility to EDCs/PPCPs, which confirms the suitability of sampling locations.

AB Removal efficiencies of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are usually evaluated from mass balance calculations using a small number of observations drawn from short sampling campaigns. Since micropollutant loads can vary greatly in both influent and effluent and reactor tanks exhibit specific hydraulic residence times, these short-term approaches are particularly prone to yield erroneous removal values. A detailed investigation of micropollutant transit times at full-scale and on how this affects mass balancing results was still lacking. The present study used hydraulic residence time distributions to scrutinize the match of influent loads to effluent loads of 10 polar micropollutants with different influent dynamics in a full-scale WWTP. Prior hydraulic modeling indicated that a load sampled over one day in the effluent is composed of influent load fractions of five preceding days. Results showed that the error of the mass balance can be reduced with increasing influent sampling duration. The approach presented leads to a more reliable estimation of the removal efficiencies of those micropollutants which can be constantly detected in influents, such as pharmaceuticals, but provides no advantage for pesticides due to their sporadic occurrence. The mismatch between sampled influent and effluent loads was identified as a major error source and an explanation was provided for the occurrence of negative mass balances regularly reported. This study indicates that the accurate determination of global removal values is only feasible in full-scale investigations with sampling durations much longer than 1 day. In any case, the uncertainty of these values needs to be reported when used in removal assessment, model selection or validation.

AB Swine wastewater represents an important pollution source of antibiotics in the environment; however, regional data about residual antibiotics in swine wastewater are very limited at present. This study investigated the concentrations of three classes of commonly used veterinary antibiotics, including five sulfonamides (SAs), three tetracyclines (TCs) and one macrolide (tiamulin, TIA), in swine wastewater collected from 21 concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) sites in Shandong Province, China. Both the liquid and solid (i.e., suspended solids) phases of swine wastewater were analyzed to determine the total concentration of each studied antibiotic. Results indicate that sulfamethazine had the highest median concentration (14.56 mu g L-1), followed by oxytetracycline (OTC, 8.05 mu g L-1) and chlortetracycline (CTC, 6.01 mu g L-1). The maximum detected concentration reached up to 2.02 mg L-1 (OTC) and the highest detection frequency was 95.1% (CTC). The median concentrations and detection frequencies of antibiotics in winter samples were generally higher than those in summer samples (except CTC). The log K-d values were in the range of 1.31-1.96 for SAs, 2.05-2.33 for TCs, and 1.54-1.58 for TIA in swine wastewater. More TCs (14-28%) preferred to partition in the solid phase than SAs (2-10%) and TIA (5-10%), indicating that the suspended solids of swine wastewater may not be ignored.

AB In the last years, hormone consumption has increased exponentially. Because of that, hormone compounds are considered emerging pollutants since several studies have determinted their presence in water influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, a quantitative method for the simultaneous determination of oestrogens (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol), androgens (testosterone), and progestogens (norgestrel and megestrol acetate) has been developed to determine these compounds in wastewater samples. Due to the very low concentrations of target compounds in the environment, a solid phase extraction procedure has been optimized and developed to extract and preconcentrate the analytes. Determination and quantification were performed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method developed presents satisfactory limits of detection (between 0.15 and 9.35 ng.L-1), good recoveries (between 73 and 90% for the most of compounds), and low relative standard deviations (under 8.4%). Samples from influents and effluents of two wastewater treatment plants of Gran Canaria (Spain) were analyzed using the proposed method, finding several hormones with concentrations ranged from 5 to 300 ng.L-1.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are sources for emerging pollutants, including organic compounds and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which then flow into aquatic systems. In this article, natural attenuation of pollutants by constructed wetland plants was investigated using lab-scale microcosm and batch sorption studies. The microcosms were operated at varying hydraulic residence times (HRTs) and contained decaying plant materials. Representative organic compounds and ENMs were simultaneously spiked into the microcosm influent, along with a conservative tracer (bromide), and then monitored in the effluent over time. It was observed that a more hydrophobic compound-natural estrogen achieved better removal than a polar organic compound - para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), which mimics the behaviour of the tracer. Batch sorption experiments showed that estrogen has higher sorption affinity than pCBA, highlighting the importance of sorption to the plant materials as a removal process for the organic contaminants in the microcosms. Wetland plants were also found a potential sorbent for ENMs. Two different ENMs (nano-silver and aqueous fullerenes) were included in this study, both of which experienced comparable removal in the microcosms. Relative to the tracer, the highest removal of ENMs and trace organics was 60% and 70%, respectively. A more than two-fold increase in HRT increased the removal efficiency of the contaminants in the range of 20-60%. The outcome of this study supports that plant materials of wetlands can play an important role in removing emerging pollutants from WWTP effluent.

AB The objective of this study has been to develop technologies that can reduce the content of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and bacteria from hospital wastewater. The results from the laboratory-and pilot-scale testings showed that efficient removal of the vast majority of APIs could be achieved by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) followed by ozone, ozone + hydrogen peroxide or powdered activated carbon (PAC). Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was significantly less effective. MBR + PAC (450 mg/l) was the most efficient technology, while the most cost-efficient technology was MBR + ozone (156 mg O-3/l applied over 20 min). With MBR an efficient removal of Escherichia coli and enterococci was measured, and no antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected in the effluent. With MBR + ozone and MBR + PAC also the measured effluent concentrations of APIs (e.g. ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole) were below available predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for the marine environment without dilution. Iodinated contrast media were also reduced significantly (80-99% for iohexol, iopromide and ioversol and 40-99% for amidotrizoateacid). A full-scale MBR treatment plant with ozone at a hospital with 900 beds is estimated to require an investment cost of (sic)1.6 mill. and an operating cost of (sic)1/m(3) of treated water.

AB An experimental study combining biological treatment with flocculation (F) and ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology was conducted, separately and in combination, seeking to increase insight into the capability of such treatment processes to remove emerging contaminants (ECs). The occurrence and removal efficiencies of 17 ECs are reported for wastewater from Mexico City. Results showed that activated sludge (AS) is the predominant process for removing acidic pharmaceutical compounds, and the use of a cationic flocculant increases the biodegradability of these compounds as well as that of 4-nonylphenol. The UF process alone showed greater removal of phenolic compounds than AS. However, the contribution of flocculation to EC removal by the UF unit was fairly limited. In general, the F + AS + UF processes yielded better results than their separate use, leading to the highest removal rates of 15 of the 17 compounds. In the case of some phenolic compounds and the phthalic acid esters, a competitive sorption process between the membrane and the sludge steps seemed to take place. Bis-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) was found to be significantly sorbed onto sludge. The F + AS + UF process operated as amembrane bioreactor (MBR) using 16 gL(-1) of suspended solids in the mixed liquor (MLSS) yielded the highest removal efficiencies for the ECs tested.

AB Several studies on waste-or drinking water treatment processes as well as on groundwater have recently shown that some pharmaceutical residues (PRs) are redox-sensitive. Hence, their (bio) degradation depends on the redox conditions prevalent in the aquifer. Groundwater, providing raw water for drinking water production, is often anoxic and aeration is a widespread treatment method applied mainly to eliminate unwanted iron and manganese from the water. As a side-effect, aeration may trigger the elimination of PRs. Within the present study the influence of aeration on the fate of a number of wastewater derived analgesics and their residues as well as several antimicrobial compounds was investigated. For this purpose, anoxic groundwater was transferred into stainless steel tanks, some of which were aerated while others were continuously kept anoxic. Results prove that the degradation of six phenazone type compounds is dependent on oxygen availability and compounds are efficiently removed under oxic conditions only. Concerning the antimicrobials, doxycycline and trimethoprim were better removed during aeration, whereas a slightly improved removal under anoxic conditions was observed for clindamycin, roxithromycin and clarithromycin. The study provides first laboratory proof of the redox-sensitivity of several organic trace pollutants. In addition, results demonstrate that aeration is an effective treatment for the elimination of a number of wastewater derived PRs.

AB Owing to its low cost, free chlorine is one of the most common disinfectants for wastewater and drinking water treatment. However, the formation of disinfection byproducts has been found to occur after free chlorine disinfection in recent decades. Antipyrine (ANT), an anti-inflammatory analgesic, has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In this work, the removal efficiency of ANT by free chlorine oxidation in ultrapure water was investigated with batch experiments. The influencing factors on the removal of ANT were explored at initial concentrations of ANT from 0.04 to 0.64 mg/L, free chlorine dosage from 0.30 to 1.31 mg/L, and pH from 1.5 to 9.0. The main degradation products were identified by solid phase extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that ANT reacted rapidly with free chlorine in ultrapure water systems and up to 90.6% removal efficiency of ANT was achieved after 25 sec (initial free chlorine 1 mg/L, ANT 0.5 mg/L, pH 7.0). Higher oxidant dosage, lower ANT initial concentration and low pH favor the ANT removal. The main degradation product in ANT chlorination was a monochlorine substitution product (4-chloro-1,2-dihydro-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one), which can be further chlorinated by free chlorine. In addition, the total organic carbon result indicated that ANT is difficult to be mineralized using chlorine.

AB The occurrence of 14 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in influents, effluents and sludge from five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in southem California was studied in winter and summer. All 14 compounds were detected in influent samples from the five WWTPs except for estrone. Paracetamol, naproxen and ibuprofen were the dominant compounds, with mean concentrations of 41.7, 35.7 and 22.3 mu g/L, respectively. The treatment removal efficiency for most compounds was more than 90% and concentrations in the effluents were relatively low. Seasonal variation of the compounds' concentration in the wastewater was significant: the total concentration of each compound in the wastewater was higher in winter than in summer, which is attributed to more human consumption of pharmaceuticals during winter and faster degradation of the compounds in summer. The highest concentrations of triclosan and octylphenol were detected in sewage sludge, with mean concentrations of 1505 and 1179 ng/g, respectively. Risk quotients (RQs), expressed as the ratios of environmental concentrations and the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC), were less than unity for all the compounds except for estrone in the effluents, indicating no immediate ecological risk is expected. However, RQs were higher than unity for 2 EDCs (estrone and octylphenol) and carbamazepine in sludge samples, indicating a significant ecotoxicological risk to human health. Therefore, appropriate treatment of sewage sludge is required before its application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Laboratory-scale batch experiments were developed to investigate the main removal routes for 6 commonly found quinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pipemidic acid, and piromidic acid), in wastewaters from a wastewater treatment plant, at mu g L-1 levels in an aerobic sludge system from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant. It was demonstrated that sorption and biotransformation were the main removal routes for the target antibiotics over other possible pathways, as volatilization or hydrolysis, under the experimental conditions. Mass balances indicated that sorption on sludge played a dominant role in the elimination of antibiotics from waters. The sorption coefficient K-d depended strongly on temperature and on the quinolone type and were higher at lower temperatures and for piperazinylic quinolones. K-d values were between 516 and 3746 L kg(-1) in the temperature range of 9-38 degrees C. Higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MISS) increased quinolone removal efficiency mainly by sorption. Quinolone biodegradation constituted a secondary pathway, and could be described by first-order kinetics with degradation-rate constants ranging from 8.0x10(-4) h(-1) to 1.4x10(-2) h(-1) within the same temperature range and MISS from 7000 to 15,000 mg L-1. Biodegradation depended on the MISS and temperature, but also on the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD). Higher biodegradation rates were observed at higher MISS and temperature, as well as at low initial COD. Ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin registered the highest biodegradation percentages (52.8% and 47.2%, respectively, at 38 degrees C and 15,000 mg L-1 MLSS), which is evidence that, despite the known persistence of this group of antibiotics and removal from waters mainly by sorption, it was possible to improve their removal by biodegradation, with an appropriate selection of conditions and control of process variables, as a preliminary step towards the elimination of these antibiotics from the environment. Further research is needed on the possibilities of removing sorbed antibiotics from sludge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A fast and sensitive LC-MS/MS method suitable to monitor a set of 24 pharmaceuticals belonging to 9 therapeutical families was developed using an analytical column of reduced dimensions and an appropriate SPE procedure for acidic, basic and neutral analytes. Furthermore, a preliminary assessment of the occurrence and levels of these substances in surface waters of the Leca and Douro rivers, located in the north of Portugal, was conducted. Among 17 different SPE adsorbents tested, some of them often neglected, the JTBaker H2Ophilic provided the best recoveries (average 86%). When compared to the amino and quaternary ammonium adsorbents, the 1 degrees, 2 degrees amino proved the most suitable clean-up media for surface water samples prior to enrichment by SPE. The overall method provided limits of detection generally below 5 ng L-1 and a precision below or around 10% RSD in three non-consecutive days at 500 ng L-1 and around 12% at 50 ng L-1 concentration levels. The confirmatory capabilities of the method developed are especially welcome either through the MS3 spectra or the isotopic pattern. The first known results regarding the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in Leca river confirmed its expected high contamination load and the successful selection of the target pharmaceuticals. Concentrations up to 770 ng L-1 of bezafibrate, 925 ng L-1 of paracetamol, 389 ng L-1 of hydrochlorothiazide and 283 ng L-1 of furosemide were measured. The most ubiquitous in both seasons, February and June 2009, were bisoprolol, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil. In Douro river the abundance and contamination level of pharmaceuticals was much lower which gives a clear indication that the hydraulic features of the river provide enough attenuation of the several contamination sources whereas Leca is highly impacted by insufficiently treated anthropogenic effluents.

AB Hospital wastewaters contain a large number of chemical pollutants such as disinfectants, detergents, and drug residues. A part of these pollutants is not eliminated by traditional urban waste water treatment plants, leading to a major risk for the aquatic ecosystems receiving these effluents. After having formulated a specific methodology in order to assessment ecotoxicological risk for such a situation, we applied it to the project to build a new hospital shared by several towns in the French Alps. This methodology is based on the ecotoxicological characterisation of the hospital wastewater using a battery of three chronic bioassays (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Heterocypris incongruens and Brachionus calyciflorus) and of genotoxicity tests (Ames fluctuation assay on Salmonella typhimurium, and a Fpg-modified comet assay on the trout liver cell line RTL-W1). The formulated methodology highlights a moderate risk of the hospital wastewater for the organisms of the water column of the river concerned. Nevertheless, this discharge contributes significantly to the global ecotoxicological risk when taking into account all the releases of the watershed into the river. This leads to recommending the implementation of a specific treatment system in the urban WWTP, or upstream to it, in view to protecting the aquatic organisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A study was undertaken in order to understand the kinetics and mechanism of the chemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, an insect repellent, by sulfate radical. In this experiment, sulfate radical was generated using peroxymonosulfate with iron(II) and cobalt(II) as activator. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of the sulfate radical with N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide was found to be (1.9 +/- A 0.1) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7 and a temperature of 25 A degrees C. Experiments for the chemical oxidation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in river water and secondary wastewater revealed that the percentage of the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide was slightly influenced by the water matrices. However, the selected oxidation systems are not effective for the removal of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in seawater. Transformation by-products of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide generated using peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) sulfate, peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) chloride, peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) sulfate and peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) chloride systems were identified. The results indicated that there are slight differences in the distributions of the transformation by-products detected depending on the activator. The common transformation by-products detected in all selected oxidation systems are N,N-diethylbenzamide, N-ethyl-m-toluamide, N,N-dimethyl-m-toluamide, N-ethyl-N-acetyl-m-toluamide, 2-(diethylamino)-1-m-tolylethanone, monohydroxylated N-ethyl-m-toluamide, and dihydroxylated N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. Monohydroxylated N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide were detected only when the peroxymonosulfate/iron(II) system was applied. For the peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) systems, additional isomers of monohydroxylated N-ethyl-m-toluamide were detected. Peroxymonosulfate/cobalt(II) also transformed 2-(diethylamino)-1-m-tolylethanone into N-ethyl-N-(2-oxo-2-m-tolylethyl)acetamide and monohydroxylated 2-(ethyl(vinyl)amino)-1-m-tolylethanone as transformation by-products.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive summary on modelling of micro-pollutants' (MPs) fate and transport in wastewater. It indicates the motivations of MP modelling and summarises and illustrates the current status. Finally, some recommendations are provided to improve and diffuse the use of such models. In brief, we conclude that, in order to predict the contaminant removal in centralised treatment works, considering the dramatic improvement in monitoring and detecting MPs in wastewater, more mechanistic approaches should be used to complement conventional, heuristic and other fate models. This is crucial, as regional risk assessments and model-based evaluations of pollution discharge from urban areas can potentially be used by decision makers to evaluate effluent quality regulation, and assess upgrading requirements, in the future.

AB Pharmaceuticals are normally barely removed by conventional wastewater treatments. Advanced technologies as a post-treatment, could prevent these pollutants reaching the environment and could be included in a centralized treatment plant or, alternatively, at the primary point source, e.g. hospitals. In this study, the environmental impacts of different options, as a function of several advanced treatments as well as the centralized/decentralized implementation options, have been evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. In previous publications, the characterization of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals within LCA suffers from high uncertainties. In our study, LCA was therefore only used to quantify the generated impacts (electricity, chemicals, etc.) of different treatment scenarios. These impacts are then weighted by the average removal rate of pharmaceuticals using a new Eco-efficiency Indicator EFI. This new way of comparing the scenarios shows significant advantages of upgrading a centralized plant with ozonation as the post-treatment. The decentralized treatment option reveals no significant improvement on the avoided environmental impact, due to the comparatively small pollutant load coming from the hospital and the uncertainties in the average removal of the decentralized scenarios. When comparing the post-treatment technologies, UV radiation has a lower performance than both ozonation and activated carbon adsorption.

AB This study aimed at assessing the influence of primary treatment (hydrolytic upflow sludge blanket (HUSB) reactor vs. conventional settling) and operational strategy (alternation of saturated/unsaturated phases vs. permanently saturated) on the removal of various emerging organic contaminants (i.e. ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen, tonalide, oxybenzone, bisphenol A) in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands. For that purpose, a continuous injection experiment was carried out in an experimental treatment plant for 26 days. The plant had 3 treatment lines: a control line (settler-wetland permanently saturated), a batch line (settler-wetland operated with saturate/unsaturated phases) and an anaerobic line (HUSB reactor-wetland permanently saturated). In each line, wetlands had a surface area of 2.95 m(2), a water depth of 25 cm and a granular medium D-60 = 7.3 mm, and were planted with common reed. During the study period the wetlands were operated at a hydraulic and organic load of 25 mm/d and about 4.7 g BOD/m(2)d, respectively. The injection experiment delivered very robust results that show how the occurrence of higher redox potentials within the wetland bed promotes the elimination of conventional quality parameters as well as emerging microcontaminants. Overall, removal efficiencies were always greater for the batch line than for the control and anaerobic lines, and to this respect statistically significantly differences were found for ibuprofen, diclofenac, oxybenzone and bisphenol A. As an example, ibuprofen, whose major removal mechanism has been reported to be biodegradation under aerobic conditions, showed a higher removal in the batch line (85%) than in the control (63%) and anaerobic (52%) lines. Bisphenol A showed also a great dependence on the redox status of the wetlands, finding an 89% removal rate for the batch line, as opposed to the control and anaerobic lines (79 and 65%, respectively). Furthermore, diclofenac showed a greater removal under a higher redox status (70, 48 and 32% in the batch, control and anaerobic lines). Average removal efficiencies of acetaminophen, oxybenzone and tonalide were almost >90% for the 3 treatment lines. The results of this study indicate that the efficiency of horizontal flow constructed wetland systems can be improved by using a batch operation strategy. Furthermore, we tentatively identified 4-hydroxy-diclofenac and carboxy-bisphenol A as intermediate degradation products. The higher abundance of the latter under the batch operation strategy reinforced biodegradation as a relevant bisphenol A removal pathway under higher redox conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The kinetics of photodegradation of the non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen (+)-S-2-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid, an emerging organic pollutant, was studied in aqueous solutions under deaerated and aerated conditions. The photolysis experiments were carried out under monochromatic irradiation (lambda = 254 nm) at pH = 7.0 and T = 25 degrees C.
   Simplified reaction schemes of photodegradation of naproxen are proposed in absence and in presence of oxygen respectively. The schemes take into account the photolysis of naproxen and its photoproducts and the reactions of the measured species with oxygen dissolved in the liquid bulk. According to these schemes, two kinetic models were developed which correlate the experimental data, for runs performed in absence and in presence of oxygen, with a fair accuracy and allowed to estimate the best values for the unknown kinetic parameters.
   The calculated quantum yield of direct photolysis of naproxen under deaerated media is in good agreement with the one previously reported. Under aerated conditions, the generation of singlet oxygen has also been taken into account.
   The obtained results, under the adopted conditions, indicated a marked influence of dissolved oxygen on the photodegradation rates of naproxen and the relative distribution of the major reaction intermediates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence, behavior, and release of five acidic pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), ketoprofen (KEP), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA), have been investigated along the different units in a tertiary-level domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in hyper-urbanization city of China (Shanghai). IBP was the most abundant chemicals among the measured in raw wastewater. The loads of the acidic pharmaceuticals in the WWTP influent ranged from 7.5 to 414 mg/day/1,000 inh, which were lower than those reported in the developed countries suggesting a less per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals in Shanghai. IBP obtained by highest removal (87 %); NPX and KEP were also significantly removed (69-76 %). However, DFC and CA were only moderately removed by 37-53 %, respectively. Biodegradation seemed to play a key role in the elimination of the studied pharmaceuticals except for DFC and CA. An annual release of acidic pharmaceuticals was estimated at 1,499 and 61.7 kg/year through wastewater and sludge, respectively, from Shanghai. Highest pharmaceuticals concentrations were detected in the effluent discharge point of the WWTP, indicating that WWTP effluent is the main source of the acidic pharmaceuticals to its receiving river. Preliminary results indicated that only DFC in river had a high risk to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the joint toxicity effects of these chemicals are needed to further investigate.

AB A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river. Water Environ. Res., 85, 13 (2013).

AB Ketoprofen residues have been found in surface water where they present a potential risk to nontarget aquatic species. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of ketoprofen in surface waters on fish under experimental conditions. Subchronic toxic effects on 300 embryos and larvae of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were investigated during a 30 day toxicity test with concentrations of ketoprofen: 0.003, 2.1, 6.3 and 21 mg/l. The exposure to ketoprofen showed no effect on mortality, but we observed significant delay (P < 0.05) in hatching in day 3 in fish exposed to all concentrations of ketoprofen. Significant delays (P < 0.05) in development were revealed at 2.1, 6.3 and 21 mg/l ketoprofen. On the basis of weight and growth rate evaluation and the determination of developmental stages, the lowest observed effect concentration was 0.003 mg/l. According to these results, the reported environmental concentration of ketoprofen in Czech rivers could have a negative effect on the growth and development of carp embryos and larvae. These tests have not yet been performed. Further research and search for a mechanism to reduce the incidence of ketoprofen in the waters by better wastewater treatment is required.

AB We have previously reported very high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the effluent from a treatment plant receiving wastewater from about 90 bulk drug manufacturers near Hyderabad, India. The main objective of the present study was to examine how high dilutions of this effluent affect mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 family genes and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in exposed wildlife, using the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. In gill filaments exposed to diluted effluent ex vivo, EROD activity was strongly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. In a subsequent in vivo study, groups of fish were exposed (24 h) to three concentrations of effluent, 0.8%, 1.6% or 3.2%. In this experiment, EROD in gills was induced 27-, 52- or 60-fold, respectively. Accordingly, CYP1A mRNA was markedly up-regulated in gill, liver and brain of fish exposed to all three effluent concentrations. Expression of mRNA for CYP1B1 and CYP1C1 was induced in gills at all concentrations while effects on these genes in liver and brain were weak or absent. The results of a time course study suggested that most CYP1-inducing substances in the effluent were readily metabolised or excreted, because the induced EROD activity and mRNA expression decreased when the fish were transferred to clean water. Considering that CYP1 enzymes play important roles in biotransformation of endogenous and foreign compounds, the observed dual effect of the effluent on CYP1 catalytic activity and mRNA expression suggests that multiple physiological functions could be affected in exposed wildlife.

AB The presence of acid pharmaceuticals in water environments poses a potential threat to ecosystems and human health. Recent research has shown that photo oxidation processes are much more effective for removing these pharmaceuticals. However, the existence of humic acid (HA) could inhibit the clearance efficiency of this process. In this study, we investigated the photochemical degradation of six selected acid pharmaceuticals in surface water and effluent from wastewater treatment plants using the UV/H2O2 process. The results showed that HA can act as a photo sensitizer or a .OH sink, and its concentration had a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of acid pharmaceuticals. Most of these pharmaceuticals were inhibited during this process when HA was added to deionized water solutions. In addition, the effects of chloride, bicarbonate, and nitrate on the degradation of these pharmaceuticals were different. The removal efficiency of these acid pharmaceuticals is lower in natural samples than in deionized samples because of the complex constituents in the latter.

AB Compounds from the group of cationic surfactants are widely applied in household, industrial, cleaning, disinfectant, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products as their specific properties (antimicrobial, emulsifying, anticorrosion, softening). After use, cationic surfactants are disposed to wastewater-treatment plants and finally with effluent water to surface waters due to their incomplete degradation. Moreover, they can freely circulate in different environmental compartments including living organisms. It becomes indispensable to recognize in more detail behavior, fate and biological effects of cationic surfactants. This analytical problem can be solved with use sensitive and reliable analytical techniques at sample preparation step and final determination step. In recent years, during isolation analytes from environmental samples mainly were used liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) - liquid matrices or solid-liquid extraction (SLE) - solid matrices. This technique involves application of toxic solvents (chloroform), is time-consuming and interferences are co-extracted. Nowadays, in scientific centers are carried out research to replace this traditional technique. So far, the following techniques were applied: solid-phase extraction (SPE) or it modification (HF-LPME) - liquid samples; accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) - solid samples. During the determination of total content of cationic surface active agents in environmental samples were used a traditional spectrophotometry technique and potentiometric titration technique. But those techniques are susceptible of interferences on analysis results (anionic and non-ionic compounds). The chromatographic technique (liquid chromatography) applied at the final determination step gives possibility to determine individual cationic surfactants in solvent extracts of environmental samples. The LC systems coupled with mass spectrometers are most powerful tools during such analysis.

AB Surface active agents (SAA) with negative charge of polar group are named as anionic compounds. They are the main constituent of most products containing synthetic surfactants. The linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkyl ethoxysulfates (AES) and alkyl sulfates (AS) are typically applied from this class of compounds. Those surfactants are ingredients of household detergents and cleaners, laundry detergents, cosmetic etc. Moreover they can be applied in the paper, textile and tanning industry as optical brighteners, dispersant, wetting and suspending agents. They can be substrates in the formulation of different products like dyes, pigments, pesticides, exchange resins, plasticizers and pharmaceuticals. Anionic surfactants after use are passed into sewage-treatment plants, where they are partially degraded and adsorbed to sewage sludge (applied in agriculture fields). Finally, the anionic SAA or their degradation products are discharged into surface waters and onto bottom sediments, soils or living organisms. Therefore, it is important (widely application, bioaccumulation, toxicity for living organisms) to investigate the environmental fate of those class of compounds in more details. This research involves determination the concentration of anionic surfactants with use appropriated analytical techniques in environmental samples The official methodology for determination of anionic SAA in liquid samples is based on the ion-pair reaction of these analytes compounds with methylene blue (MB) and an extraction with toxic solvent chloroform. During isolation step of anionic compounds from solid samples are employed Soxhlet and ultrasonic-assisted extraction techniques with use of methanol or mixture of other organic solvents as extraction medium. To overcome disadvantages of those traditional techniques were applied following techniques at sample preparation step from liquid and solid matrices: solid-phase extraction (SPE) and solid-phases microextraction (SPME); accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), respectively. For estimate total concentration of anionic analytes in extracts the spectrophotometric technique is used (as official regulation). For determination concentration of individual analytes were applied gas (derivatization step requires) and liquid chromatography mainly with mass spectrometry technique. The presence of anionic surface active agents was confirmed in various ecosystems (liquid and solid environmental samples).

AB Treatment of wastewater is often inadequate or completely lacking in Arctic regions. Wastewater contains different kinds of substances that can be harmful for the environment and human health, including residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Bioaccumulation and biomagnifications of chemicals in the food web are of concern. This can affect fishery that is a significant industry in many Arctic coastal regions. Wastewater from human settlements may also contain antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens that can cause negative impacts on human health and the environment. In the Arctic, especially, the direct release of untreated sewage may have severe consequences for the receiving environment due to low biological diversity, low ambient temperatures and consequently high vulnerability of the Arctic ecosystem to environmental contaminants.
   Bucket toilets are common in remote settlements but are also used in towns. In settlements having inadequate sanitary facilities the risk of contracting diseases, such as hepatitis A, is unacceptably high. Conventional centralized wastewater collection systems and treatment plants are a challenge to build in the Arctic and expensive to operate. Thus alternative methods are needed. Possible solutions are improved dry or low flush toilets with collection of toilet waste at the household level and subsequent centralized treatment by dry composting or anaerobic digestion. Both treatment methods facilitate co-treatment of wastewater along with other organic waste fractions and provide a by-product that is environmentally safe and easy to handle. Combining the above with decentralized greywater treatment will reduce the costs for expensive infrastructure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are ubiquitous in rivers, lakes, and at coastal waters affected by discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the presence of 17 different pharmaceuticals and six different phase I metabolites was determined in the bile of two wild fish species, bream (Abramis brama) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). The fish were caught from a lake that receives treated municipal wastewater via a small river. Prior to analyses, the bile content was enzymatically hydrolyzed to convert the glucuronide metabolites into the original pharmaceuticals or phase I metabolites. The solid phase extracts of hydrolyzates were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The anti-inflammatory drug naproxen could be detected in all the six bream and roach bile samples. Diclofenac was found in five of the bream and roach samples, while ibuprofen was detected in three bream and two roach samples. The observed bile concentrations of diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen in bream ranged from 6 to 95 ng mL(-1), 6 to 32 ng mL(-1), and 16 to 34 ng mL(-1), respectively. The corresponding values in roach samples ranged from 44 to 148 ng mL(-1), 11 to 103 ng mL(-1) and 15 to 26 ng mL(-1), respectively. None of the other studied compounds could be detected.

AB Natural estrogens, such as 17 beta-estradiol (E2), are the main substances responsible for estrogenic activity found in domestic sewage. In the work described herein, the degradation of E2 has been investigated by single ozonation and catalytic ozonation in the presence of manganese ion (Mn2+) and oxalic acid. The presence of Mn2+ and oxalic acid in the ozonation processes significantly improved the E2 degradation and, hence, the reduction of estrogenic activity in aqueous solution. The addition of Mn2+ and oxalic acid produced many more hydroxyl radicals in the catalytic ozonation system than in the single ozonation system. Oxidation products formed during ozonation of E2 have been identified by means of gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), on the basis of which a possible reaction pathway for E2 degradation by ozonation is proposed. E2 was first oxidized to hydroxyl-semiquinone isomers, and these were subsequently degraded to low molecular weight compounds such as oxalic acid and malonic acid. The latter were easily oxidized by ozone to form carbon dioxide (CO2). The results demonstrate that the ozonationMn2+oxalic acid system may serve as a powerful tool for removing E2, and the addition of Mn2+ and oxalic acid is favourable for the complete removal of estrogenic activity induced by steroid estrogens in aqueous solution.

AB Although the treatment technology of sulfamethoxazole has been investigated widely, there are various issues such as the high cost, inefficiency, and secondary pollution which restricted its application. Bioflocculant, as a novel method, is proposed to improve the removal efficiency of PPCPs, which has an advantage over other methods. Bioflocculant MFX, composed by high polymer polysaccharide and protein, is the metabolism product generated and secreted by Klebsiella sp. In this paper, MFX is added to 1 mg/L sulfanilamide aqueous solution substrate, and the removal ratio is evaluated. According to literatures review, for MFX absorption of sulfanilamide, flocculant dosage, coagulant-aid dosage, pH, reaction time, and temperature are considered as influence parameters. The result shows that the optimum condition is 5 mg/L bioflocculant MFX, 0.5 mg/L coagulant aid, initial pH 5, and 1 h reaction time, and the removal efficiency could reach 67.82%. In this condition, MFX could remove 53.27% sulfamethoxazole in domestic wastewater, and the process obeys Freundlich equation. R-2 value equals 0.9641. It is inferred that hydrophobic partitioning is an important factor in determining the adsorption capacity of MFX for sulfamethoxazole solutes in water; meanwhile, some chemical reaction probably occurs.

AB The World Health Organization has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the top three threats to global health. There is concern that the use of antibiotics as growth promoting agents in livestock production contributes to the increasingly problematic development of antibiotic resistance. Many antibiotics are excreted at high rates, and the land application of animal manures represents a significant source of environmental exposure to these agents. To evaluate the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure on soil microbial populations, a series of field plots were established in 1999 that have since received annual applications of a mixture of sulfamethazine (SMZ), tylosin (TYL), and chlortetracycline (CTC). During the first 6 yr (1999-2004) soils were treated at concentrations of 0, 0.01 0.1, and 1.0 mg kg(-1) soil, in subsequent years at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg kg(-1) soil. The lower end of this concentration range is within that which would result from an annual application of manure from medicated swine. Following ten annual applications, the fate of the drugs in the soil was evaluated. Residues of SMZ and TYL, but not CTC were removed much more rapidly in soil with a history of exposure to 10 mg/kg drugs than in untreated control soil. Residues of C-14-SMZ were rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 in the historically treated soils, but not in the untreated soil. A SMZ-degrading Microbacterium sp. was isolated from the treated soil. Overall, these results indicate that soil bacteria adapt to long-term exposure to some veterinary antibiotics resulting in sharply reduced persistence. Accelerated biodegradation of antibiotics in matrices exposed to agricultural, wastewater, or pharmaceutical manufacturing effluents would attenuate environmental exposure to antibiotics, and merits investigation in the context of assessing potential risks of antibiotic resistance development in environmental matrices.

AB Pharmaceutical residues have become tightly controlled environmental contaminants in recent years, due to their increasing concentration in environmental components. This is mainly caused by their high level of production and everyday consumption. Therefore there is a need to apply new and sufficiently sensitive analytical methods, which can detect the presence of these contaminants even in very low concentrations. This study is focused on the application of a reliable analytical method for the analysis of 10 selected drug residues, mainly from the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, clofibric acid, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, caffeine, naproxen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and dicofenac), in wastewaters and surface waters. This analytical method is based on solid phase extraction, derivatization by N-methyl-N-(trimethylsily)triftuoroacetamide (MSTFA) and finally analysis by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with Time-of-Flight mass spectrometric detection (GCxGC-TOF MS). Detection limits ranged from 0.18 to 5 ng/L depending on the compound and selected matrix. The method was successfully applied for detection of the presence of selected pharmaceuticals in the Svratka River and in wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant in Brno-Modrice, Czech Republic. The concentration of pharmaceuticals varied from one to several hundreds of ng/L in surface water and from one to several tens of mu g/L in wastewater.

AB Laboratory-scale batch and soil columns experiments were conducted to investigate the attenuation of estrogens (17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) during managed aquifer recharge. The role of microbial activity in the removal of selected estrogens was evaluated by comparing the results from biotic and abiotic batch experiments. Moreover, batch experiments were carried out using the sand media prepared over different acclimation periods to investigate the impact of acclimation periods on the removal of selected estrogens. Batch studies showed that adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism in the removal of 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were attenuated by 99% and 96%, respectively, in batch experiments under oxic conditions. Redox conditions did not show any significant effect on the attenuation of 17 beta-estradiol. However, the net estrogenicity of 17 beta-estradiol remaining was lower under oxic conditions (130 ng estradiol-equivalents/L) than anoxic conditions (970 ng estradiol-equivalents/L). Column studies operated at 17 h of empty bed contact time also demonstrated that removal mechanism of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol was more dependent on adsorption than biodegradation.

AB Toxic organic compounds, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, explosives, chlorine disinfection byproducts, petroleum hydrocarbons, and chlorinated solvents have found their way to wetlands from diverse sources, including agricultural and urban runoff, domestic wastewater effluent, and industrial discharges. Evaluations of the fate and ecological effects of these compounds in wetlands depends on accurate and precise methods to determine the concentrations in each of the wetland compartments, including surface water, pore water, soils, and sediments. This can be particularly challenging due to water saturation, low redox conditions, accumulation of organic matter, and reduced S compounds in wetlands, which can complicate and interfere with many of the analytical steps. The goal of this chapter is to summarize and briefly describe the methods that have been used to collect, preserve, extract, analyze, and calculate the concentrations of a multitude of volatile organic compounds and semivolatile organic compounds in the surface water, pore water, and soils and sediments of wetlands.

AB Local consumption data of pharmaceuticals were used to study the emission to wastewater and surface waters in two small Dutch water catchments. For nine high consumption pharmaceuticals: metformin, metoprolol, sotalol, losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac and carbamazepine, predicted emissions were compared to wastewater concentrations, removal in sewage treatment plants and recovery in regional surface water. The study shows that local consumption data can be very useful to select pharmaceuticals for monitoring and to predict wastewater concentrations. Measured influent concentrations were on average 78% with a range of 31-138% of predicted influent concentrations. Metformin is the pharmaceutical with the highest concentration in wastewater (64-98 mu g/L) but it is removed with >98% in sewage treatment plants (STP). Guanylurea, a biodegradation product of metformin, was detected in SIP effluents and surface waters at concentrations of 39-56 mu g/L and 1.8-3.9 mu g/L, respectively. The STP removal of the different pharmaceuticals varied strongly. For carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide and sotalol a significant better removal was found at higher temperatures and longer hydraulic retention times while for metoprolol significantly better removal was only observed at higher temperatures. Predicting environmental concentrations from regional consumption data might be an alternative to monitoring of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and surface waters.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is monitored under the USEPA High Production Volume (HPV) chemical program and is predominantly used as the active ingredient in select antibacterial bar soaps and other personal care products. The compound commonly occurs at parts-per-million concentrations in processed wastewater treatment residuals (i.e. biosolids), which are frequently land-applied as fertilizers and soil conditioners. Human and ecological risk assessment parameters measured by the authors in previous studies were integrated with existing data to perform a two-tiered human health and ecological risk assessment of land-applied biosolids-borne TCC. The 14 exposure pathways identified in the Part 503 Biosolids Rule were expanded, and conservative screening-level hazard quotients (HQ values) were first calculated to estimate risk to humans and a variety of terrestrial and aquatic organisms (Tier 1). The majority of biosolids-borne TCC exposure pathways resulted in no screening-level HQ values indicative of significant risks to exposed organisms (including humans), even under worst-case land application scenarios. The two pathways for which the conservative screening-level HQ values exceeded one (i.e. Pathway 10: biosolids -> soil -> soil organism -> predator, and Pathway 16: biosolids -> soil -> surface water -> aquatic organism) were then reexamined using modified parameters and scenarios (Tier 2). Adjusted HQ values remained greater than one for Exposure Pathway 10, with the exception of the final adjusted HQ values under a one-time 5 Mg ha(-1)(agronomic) biosolids loading rate scenario for the American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Results were used to prioritize recommendations for future biosolids-borne TCC research, which include additional measurements of toxicological effects and TCC concentrations in environmental matrices at the field level.

AB An assessment of the concentrations of thirteen different therapeutic pharmaceutical compounds was conducted on water samples obtained from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using solid phase extraction and high-and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS and UHPLC-MS/MS), was carried out.
   The target compounds included ketoprofen and naproxen (anti-inflammatories), bezafibrate (lipid-regulating), carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), metamizole (analgesic), atenolol (beta-blocker), paraxanthine (stimulant), fluoxetine (antidepressant), and levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin (fluoroquinolone antibiotics). The relative standard deviations obtained in method were below 11%, while the detection and quantification limits were in the range of 0.3 -97.4 ng.L-1 and 1.1 -324.7 ng.L-1, respectively. The water samples were collected from two different WWTPs located on the island of Gran Canaria in Spain over a period of one year. The first WWTP (denoted as WWTP1) used conventional activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater, while the other plant (WWTP2) employed a membrane bioreactor system for wastewater treatment.
   Most of the pharmaceutical compounds detected in this study during the sampling periods were found to have concentrations ranging between 0.02 and 34.81 mu.L-1.

AB Cephalosporins type antibiotics are widely used to treat infectious diseases. Their determination is not only important in blood/serum of patients under treatment but also in diverse matrices like wastewaters, milk etc. as contaminant. Keeping in view the need, a new high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of three cephalosporins (cefradine, cefuroxime and cefotaxime) has been developed. Separation was performed on an ODS column with binary solvent elution of aqueous formic acid (0.05%) and methanol in the ratio of 45: 55 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1) and UV detection at 260 nm. Under optimised conditions, all three cephalosporins were baseline separated within 5 min. Linear responses for cefradine 5-20 mu g mL(-1), cefuroxime 0.5-15 mu g mL(-1) and cefotaxime 1.0-20 mu g mL(-1) were established. LOD of 0.05-0.25 mu g mL(-1) after preconcentration was achieved. The method was applied to serum samples of patients under treatment with these antibiotics and to screen the selected cephalosporins from hospital wastewater and milk samples. Moreover, method was applied to study stability of aqueous solutions and acid/base induced degradation of all three drugs.

AB Adsorption of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using sludge-derived biochar made of various wastewater sludges was investigated. The sludge-derived biochar had relatively large Brunauer-Emmet-Teller specific surface areas that were beyond 110.0 m(2)g(-1) except the biochar made from the sludge collected from traditional sludge drying bed. The mesopore capacity was more than 57 % of the total pore capacity of all sludge-derived biochar except that made from the sludge dried through traditional sludge drying bed technique. High adsorption capacity of sludge-derived biochar was observed with a highest adsorption capacity of 19.80 +/- 0.40 mgg(-1). High correlation between the adsorption capacity of sludge-derived biochar and the volatile content in the sludge source was observed. The Freundlich model (r(2) values were in the range of 0.961-0.998) yielded the best fit with the experimental data of all the produced biochar. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were readily adsorbed onto sludge-derived biochar. These findings suggest a new approach for the pollution control of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using low-cost sludge-derived biochar.

AB Desorption from soil clay components may affect the transport and fate of antibiotics in the environment. In this study, ciprofloxacin (CIP) desorption from a kaolinite and a montmorillonite was investigated under different pHs, different concentrations of metal cations of various valencies (Na+, Ca2+ and Al3+) and a cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA), and different desorption cycles. Desorption of CIP from kaolinite and montmorillonite was strongly pH-dependent and desorption isotherms were well fitted with the Langmuir equation. The percentage of CIP desorbed increased with increasing initial CIP loadings, desorbing cation concentrations, and desorption cycles. Comparatively, CIP was more readily desorbed from kaolinite than from montmorillonite. Moreover, the hysteresis index values were all negative, suggesting that the presence of metal cations and HDTMA in solution promoted CIP desorption from clay minerals, owing to cation exchange. The XRD analyses indicated that desorption of CIP occurred from both external and interlayer surfaces of montmorillonite. Formation of Al-CIP complex on solid surface and then detachment of Al-CIP from the solid surface may contribute to the higher CIP desorption by Al3+ in comparison to Na+ and Ca2+.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are two commonly used personal care products. They may enter into aquatic environments after consumption and pose potential risks to aquatic organisms. We investigated the occurrence and fate of TCS and TCC in five large rivers (the Liao River, Hai River, Yellow River, Zhujiang River and Dongjiang River) in China, and compared the monitoring data with the predicted results from Level III fugacity modeling. TCS and TCC were detected in the five large rivers with the detection frequencies of 100% or close to 100% in surface water and sediments of almost every river. TCS and TCC were found at concentrations of up to 478 ng/L and 338 ng/L in surface water, and up to 1329 ng/g and 2723 ng/g in sediments. Cluster analysis indicated that the sites with higher concentrations were usually located in or near urban area. Meanwhile, principal component analysis also suggested that the mass inventories of TCS and TCC in water and sediment were significantly influenced by the factors such as the total or untreated urban domestic sewage discharge at river basin scale. The concentrations and mass inventories from the fugacity modeling were found at the same order of magnitude with the measured values, suggesting that the fugacity modeling can provide a useful tool for evaluating the fate of TCS and TCC in riverine environments. Both monitoring and modeling results indicated that the majority of mass inventories of TCS and TCC were stored into sediment, which could be a potential pollution source for river water. The wide presence of TCS and TCC in these large rivers of China implies that better controlling of urban domestic sewage discharge is needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Suitability of temperature, hydraulic heads, and acesulfame to quantify

AB Groundwater and surface water are in many cases closely linked components of the water cycle with respect to both quantity and quality. Bank filtrates may eventually be impacted by the infiltration of wastewater-derived micropollutants from surface waters. Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame have recently been reported as a novel class of potentially valuable tracers to study the fate of wastewater-derived substances in groundwater and, in particular, to determine the (bio)degradability of micropollutants. In this paper, a model-based analysis of a field experiment within the hyporheic and riparian zone of a highly polluted German stream was performed to assess the physical and chemical behavior of the artificial sweetener acesulfame. In the first part of this study, a reliable flow and transport model was established by jointly using hydraulic heads, temperatures, and acesulfame concentrations as inverse model calibration constraints. The analysis confirmed the conservative behavior of acesulfame and, therefore, its usability as an indicator of sewage flux provenance. However, a comparison of the appropriateness of hydraulic head, temperature, and acesulfame concentrations revealed that the characterization of the surface water-groundwater flux data indicated diurnal temperature fluctuations are the best indicator in terms of characterizing the flow and transport behavior in the groundwater system.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have drawn popular concerns recently as an emerging class of aquatic contaminants. In this study, adsorption and degradation of four selected PPCPs, metronidazole, tinidazole, caffeine and chloramphenicol, have been investigated in the laboratory using two agricultural soils in China and sediment from Changjiang River. Adsorption tests using a batch equilibrium method demonstrated that adsorption of all tested chemicals in soils could be well described with Freundlich equation, and their adsorption affinity on soil followed the order of chloramphenicol > caffeine > tinidazole > metronidazole. Generally, higher K-f value was associated with soils which had higher organic matter contents (except for caffeine acid in this study). Degradation of selected PPCPs in soils generally followed first-order exponential decay kinetics, and half-lives ranging from 0.97 to 10.21 d. Sterilization generally decreased the degradation rates, indicating that microbial activity played a significant role in the degradation in soils. The degradation rate constant decreased with increasing initial chemical concentrations in soil, implying that the microbial activity was inhibited with high chemical loading levels.

AB Application ofmesoporous C- and C,N-codoped TiO2 in the removal of diclofenac from water was studied. The sol-gelmethod was used for the preparation of the photocatalysts. The physicochemical properties of studied materials were characterized by BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. XPS confirmed the incorporation of nitrogen and carbon atoms into TiO2 lattice. The synthesized catalysts were effective in the removal of the studied pollutant from water and enabled reduction of the COD (chemical oxygen demand) value of the wastewater by at least 60%. The process of diclofenac photooxidation over the C, N-codoped and C-doped TiO2 photocatalysts proceeded similarly and was followed by pseudo-first order kinetics. The increase in calcination temperature resulted in the rutile fraction (5%) slightly lowering the effectiveness of treatment. The results over pure anatase structures confirmed that anatase has usually a better photocatalytic activity than rutile. The best changes in the water quality were observed during the first 50 min of treatment, but mineralization of pollutant did not lead to complete.

AB Emerging micropollutants have been recently the target of interest for their potential harmful effects in the environment and their resistance to conventional water treatments. Catalytic ozonation is an advanced oxidation process consisting of the formation of highly reactive radicals from the decomposition of ozone promoted by a catalyst. Nanocarbon materials have been shown to be effective catalysts for this process, either in powder form or grown on the surface of a monolithic structure. In this work, carbon nanofibers grown on the surface of a cordierite honeycomb monolith are tested as catalyst for the ozonation of five selected micropollutants: atrazine (ATZ), bezafibrate, erythromycin, metolachlor, and nonylphenol. The process is tested both in laboratorial and real conditions. Later on, ATZ was selected as a target pollutant to further investigate the role of the catalytic material. It is shown that the inclusion of a catalyst improves the mineralization degree compared to single ozonation.

AB In this study, the photo-ozonation reaction for carbamazepine (CBZ) removal was investigated under alkaline conditions. Response surface methodology based on a central composite design was used to obtain the optimum experimental conditions, and examine both main and interaction effects of the photo-ozonation reaction variables such as O-3 concentration, H2O2 concentration and UV intensity. The level of O-3 concentration significantly influenced CBZ removal (p < 0.001). CBZ removal increased with increasing both O-3 and H2O2 concentration up to a certain level, whereas further increase in O-3 and H2O2 concentration resulted in an adverse effect due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect. The optimum conditions for complete CBZ removal at pH 9 were found to be 0.89 mg of O-3 l(-1), 4.85 mg of H2O2 l(-1) and 3.18 mW of UV intensity cm(-2), respectively.

AB A screening of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other organic contaminants in sludge from seven Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) was performed in this study. This extensive screening provides information on mass flows of 282 compounds used in the Swedish society to sewage sludge. It reveals constant relative contaminant concentrations (ng mg kg(-1) d.w.), except for some pesticides and perfluorinated compounds, indicating that these originate from broad usage and diffuse dispersion rather than (industrial) point sources. There was a five order of magnitude difference in the sum concentrations of the most and least abundant species (metals and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans, respectively). Lower total concentrations were found in sludge from STPs processing primarily food industry or household sewage. Proportions of the amounts used (in Sweden) found in sludge were lower for compounds that are present in consumer goods or are diffusely dispersed into the environment (0.01-1% recovered in sludge) than for compounds used as detergents or PPCPs (17-63%). In some cases, the recovery seemed to be affected by evaporation (e.g. octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) or biotransformation (e.g. adipates) losses, while polychlorinated alkanes and brominated diphenyl ethers were recovered to disproportionately high degree (ca. 4%); likely due to incomplete statistics for imported goods.

AB Chemical degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) amitriptyline hydrochloride, methyl salicylate, and 2-phenoxyethanol by means of several advanced oxidation processes, including 254 nm UV radiation and Fenton's reagent, has been studied in different water matrixes, such as ultrapure (UP) and surface waters and two secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants. The influence of the operating variables on the elimination of these compounds in UP water was established, and kinetic parameters for their degradation, such as quantum yields along a pH range of 3-11 and second-order rate constants for their oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, were determined. Specifically, for the reactions of oxidation of the three PPCPs with hydroxyl radicals, the use of a competition kinetic model in Fenton's reagent experiments allowed evaluation of their rate constants, whose values were (10.3 +/- 0.3) X 10(9) M-1.s(-1) for amitriptyline hydrochloride, (7.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(9)M(-1).s(-1) for methyl salicylate, and (4.3 +/- 0.1) X 10(9) M-1.s(-1) for 2-phenoxyethanol. Furthermore, the simultaneous oxidation of these selected PPCPs in three different water systems (surface water from a reservoir and two secondary effluents) was studied, and the influence of the operating conditions on the removal efficiency was established. Finally, a kinetic model was proposed for the prediction of the elimination of these compounds by UV radiation and a UV/H2O2 system in these water matrixes, with theoretical results that agreed well with the experimental ones.

AB The mobility and fate of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in natural waters, soil-water systems and wastewater are controlled in part by surface interactions with nanometer (10(-9) m) metal oxide particles. Experiments were performed by mixing solutions of ofloxacin (OFL), a common, fluoroquinolone-class human and veterinary antibiotic, with 25 nm-TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles at different pH conditions. Both sorption and degradation of OFL were observed in the drug-nanoparticle solutions with initial OFL concentrations of similar to 3 to 690 mu M. Though overall isotherm behavior is logarithmic, OFL removal from the solution can be approximated by linear removal coefficients (K-r). At pH 4. K-r = 42 +/- 8 L kg(-1), at pH 6 K-r = 1288 +/- 217 L kg(-1), and at pH 9 K-r = 26 +/- 7 L kg(-1). Rinsing of substrates at pH 4 resulted in desorption of approximately 11% of the original OFL removed from the solution by TiO2 nanoparticles. Less than 1% of the removed OFL at pH 6 was recovered by rinsing the substrate; and, at pH 9 about 39% of the OFL removed by nanoparticles during the initial mixing experiment was desorbed during rinsing.
   Mass spectral analysis of OR solutions after the removal of the solid nanoparticles yielded ions that indicate the presence of de-methylated and de-carboxylated fluoroquinolone species, resulting from the degradation of OFL at the TiO2 surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the group of pharmaceuticals that is most often found in the environment, whereas estrogenic hormones are considered to be potent endocrine disruptors. However, the fate and persistence of these compounds in the environment are still unclear. In this study we propose two approaches for determining these compounds in environmental water samples: GC-MS using time windows and operating in selected ion-monitoring mode (SIM) and, for the first time, gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The identification criteria of both methods fulfilled the requirements of Directive 2002/657/EC. The use of time windows improved the sensitivity of GC-MS measurements. In GC-MS analysis the pharmaceuticals were determined as trimethylsilyl, in GC-ECD as pentafluoropropionyl derivatives. The influence of such parameters as the type of reagent, type of solvent, reaction time, reaction temperature and microwave irradiation in a household microwave oven on the efficacy of silylation was investigated. Derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in pyridine (1:1, v/v) for 30 min in 60 degrees C was found to be optimal. Optimization of the solid phase extraction procedure (SPE) confirmed that the application of Oasis HLB cartridges, the acidification of loading samples to pH 2 and the use of methanol as eluent gave the best absolute recoveries (ARs) of the target compounds. The following ARs of all the compounds were achieved: 58.2-106.8% in influent wastewater, 77.8-103.4% in effluent wastewater and 81.2-101.9% in surface water samples. Validation of the SPE-GC-MS method enables 13 pharmaceuticals to be determined with MDLs between 3.3 and 343.6 ng/L, depending on the analytes and matrices. GC-ECD analysis enables the determination of 6 pharmaceuticals in surface water samples with MDLs between 0.7 and 5.4 ng/L The proposed methods were successfully used for analyzing selected pharmaceuticals in wastewaters and river waters in Poland.

AB This study addresses the possibility for low pressure reverse osmosis membrane (RE 2521, CSM) process to serve as an alternative to remove selected antibiotics (ampicillin and amoxicillin) from synthetic wastewater by changing operating conditions such as pH = 3, 6.5 and 10; Pressure = 9, 11 and13 (bar); antibiotic concentration = 10, 255 and 500(mg/L), and temperature = 20, 30 and 40 degrees C. The experiment was designed based on Box-benken, which is a Response Surface methodology design (RSM), using Design Expert software. The concentration of antibiotics was measured by applying a UV-spectrophotometer (Cecil), at the wavelength of 254 nm. Results showed a range of rejection percentage from 73.52% to 99.36% and 75.1% to 98.8%, for amoxicillin and ampicillin, respectively. Considering the solute rejections and the membrane porosity show that the prevailing rejection mechanism of the examined antibiotics by the membrane was the size exclusion effect. The permeate flux for both of the antibiotics was 12-18.73 L/m(2).h. Although the permeate flux and antibiotic rejection are influenced by operating pressure, pH, and temperature individually, the interaction between operating parameters did not have noticeable effects. According to the results obtained in this study, the application of RO membrane is recommended for the selected antibiotics to be removed to a considerable degree (up to 95%).

AB Time-dependent dynamics in the concentrations of four anti-influenza drugs (oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and amantadine) in environmental waters collected from the Yodo River basin, Japan, were monitored for the first time over a 1 year period (July 2010 to June 2011). The clear, convex dynamic profiles of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, and zanamivir during a 3 month seasonal influenza outbreak (January to March 2011) were synchronized well with that of the numbers of influenza patients treated with the drugs. The highest levels in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and river waters were, respectively, 177 and 60 ng/L (oseltamivir), 827 and 288 ng/L (oseltamivir carboxylate), and 30 and 15 ng/L (zanamivir). Fixed levels of amantadine were detectable year-round (100-200 ng/L in the STPs and 10-30 ng/L in river waters). The predicted convex profiles of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, and zanamivir in both STPs and river waters were significantly correlated (0.714 < R < 0.932) with the observed values. The profiles were predicted successfully by simple mathematical principles, taking the number of influenza patients, quantities of Tamiflu and Relenza used, dilution by drainwaters passing through STPs, removal rates at STPs, dilution rates in river effluents, and attenuation rates in rivers into consideration.

AB The occurrence of 73 representative pharmacologically active compounds (PhACs) was assessed in a sewage-impacted section of the Llobregat River (NE Catalonia, Spain). This Mediterranean river is characterized by flow rate fluctuations strongly influenced by seasonal rainfall. River flow variations increase the potential environmental risk posed by organic micro-pollutants as their concentrations may increase substantially under low flow conditions. Little is known about the transport behavior of emerging contaminants in surface waters once they are discharged from waste water treatment plants (WWTP) into rivers. This research aimed to study the presence and fate of emerging contaminants under different hydrological conditions by sampling two different sites along the river in different seasons. The highest levels of pharmaceuticals were determined during cold and dry periods. The impact of the flow changes on the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the river was assessed with the relative sensitive coefficients. Due to expected dilution effects, the response of pharmaceuticals to river flow was negative. Only in a few cases, positive relationships between drug concentrations and flow were detected, suggesting an important role of other hydrological phenomena like sediment re-suspension as well as the source of pollutants. To evaluate the role of other factors influencing PhAC concentrations, a plug-flow model was applied to obtain disappearance constants "k" for a set of selected compounds. Erythromycin presented k values of -0.15 h(-1) in both sites being the compound more efficiently removed from the water column. The k values for ibuprofen, furosemide, enrofloxacin, enalapril, acetaminophen, diclofenac and Ketoprofen were between -0.04 and -0.10 h(-1) showing less disappearance than erythromycin in the water column. However, other compounds presented k values <0.06, which suggested conservative behavior of these compounds in the water column. This study supports the reliability of the calculated k values for the disappearance of compounds in river waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic compounds such as sterols and hormones have been detected in surface waters at ecologically relevant concentrations with sources including effluent discharged from publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) as well as leachate and runoff from land amended with municipal sludge (biosolids). Greater than 20% of regulated effluents discharged into U.S. surface waters experience in-stream dilution of <10-fold and potential impacts are particularly likely in receiving waters dominated by POTW effluents. The increasing use of biosolids on agricultural land exerts additional stress, thereby necessitating environmental monitoring for potential ecological and human health effects. Alternatively or in addition to monitoring efforts, screening for potentially hazardous chemicals can be performed using empirical models that are scalable and can deliver results rapidly. The present study makes use of data from U.S. EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) to predict the aqueous-phase concentrations and removal efficiencies of 10 sterols (campesterol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, H-stigmastanol, cholesterol, desmosterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and ergosterol) as well as the putative toxicity posed by four specific hormones based on their reported biosolids concentrations using published empirical models. Model predictions indicate that removal efficiencies for sterols are uniformly high (similar to 99%) and closely match removal rates calculated from chemical monitoring at POTWs (paired t-test; p = 0.01). Results from toxicity modeling indicate that the hormones estrone, estradiol and estriol had the highest leaching potentials amongst the compounds considered here and that 17 beta-ethinylestradiol was found to pose a potentially significant threat to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) via run-off or leaching from biosolids-amended fields. This study exemplifies the use of in silico analysis to (i) identify potentially problematic organic compounds in biosolids, (ii) predict influent and effluent levels for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) of emerging concern, and (iii) provide initial estimates of runoff concentrations, in this case for four prominent hormones known to act as endocrine disruptors.

AB This study investigated the global adsorption rate of tetracycline on adsorbents obtained from treatment sludge. Experimental data on tetracycline concentration decay curves were interpreted with kinetic models (first-order, second-order, Langmuir, and intraparticle diffusion) and diffusional models (pore volume diffusion model and surface diffusion model). The first-order kinetic model provided the best interpretation of tetracycline adsorption kinetics on all adsorbents, and its rate constant varied in a linear manner the macro- and mesopore volume of the adsorbents. It was also found that the tetracycline adsorption rate is controlled by intraparticle diffusion and that diffusion in the pore volume represents >80% of total intraparticle diffusion. This indicates that surface diffusion does not play a major role in tetracycline diffusion on the different adsorbents. Furthermore, the effective tetracycline diffusion coefficient in the pore volume gradually increased with greater meso- and macropore volume and larger surface area of the adsorbent, indicating that the tetracycline adsorption rate is directly related to the accessibility of this molecule to the microporous structure of the materials.

AB Zinc oxide (ZnO) was studied as a photocatalyst under artificial ultraviolet (UV) and solar irradiation for degradation of estrone, a ubiquitous micropollutant widely detected in treated effluent from sewage treatment facilities. Despite its lower specific surface area and larger agglomerate size in water, ZnO enabled significantly more rapid estrone degradation in water under artificial UVA irradiation compared to the benchmark photocatalyst, Aeroxide (R) titanium dioxide P25 (P25 TiO2). Dissolution of ZnO photocatalyst, predominantly driven by its aqueous solubility, occurred during the photocatalytic degradation process which could be mitigated by pH adjustment. Solar irradiation was found to be a highly effective UV source for estrone photocatalytic degradation using either ZnO or P25 TiO2. Previous comparative studies on ZnO and TiO2 photocatalysts were reviewed, and the origin of the superior performance of ZnO under artificial UVA irradiation was investigated. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements showed that ZnO exhibited markedly higher UV absorbance than P25 TiO2 within the wavelength range of 320-385 nm, which supports the observation that ZnO showed evidently better performance than P25 TiO2 for estrone degradation under weak artificial UVA irradiation. Furthermore, a detailed mechanism was proposed on the role of intrinsic defects during ZnO optical excitation and charge transfer process, and its potential effect on ZnO surface redox reactions. The mechanism was supported by the observation that higher levels of hydrogen peroxide were generated in UV-irradiated ZnO suspension in the absence of added electron donors, suggesting that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO may be enhanced by an effective charge separation mechanism induced by its intrinsic defects.

AB In this work, abatement of diuron (D), (selected as an example of priority pollutant) and nicotine (N), caffeine (C), ibuprofen (I) and phenacetin (P), (chosen as examples of target emerging pollutants), have been carried out by using persulfate activated by Fe2+. Reactions were accomplished at room temperature in a batch or semicontinuous (SC) manner, using 5 mg/L of each pollutant.
   The effectiveness of the process was measured by attending at the pollutant conversion and TOC removal. Kinetic model for both reaction rates - pollutants oxidation and mineralization - was developed - on the basis of a radicalic mechanism and kinetic parameters calculated. Moreover, the kinetic model discriminated was successfully validated by comparison of predicted and experimental values obtained for pollutant and TOC conversion when mixtures of pollutants were treated at different persulfate and iron concentrations. Iron addition process presented a remarkable effect on oxidation results. It was found that a continuous slow release of Fe2+ notably increased the efficiency of the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The biosorption potential of three fungal waste-biomasses (Acremonium strictum, Acremonium sp. and Penicillium sp.) from pharmaceutical companies was compared with that of a selected biomass (Cunninghamella elegans), already proven to be very effective in dye biosorption. Among the waste-biomasses, A. strictum was the most efficient (decolorization percentage up to 90% within 30 min) with regard to three simulated dye baths; nevertheless it was less active than C. elegans which was able to produce a quick and substantial decolorization of all the simulated dye baths (up to 97% within 30 min). The biomasses of A. strictum and C. elegans were then tested for the treatment of nine real exhausted dye baths. A. strictum was effective at acidic or neutral pH, whereas C. elegans confirmed its high efficiency and versatility towards exhausted dye baths characterised by different classes of dyes (acid, disperse, vat, reactive) and variation in pH and ionic strength. Finally, the effect of pH on the biosorption process was evaluated to provide a realistic estimation of the validity of the laboratory results in an industrial setting. The C. elegans biomass was highly effective from pH 3 to pH 11 (for amounts of adsorbed dye up to 1054 and 667 mg of dye g(-1) biomass dry weight, respectively); thus, this biomass can be considered an excellent and exceptionally versatile biosorbent material.

AB The performance of ozonation in wastewater depends on water quality and the ability to form hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) to meet disinfection or contaminant transformation objectives. Since there are no on-line methods to assess ozone and center dot OH exposure in wastewater, many agencies are now embracing indicator frameworks and surrogate monitoring for regulatory compliance. Two of the most promising surrogate parameters for ozone-based treatment of secondary and tertiary wastewater effluents are differential UV254 absorbance (Delta UV254) and total fluorescence (Delta TF). In the current study, empirical correlations for Delta UV254 and Delta TF were developed for the oxidation of 18 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), including 1,4-dioxane, atenolol, atrazine, bisphenol A, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), phenytoin, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, trimethoprim, and tris-(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) (R-2 = 0.50-0.83) and the inactivation of three microbial surrogates, including Escherichia coli, MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores (R-2 = 0.46-0.78). Nine wastewaters were tested in laboratory systems, and eight wastewaters were evaluated at pilot- and full-scale. A predictive model for center dot OH exposure based on Delta UV254 or Delta TF was also proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Removal of Polyvinylpyrrolidone from Wastewater Using Different Methods
SO WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH

   hydrolysis; sorption; active carbon
ID POLY(VINYLPYRROLIDONE); ADSORPTION
AB Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a frequently used polymer in the pharmaceutical and foodstuff industries. Because it is not subject to metabolic changes and is virtually nondegradable, trace concentrations of PVP are often found in community wastewaters. The literature finds that the partial removal of PVP in wastewater treatment plants probably occurs through sorption. The primary objective of this study was to find an effective method to remove PVP from wastewaters. In this regard, the literature indicates the theoretical potential to use specific enzymes (e. g., c-lactamases, amidases) to gradually degrade PVP molecules. Polyvinylpyrrolidone biodegradability tests were conducted using suitable heterogeneous cultures (activated sludge) collected from a conventional wastewater treatment plant, treatment plants connected to a pharmaceutical factory, and using select enzymes. Aerobic biodegradation of PVP in a conventional wastewater environment was ineffective, even after adaptation of activated sludge using the nearly identical monomer 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Another potential method for PVP removal involves pretreating the polymer prior to biological degradation. Based on the results (approximately 10 to 15% biodegradation), pretreatment was partially effective, realistically, it could only be applied with difficulty at wastewater treatment plants. Sorption of PVP to an active carbon sorbent (Chezacarb S), which corresponded to the Langmuir isotherm, and sorption to activated sludge, which corresponded to the Freundlich isotherm, were also evaluated. From these sorption tests, it can be concluded that the considerable adsorption of PVP to activated sludge occurred primarily at low PVP concentrations. Based on the test results, the authors recommend the following methods for PVP removal from wastewater: (1) sorption; (2) application of specific microorganisms; and (3) alkaline hydrolysis, which is the least suitable of the three for use in wastewater treatment plants.

AB The occurrence and concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were investigated in municipal effluents and in marine receiving water. Final effluent from four large publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and seawater collected near the respective POTW outfall discharges and a reference station were collected quarterly over one year and analyzed for 56 CECs. Several CECs were detected in effluents; naproxen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate were the compounds most frequently found and with the highest concentrations (>1?mu g/L). Gemfibrozil and naproxen had the highest seawater concentrations (0.0009 and 0.0007?mu g/L) and also were among the most frequently detected compounds. Effluent dilution factors ranged from >400 to approximately 1,000. Fewer CECs were detected and at lower concentrations in seawater collected from the reference station than at the outfall sites. Effluent concentrations for some CECs (e.g., pharmaceuticals) were inversely related to the degree of wastewater treatment. This trend was not found in seawater samples. Few temporal differences were observed in effluent or seawater samples. Effluent CEC concentrations were lower than those currently known for chronic toxicity thresholds. Nevertheless, the evaluation of potential chronic effects for CECs is uncertain because aquatic life toxicity thresholds have been developed for only a few CECs, and the effluent and seawater samples had compounds, such as nonylphenol, known to bioaccumulate in local fish. Additional data are needed to better understand the significance of CEC presence and concentrations in marine environments. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 26742682. (c) 2012 SETAC

AB To investigate the occurrence and bioaccumulation of organic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) near four major wastewater ocean outfalls in the Southern California Bight, more than 75 pharmaceutical and personal care products, current-use pesticides, and industrial/commercial chemicals were analyzed in sediment and liver tissues of hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) using gas and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. Although most CECs targeted were infrequently detected or not detectable, triclosan, 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) and bis(2-ethylhexylphthalate) were detected in all sediments at median (maximum) concentrations of 5.1 (8.6), 30 (380), and 121 (470) mu g/kg, respectively. In the liver, 4-NP and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners 47 and 99 were detected in >90% of samples at median (maximum) concentrations of 85 (290) and 210 (480) mu g/kg, respectively. The sedative diazepam was detected in all liver samples, but was infrequently detected in sediments. Sediment and liver concentrations across outfall locations ranged over several orders of magnitude and were elevated relative to a reference site. Relative to sediment, accumulation in liver of PBDEs 47 and 99 was comparable to that for legacy organochlorines, confirming their high bioaccumulation potential and suggesting their inclusion in future tissue monitoring studies. Mean tissue PBDE and diazepam concentrations were higher in livers from male versus female P. verticalis, suggesting that gender differences also be considered in designing such studies. Environ.

AB Municipal wastewater discharges constitute a major source of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) to coastal waters, yet uncertainty exists regarding their linkage to adverse biological effects such as endocrine disruption. Limited information is available concerning the types and fate of CECs discharged to the Southern California Bight (SCB) from municipal wastewater and their potential for ecological impacts. The present study investigated the impacts of CECs from ocean wastewater discharges on SCB fish. Concentrations of CECs were measured in effluents from four major municipal wastewater dischargers. Seawater, sediment, and hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) from the discharge sites and a reference area were collected and analyzed for chemical and biological indicators. Low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial and commercial compounds were measured in effluent. Some CECs were also detected in sediment, seawater, and fish livers near the outfalls, confirming exposure to CECs. Fish plasma hormone analyses suggested the presence of physiological effects, including a reduced stress response, altered estrogen synthesis or estrogenic exposure, and reduced thyroxine. Most fish responses were found at all sites and could not be directly associated with effluent discharges. However, concentrations of thyroxine were lower at all discharge sites relative to the reference, and estradiol concentrations were lower at three of the four outfall sites. The physiological responses found were not associated with adverse impacts on fish reproduction or populations. Interpretation of molecular and physiological measurements in field organisms such as those used in the present study is challenging because of a lack of information on baseline conditions and uncertain linkages to apical endpoints such as survival and reproduction.

AB This study presents a simple electrochemical approach for preparing a poly(l-serine) film-modified glassy carbon electrode, which responds quickly and sensitively during the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and ofloxacin in prepared, environmental, and pharmaceutical samples. The prepared electrode exhibited catalytic activities and promoted the oxidation of acetaminophen and ofloxacin. Acetaminophen and ofloxacin showed linear responses between 1.0 x 10(-5) and 1.0 x 10(-4) mol/L and their limits of detection were 1.2 x 10(-7) and 1.6 x 10(-7) mol/L, respectively. The average recoveries (+/- relative standard deviations) of acetaminophen and ofloxacin were 96.8 +/- A 3.5 % and 97.6 +/- A 3.2 %, respectively, indicating that the prepared electrode and detection method are very accurate and reproducible for the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and ofloxacin.

AB This article reports the first identification of paraben-chlorinated derivatives in river water. Parabens are widely used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Parabens can be easily chlorinated by chlorinated tap water. The resulting chlorinated derivatives might pose a higher potential risk to humans and ecosystems than the corresponding parent parabens. However, the occurrence of such derivatives in rivers remains unknown so far. We studied 23 parabens and their chlorinated derivatives from rivers receiving effluents from sewage treatment plants in Shizuoka city, in the central Pacific region of Japan. The compounds were extracted by solid-phase extraction with a styrene polymer sorbent, trimethylsilyl-derivatized, and then identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six chlorinated parabens and their primary degradation products, two chlorinated hydroxybenzoic acids, were found for the first time in river water. Moreover, in river water, chlorinated derivatives preferentially partition into the suspended-solid phase.

AB The variation and fate of four endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) composed of 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated along treatment units in a sewage treatment plant (STP), China with anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic activated sludge processes. The mean concentrations were 64.8?ng/L (E2), 115.3?ng/L (4-n-NP), 171.5?ng/L (EE2), and 920.7?ng/L (BPA) in the influents, and 22.8?ng/L (E2), 50.9?ng/L (4-n-NP), 49.9?ng/L (EE2), and 84.3?ng/L (BPA) in the effluents. The biological treatment was more effective in removing NP, BPA and E2 from the aqueous phase than the primary treatment, while the latter could effectively remove EE2. Their possible removal mechanisms during the biological treatment with activated sludge were further explored through spiked batch experiments under three oxygen-supplying conditions (anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic). The batch experiments showed that 4-n-NP, E2 and BPA were removed from the aqueous phase through biodegradation. The combination of sludge sorption and biodegradation accounted for the removal of EE2. Anoxic activated sludge showed the most rapid degradation of 4-n-NP, while E2 could be removed most effectively by aerobic activated sludge, and sludge sorption had a remarkable effect on its removal within the initial 15?min of the experiments under three oxygen-supplying conditions.

COSMO-RS model was used for the prediction of selectivity of these compounds in aqueous medium at infinite dilution. Initial benchmarking studies were done by comparing experimental logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficient values (log K-ow) with COSMO-RS predicted data on 13 poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) similar in structure to that of PCP and DDT. 1015 possible ILs were then used to determine the best extractant for the removal of these two EDCs from aqueous solution.

AB Activated carbon (AC) has been shown to remove precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts. Granular and powdered activated carbon (GAC, PAC) were investigated for their potential to adsorb N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors from blends of river water and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). At bench scale, waters were exposed to lignite or bituminous AC, either as PAC in bottle point experiments or as GAC in rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs). NDMA formation potential (FP) was used as a surrogate for precursor removal. NDMA FP was reduced by 37, 59, and 91% with 3, 8, and 75 mg/L of one PAC, respectively, with a 4-h contact time. In RSSCTs and in full-scale GAC contactors, NDMA FP removal always exceeded that of the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm. For example, whereas DOC breakthrough exceeded 90% of its influent concentration after 10 000 bed volumes of operation in an RSSCT, NDMA FP was less than 40% of influent concentration after the same bed life of the GAC. At full or pilot scale, high NDMA FP reduction ranging from >60 to >90% was achieved across GAC contactors, dependent upon the GAC bed life and/or use of a preoxidant (chlorine or ozone). In all experiments, NDMA formation was not reduced to zero, which suggests that although some precursors are strongly sorbed, others are not. This is among the first studies to show that AC is capable of adsorbing NDMA precursors, but further research is needed to better understand NDMA precursor chemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, molecular size) and evaluate how best to incorporate this finding into full-scale designs and practice.

AB A novel multi-templates molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), using acidic pharmaceuticals mixture (ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen (NPX), ketoprofen (KEP), diclofenac (DFC), and clofibric acid (CA)) as the template, was prepared for the removal of acidic pharmaceuticals from contaminated water. The sorption behaviors of the MIP including sorption kinetics, isotherms, effect of pH and ionic strength were investigated in detail. The MIP exhibited excellent selectivity affinity toward five acidic pharmaceuticals with higher binding capacity in water compared to non-imprinted polymer (NIP). The pseudo-second-order model well described the adsorption of acidic pharmaceuticals on the MIP. The feasibility of applying MIP for removing acidic pharmaceuticals from contaminated environmental water was demonstrated by comparing the adsorption capacity of acidic pharmaceuticals in spiked lake water to that in deionized water. In addition, the MIP could be used at least fifteenth cycles without obvious loss in adsorption capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and distribution of six psychoactive compounds (primidone, phenobarbital, oxazepam, diazepam, meprobamate, and pyrithyldione) and a metabolite of primidone (phenylethylmalonamide) were investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, surface water, groundwater of a bank filtration site, raw and final drinking water, and in groundwater affected by former sewage irrigation.
   Primidone and its metabolite phenylethylmalonamide were found to be ubiquitous in environmental water samples in Berlin. Maximum concentrations of 0.87 and 0.42 mu g/L, respectively, were encountered in WWTP effluents. Both compounds are apparently not removed when passaging through the different compartments of the water cycle and concentrations are only reduced by dilution. Phenobarbital was present at nearly every stage of the Berlin water cycle with the exception of raw and final drinking water. The highest concentrations of phenobarbital (up to 0.96 mu g/L) were measured in groundwater influenced by former sewage irrigation. Oxazepam was only present in WWTP effluents and surface waters (up to 0.18 mu g/L), while diazepam was not detected in any matrix. Due to their withdrawal from the German market years ago, the pharmaceuticals meprobamate and pyrithyldione were only found in sewage farm groundwater (up to 0.50 and 0.04 mu g/L, respectively) and, in case of meprobamate, also in decade old bank filtrate (0.03 mu g/L).
   Our results indicate a high persistence of some of the investigated compounds in the aquatic system. As a consequence, these pollutants may potentially reach drinking water resources via bank filtration if present in WWTP effluents and/or surface waters in partly closed water cycles such as Berlin's.

AB The potential ecological impact of disinfection by-products (DBPs) present in chlorinated wastewater effluents is not well understood. In this study, the chlorinated effluent of traditional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and advanced water reclamation plants (AWRPs) supplying highly-treated recycled water were analyzed for nitrosamines and trihalomethanes (THMs), and a battery of bioassays conducted to assess effluent toxicity. An increase in general toxicity from DBPs was revealed for all wastewaters studied using an in vitro bioluminescence assay. Examples of androgenic activity and estrogenic activity arising from DBPs at specific sampling sites were also observed. The in vivo model (Anemia franciscana) was generally not adversely affected by exposure to DBPs from any of the chlorinated wastewaters studied. The observed toxicity could not be related to the concentrations of THMs and nitrosamines present, indicating that DBPs not monitored in this study were responsible for this. This work highlights the complexity of DBPs mixtures formed in chlorinated wastewaters, illustrating that toxicity of wastewater DBPs cannot be predicted by chemical monitoring of THMs and nitrosamines. The results suggest bioassays may be particularly useful monitoring tools in assessing toxicity arising from DBPs of these complex waters. The research concludes that DBPs formed in the chlorinated wastewaters studied can be toxic and may have a deleterious impact on aquatic organisms that are exposed to them, and therefore, that chlorination or chlorination/dechlorination may not be adequate treatment strategies for the protection of receiving waters. Chlorinated wastewater toxicity (from DBPs) is not well-understood in the Australian context, and this study serves to advise regulators on this issue. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of 166 emerging compounds and four heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Hg and Pb) in treated wastewater and groundwater has been monitored at the Llobregat delta (Barcelona, Spain) over a period of 3 years. Selected compounds were pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PCPs), dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and priority substances included in the 2008/105/CE Directive. Analysis was performed in tertiary treated wastewater (TWW), after an additional treatment of ultrafiltration reverse osmosis and UV disinfection, and groundwater from a deep confined aquifer. This aquifer is artificially recharged with TWW through injection wells. After the advanced treatment, 38 pharmaceuticals, 9 PCPs, 9 pesticides and 7 PAHs still showed a frequency of detection higher than 25% in the TWW, although at low concentration levels (ng/l). Not all active compounds found in the TWW were present in groundwater, indicating possible degradation within the aquifer media after the injection. A number of chemicals. mainly 10 pesticides and 10 pharmaceuticals were only present in groundwater samples, confirming a different origin than the injected TWIN, probably agricultural activities and/or infiltration of poorly treated wastewater.

AB UV irradiation technology as a membrane bioreactor (MBR) post-treatment was investigated and assessed. Both UV low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) lamps were examined. The technology was installed in a pilot plant treating hospital wastewater to provide the study with adequate field data.
   The effect of the UV irradiation was enhanced with varying dosages of H2O2 to establish an advanced oxidation process (AOP).The efficiency of the pharmaceutical removal process was assessed by examining 14 micropollutants (antibiotics, analgesics, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, cytostatics and X-ray contrast media) which are typically released by hospitals and detected with liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   While the MBR treatment generally showed only a low degradation capacity for persistent pharmaceuticals, much better degradation was obtained by applying UV irradiation and H2O2 as AOP. The "conventional" cost-benefit analysis of the different technology options taking into account both electrical energy consumption and pharmaceutical removal efficiency, revealed clearly better performance of low pressure UV lamps as AOP. However, a holistic comparison between the different scenarios was carried out by evaluating their environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Decisive advantages were highlighted to include this approach in the decision making process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atenolol (ATL) is a photostable and hydrolysis resistant beta-blocker and has been frequently detected in natural water. In this study, mechanism on aquatic photodegradation of ATL was investigated with an emphasis on the role of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) as well as other natural water compositions (nitrate, bicarbonate and ferric ions). Significant acceleration of photodegradtion of ATL was observed in the presence of each DOMs added, namely Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA), Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA), Nordic Lake Fulvic Acid (NOFA) and Nordic Lake Humic Acid (NOHA). Hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) was determined as the main reactive species in this process, instead of singlet oxygen or excited triplet of DOM. Addition of these four DOMs all inhibited photodegradation of ATL in nitrate solutions through reducing nitrated-derived (OH)-O-center dot and screening photons absorbed by nitrate. No loss of ATL was detected in bicarbonate solution with or without DOMs. Bicarbonate exhibited a scavenger of (OH)-O-center dot derived from DOMs. However, in the presence of iron species, photodegradation of ATL was significantly enhanced by the addition of each DOM, due to the high yield of (OH)-O-center dot in the photoprocess of Fe(III)-DOM complex. The photoproducts distribution of ATL demonstrated that SRFA promote the hydroxylation on aromatic ring in the presence of nitrate and reduce the ketone moiety to alcohol in the system of ferric ions. Our findings indicate that DOMs should be considered in aquatic photoprocesses of organic pollutants induced by themselves as well as other coexisting photoactive water compositions.

AB The stability of nine illicit drugs and metabolites in influent wastewater at relevant conditions (20 C and at pH 7.5) was evaluated during 26h (in 1 h intervals) to assess whether significant in-sewer processes of degradation or formation occur. This assessment is important for the sewage epidemiology approach, which uses concentrations of illicit drugs and metabolites in influent wastewater to back-calculate amounts of these substances used by a community or population. The results of this study showed that amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy and EDDP (metabolite of methadone) are stable in wastewater for 12h and longer. For benzoylecgonine and methadone, a modest formation in the course of time was observed (0.2% per h and 0.4% per h, respectively), while for cocaine (40% degradation after 12 h), ecgonine methylester (20% degradation after 12 h), and 6-monoacetylmorphine (20% degradation after 12h), a clear decrease in concentrations in time was seen. These findings suggest that for compounds with a significant stability issue, it is important to take their behavior into account when performing back-calculations in sewage epidemiology. However, this study also highlights the need of future research regarding transformation pathways of the individual compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concentrations of eighteen perfluorinated compounds (PFCs: C5-C14 carboxylates, C4, C6-C8 and C10 sulfonates and 3 sulfonamides) were determined in wastewater and sludge samples originating from two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (dissolved phase) or sonication followed by solid phase extraction (solid phase). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by LC-MS/MS. According to the results, perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were dominant in wastewater and sludge samples from both plants. The average concentrations in the raw and treated wastewater ranged up to 75.7 ng L-1 (perfluorotridecanoic acid, PFTrDA) and 76.0 ng L-1 (PFPeA), respectively. Concentrations of most PFCs were higher in effluents than in influents, indicating their formation during wastewater treatment processes. In sewage sludge, the average concentrations ranged up to 6.7 ng g(-1) dry weight (PFOS). No significant seasonal variations in PFCs concentrations were observed, while higher concentrations of PFOA, PFOS and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were determined in the WWTP receiving municipal and industrial wastewater. Significantly different distribution coefficient (K-d) values were determined for different PFCs and different type of sludge, ranging between 169 L kg(-1) (PFHxS) to 12,922 L kg(-1) (PFDA).

AB The occurrence of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds in influent and effluent wastewater and in primary, secondary and digested sludge in one-year period has been evaluated. Solid-water partition coefficients (K-d) were calculated to evaluate the efficiency of removal of these compounds from wastewater by sorption onto sludge. The ecotoxicological risk to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, due to wastewater discharges to the receiving streams and to the application of digested sludge as fertilizer onto soils, was also evaluated. Twelve of the pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater at mean concentrations from 0.1 to 32 mu g/L All the compounds found in wastewater were also found in sewage sludge, except diclofenac, at mean concentrations from 8.1 to 2206 mu g/kg dm. Ibuprofen, salicylic acid, gemfibrozil and caffeine were the compounds at the highest concentrations. Log K-d values were between 1.17 (naproxen) and 3.48 (carbamazepine). The highest ecotoxicological risk in effluent wastewater and digested sludge is due to ibuprofen (risk quotient (RQ): 3.2 and 4.4, respectively), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (RQ: 12 and 22, respectively) and 17 beta-estradiol (RQ: 12 and 359, respectively). Ecotoxicological risk after wastewater discharge and sludge disposal is limited to the presence of 17 beta-estradiol in digested-sludge amended soil (RQ: 2.7). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB A rapid method for determination of seven parabens and two chlorinated by-products in sewage sludge was developed based on matrix solid-phase dispersion and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical procedure showed good recoveries that ranged from 80 to 125%, with relative standard deviations lower than 12% and low detection limits, ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 ng g(-1) dry weight. The developed method was applied to the analysis of sewage sludge collected during 2010 in 19 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in various urban, industrial or rural zones in Madrid (Spain). Methylparaben was found in most of the WWTPs sampled (95%) at levels between 5.1 and 26.2 ng g(-1) dry weight and propylparaben was detected in 74% of the WWTPs at levels up to 44.1 ng g(-1) dry weight. In order to study the temporal variation of parabens and two chlorinated parabens during a four-year period, sludge samples were collected from 3 selected WWTPs. The levels of methylparaben encountered were rather constant throughout the sampling period whereas propylparaben levels slightly increased. In one of the WWTPs monitored, isopropylparaben was found at the beginning of the sampling period but its content decreased and was not detected in the 2010 sampling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment and their potential effects on living organisms has become an issue of growing concern. Among emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals may enter the aquatic environment due to their high consumption and their incomplete removal in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
   The main goal of this study was the assessment of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals found in municipal wastewater of a coastal WWTP (Castell-Platja d'Aro, Spain) using an integrated pilot scale membrane system (MBR-RO).
   Twenty multiple-class pharmaceuticals (including psychiatric drugs, macrolide antibiotics, beta-blockers, sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, histamine H-2 receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatories, nitroimidazole, beta-agonist and antiplatelet agent) were measured in real influent with the lowest average concentration for psychiatric drugs (0.017 mu g L-1) to the highest for macrolide antibiotics (2.02 mu g L-1). Although some contaminants were in relatively high concentrations (even up to 2.90 mu g L-1 in the case of ofloxacin).
   The combination of MBR and RO treatment showed excellent overall removal of target emerging contaminants with removal rates above 99% for all of them. For some compounds (metronidazole, hydrocodone, codein, ranitidine) MBR provided high removal efficiency (up to 95%). Additionally RO membrane showed removal rates always higher than 99%.

AB Previous studies have suggested the use of sucralose, a synthetic non-nutritive sweetener, as an indicator of domestic wastewater loading to surface waters. This paper presents a novel flow schematic approach for quantifying volumetric load contributions from different water sources by utilizing sucralose as a master diagnostic variable in combination with other trace compounds. This conceptual approach was validated through demonstration of sucralose presence at positive field sites susceptible to either water reuse or septic infiltration and its absence at negative field sites. Differences in the ratios of carbamazepine to sucralose and gadolinium anomaly to sucralose were demonstrated for eight septic and water reuse effluents. Utilization of these ratios as a means of distinguishing septic and water reuse loading to water bodies merits additional study. In the absence of sustained loading, the use of carbamazepine might be hindered by photolysis and gadolinium anomaly might be hindered when volumetric loading is less than 20%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of sludge (biosolids) in land application may Contribute to the spread. of organic micro pollutants as wastewater treatments do not completely remove these compounds. Therefore, the development of alternative strategies for sludge treatment is a matter of recent concern. The elimination, of pharmaceuticals at, pre-existent concentrations from sewage sludge was assessed, for the first time, in nonsterile biopiles by Means of fungal bioaugmentation with Trametes versicolor (BTV-systems) and compared with the effect of autochthonous microbiota (NB systems) The Competition between the autochthonous fungal/bacterial communities and T. versicolor was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.(DGGE) and the cloning/sequencing approach. An inhibitory effect exerted by T versicolor over bacterial populations was suggested. However, after 21 days, T. versicolor was no longer the main taxon in the fungal communities. The elimination profiles revealed an enhanced removal of atorvastatin-diclofenac-hydrochlorothiazide (during the whole treatment) and ranitidine-fenofibrate (at short periods) in the BTV biopiles in respect to NB biopiles, coincident with the presence of the fungus. For ibuprofen-clarithromycin-furosemide, the elimination Profiles were similar irrespective of the system, and with carbamazepine no significant degradation was obtained. The results suggest that a fungal treatment with T versicolor could be a promising process for the remediation of some pharmaceuticals in complex matrices such as biosolids.

AB Titanium dioxide is widely used as an effective catalyst in wastewater treatment. The effects of drug carriers (cyclodextrins, 100 mu M) or dissolved humic acids (0-50 mg/L) or pH (3.0-11.0) on adsorption of norfloxacin to two TiO2 (Hombikat UV-100 and Anatase TiO2) surfaces were systematically studied. Norfloxacin shows high adsorption affinity to TiO2 surface. Specific surface area of TiO2 shows great influence on norfloxacin adsorption especially in acidic solutions. The effect of pH on norfloxacin adsorption originates from the changes of TiO2's surface charge and speciation of norfloxacin. The presence of humic acids (50 mg/L) suppresses the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Hombikat UV-100 and Anatase TiO2 prominently. The co-effect of heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (methyl-beta-CD) and humic acid is similar to the solo effect of humic acid on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Hombikat UV-100, while the co-effect shows a more retardation effect on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto Anatase TiO2. Humic acid and beta-CD show a synergetic depressed effect on the adsorption of norfloxacin onto both TiO2 surfaces. These results show that both aquatic solution chemistry and drug carrier are important to norfloxacin adsorption on TiO2, which could alter the environmental fate and transport of norfloxacin.

AB Even though Ibuprofen is one of the most studied pharmaceutical in the aquatic environment, there is still a lack of information about its fate and the generation of different transformation products along wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Ibuprofen biotransformation products can be generated by human metabolism or by microorganisms present in WWTPs and in natural waters, soils, and sediments, which increase the probability to find them in environment. In this work, the presence of ibuprofen and its main metabolites: ibuprofen carboxylic acid (CBX IBU), 2-hydroxylated ibuprofen (2-OH IBU) and 1-hydroxylated ibuprofen (1-OH IBU), was monitored quantitatively along the biodegradation processes occurring in different batch activated sludge (BAS) experiments under different working conditions. Total ibuprofen removal, achieved in almost all the experiments, was related in part to the formation of the metabolites mentioned. Another ibuprofen metabolite, 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, was detected in BAS experiments for the first time. The metabolites 2-OH IBU and 1-OH IBU remained in solution at the end of ibuprofen biodegradation experiments whereas CBX IBU disappeared faster than hydroxylated metabolites. In addition, also the biodegradation of 1-OH IBU, 2-OH IBU and CBX IBU was evaluated in batch experiments: CBX IBU removal occurred at the highest rate followed by IBU, 2-OH IBU, and 1-OH IBU, which exhibited the lowest removal rate. Finally, Ibuprofen and ibuprofen metabolites were monitored in sewage and natural water samples, where they were found at higher levels than expected: the maximum concentration in influent wastewater samples were 13.74, 5.8, 38.4, 94.0 mu g/L for IBU, 1-OH IBU, CBX IBU and 2-OH IBU respectively: whereas maximum levels in effluent wastewater samples were 1.9, 1.4, 10.7, 5.9 mu g/L for IBU, 1-OH IBU, CBX IBU and 2-OH IBU respectively. High levels of the compounds were also found in river samples, in particular for CBX IBU, which was detected up to 3.9 mu g/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reuse of wastewater for agricultural irrigation purposes is gaining popularity in water scarce regions. This practice represents a cheap and easy method of wastewater disposal, as well as an alternative to attenuate the water demand for agriculture without compromising fresh water sources. However, during agricultural irrigation, contaminants contained in wastewater migrate to the soil and may eventually reach the aquifer, causing deterioration of groundwater quality. Micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals, have been detected in wastewater used for irrigation around the world; these pollutants have even been found in groundwater, but in lower concentrations than those observed in wastewater. This may be because the micropollutants are retained or removed by soil during the passage of wastewater through the solid matrix. The processes involved in such retention/dissipation may be sorption or biodegradation. In this study, the sorption and mobility of two micropollutants: di-2-ethyl(hexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) were evaluated in three different soil types (Leptosol, Phaeozem and Vertisol) using batch and soil column experiments. The results obtained were compared in order to understand how these compounds mobilize through the soil until they reach the aquifer. The batch sorption experiments showed that both compounds are rapidly sorbed onto the soils. DEHP was strongly sorbed onto the three soils (K-d from 1.8 x 10(4) to 4.2 x 10(4) L kg(-1)), while sorption of 4-NP was weaker (K-d between 15 and 80 L kg(-1)), Conversely, the column experiment results demonstrated that DEHP mobilizes faster than 4-NP through the three soils. The transport of DEHP may be explained by complexation of DEHP with the dissolved organic matter released from the soil or by the attachment to soil colloids. The results obtained in the batch experiments are in line with those reported in the literature, while the observations made in the column experiments were consistent with the field data.

AB Ozonation of water effluent polluted with carbamazepine an ubiquitous and refractory pharmaceutical contaminant, has been addressed. This paper aims to optimize the remediation process through novel considerations, such as economical aspects of operational costs. To this end, firstly, we have defined an efficiency variable which included not only global efficacy terms (pollutant removal) but also kinetic aspects, which has to do with the ozonation chemical rate. This target variable was involved in a design of experiments that optimized air flow, ozone concentration, and pollutant initial content. An optimum was obtained at 55 L.h(-1), 0.4 g.m(3), and 18 mg.L-1 respectively.

AB The fate of the three environmentally relevant beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol has been studied in batch experiments involving aquifer material and nitrate reducing conditions. Results from the about 90d long tests indicate that abiotic processes, most likely sorption, jointly with biotransformation to atenololic acid were responsible for the 65% overall removal observed for atenolol. Zero order kinetics, typical of enzyme-limited reactions, controlled the transformation of this beta blocker to its corresponding carboxylic acid. The mass balance evidences that no mineralization of atenolol occurs in the biotic experiment and that atenololic acid is more stable than its parent compound under the studied conditions. This finding stresses the importance of considering atenololic acid as target compound in the environmental studies on the fate of atenolol. For metoprolol and propranolol the results from the experiment suggest a slower sorption to be the dominant removal process, which led to final decreases in concentrations of 25-30% and 40-45%, respectively. Overall, the removals observed in the experiments suggest that subsurface processes potentially constitute an alternative water treatment for the target beta-blockers, when compared to the removals reported for conventional wastewater treatment plants.

AB An extensive study on the presence of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals with potential for abuse in sewage waters was made for the first time in the Netherlands. A total number of 24 target drugs were investigated in influent and effluent wastewater using liquid chromatography coupled to a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. This powerful analyzer has allowed not only the detection and identification of the compounds under investigation, but also their quantification at very low levels, which is highly innovative in the field of drugs of abuse. Samples were taken from five sewage treatment plants (STPs) during a whole week. The selected STPs served four cities of different size and an international airport. Daily variances of drug loads were demonstrated and removal efficiencies calculated for each drug and STP individually. Twelve target compounds were found in at least one influent or effluent, and highest concentrations were observed in influents collected from more urbanized areas. The compounds more frequently detected were amphetamine. benzoylecgonine. cocaine and THC-COOH together with the pharmaceuticals codeine, oxazepam and temazepam. Established week trends in consumption of drugs showed distinct differences between individual drugs. A slightly different occurrence pattern was observed in wastewaters from the airport. Thus, methamphetamine was only detected at Schiphol, a fact that was interpreted to be caused by consumption of this drug by travelers. Despite the fact that the Netherlands has frequently been criticized for its liberal drug policy the results from this study did not reveal higher drug consumption than found elsewhere, with the exception of cannabis.

AB The plant uptake of emerging organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is receiving increased attention. Biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment have been previously identified as a major source for PPCPs. Thus, plant uptake of PPCPs from biosolids applied soils needs to be understood. In the present study, the uptake of carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and triclocarban by five vegetable crop plants was examined in a field experiment. At the time of harvest, three compounds were detected in all plants grown in biosolids-treated soils. Calculated root concentration factor (RCF) and shoot concentration factor (SCF) are the highest for carbamazepine followed by triclocarban and diphenhydramine. Positive correlation between RCF and root lipid content was observed for carbamazepine but not for diphenhydramine and triclocarban. The results demonstrate the ability of crop plants to accumulate PPCPs from contaminated soils. The plant uptake processes of PPCPs are likely affected by their physico-chemical properties, and their interaction with soil. The difference uptake behavior between plant species could not solely be attributed to the root lipid content. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fibrates are a class of pharmaceuticals that indirectly modulate cholesterol biosynthesis through effects on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that has been detected in wastewater treatment plant influents, effluents, and drinking water. The objective of the present study was to assess the potential physiological and reproductive impacts of gemfibrozil on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were exposed to gemfibrozil in two different studies. The first was a short-term test with water concentrations of 0, 15, and 600 mu g gemfibrozil/L, sampling after 2 or 8 d of exposure. Plasma cholesterol concentrations were significantly reduced in males exposed to 600 mu g gemfibrozil/L for 8 d. In addition, expression of several hepatic genes important to lipid metabolism was altered, suggesting that gemfibrozil does affect lipid metabolism in fish. A 21-d study was conducted to investigate further the effects on lipid metabolism and steroidogenesis as well as to assess potential impacts of gemfibrozil on reproduction. Fish were exposed to water concentrations of 0, 1.5, 15, 600, and 1,500 mu g gemfibrozil/L. Exposure to 1,500 mu g gemfibrozil/L caused a modest, but not significant, reduction in fecundity. However, gemfibrozil had no consistent effect on plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, or sex steroids after 21 d of exposure. The present study showed no evidence for significant physiological or reproductive impacts of gemfibrozil at an environmentally relevant concentration of 1.5 mu g/L. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The growing interest in the environmental occurrence of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals is essentially due to their possible health implications to humans and ecosystem. This study assesses the occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in a Malaysian tropical aquatic environment taking a chemometric approach using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. Water samples were collected from seven sampling stations along the heavily populated Langat River basin on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia and its main tributaries. Water samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 18 pharmaceuticals and one metabolite, which cover a range of six therapeutic classes widely consumed in Malaysia. Cluster analysis was applied to group both pharmaceutical pollutants and sampling stations. Cluster analysis successfully clustered sampling stations and pollutants into three major clusters. Discriminant analysis was applied to identify those pollutants which had a significant impact in the definition of clusters. Finally, principal component analysis using a three-component model determined the constitution and data variance explained by each of the three main principal components.

AB The goal of this study was to compare removal efficiencies of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) using typical wastewater treatment technologies, and to identify the most significant mechanisms of removal. Two types of municipal wastewater reactors were studied: a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) reactor with tertiary treatment; and three pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) having different sludge retention times (SRTs). All four reactors were fed the same influent. A third reactor type, a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was fed tap water, ammonia, and TBBPA. TBBPA in municipal influent ranged from 1 to 41 ng L-1 (n = 10). The CAS effluent had an average TBBPA concentration of 0.7 +/- 1.3 ng L-1 (n = 3). Effluent concentrations from the MBRs were an average of 6 +/- 6 ng L-1 TBBPA (n = 26). Significant TBBPA removal was observed in the MABR throughout the 5 week of study (p >= 0.05). Removal of TBBPA from wastewater treatment was found to be due to a combination of adsorption and biological degradation. Based on experimental results, nitrification is likely a key process therein. No significant relationship between removal of TBBPA and SRT was identified (p >= 0.05). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine and cetirizine were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in surface and wastewaters from Berlin, Germany. This fast and cost-efficient method enabled to assess the spatial and temporal variation of these anthropogenic markers in a high-throughput screening. CBZ and cetirizine were detected by the same antibody, which selectively discriminates between both compounds depending on the pH value used in the incubation step. To our best knowledge, this is the first dual-analyte immunoassay working with a single antibody.
   The frequent sampling with 487 samples being processed allowed for the repeated detection of unusually high concentrations of CBZ and caffeine. ELISA results correlate well with the ones obtained by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Caffeine concentrations found in surface waters were elevated by combined sewer overflows after stormwater events. During the hay fever season, the concentrations of the antihistamine drug cetirizine increased in both surface and wastewaters.
   Caffeine was almost completely removed during wastewater treatment, while CBZ and cetirizine were found to be more persistent. The maximum concentrations of caffeine, CBZ and cetirizine found in influent wastewater by LC-MS/MS were 470, 5.0 and 0.49 mu g L-1, while in effluent wastewater the concentrations were 0.22, 4.5 and 0.51 mu g L-1, respectively. For surface waters, concentrations up to 3.3, 4.5 and 0.72 mu g L-1 were found, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the presence and distribution of 22 antibiotics, including eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides, in the water, sediments, and biota samples from Baiyangdian Lake, China. A total of 132 samples were collected in 2008 and 2010, and laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the lake. Sulfonamides were the dominant antibiotics in the water (0.86-1563 ng L-1), while quinolones were prominent in sediments (65.5-1166 mu g kg(-1)) and aquatic plants (8.37-6532 mu g kg(-1)). Quinolones (17.8-167 mu g kg(-1)) and macrolides [from below detection limit (BDL) to 182 mu g kg(-1)] were often found in aquatic animals and birds. Salvinia natans exhibited the highest bioaccumulation capability for quinolones among three species of aquatic plants. Geographical differences of antibiotic concentrations were greatly due to anthropogenic activities. Sewage discharged from Baoding City was likely the main source of antibiotics in the lake. Risk assessment of antibiotics on aquatic organisms suggested that algae and aquatic plants might be at risk in surface water, while animals were likely not at risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This manuscript reports, for the first time, a monitoring study analysing wastewater and associated suspended particulate matter (SPM) to determine the concentration of drugs of abuse and metabolites in wastewater influent. The monitoring of SPM is crucial for target analytes because, depending on their physico-chemical properties, they may partition to particulates; thus, analysis of wastewater only will result in under-reporting of the concentration of target analytes in the sample. A daily one week monitoring study was carried out at a WWTP serving one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic; representing the first comprehensive application of the sewage epidemiology approach in the Czech Republic. In total. 60 analytes were targeted in the monitoring programme including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzo-diazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors and their metabolites. Analysis of SPM determined that significant proportions of some compounds were present on the solids. For example, 21.0-49.8% of the total concentration of EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) in the sample was determined on SPM and 11.2-19.6% of methadone. The highest proportion on SPM was determined for fluoxetine in the range 68.1-79.6%, norfluoxetine 46.6-61.9% and amitriptyline 21.8-51.2%. In contrast, some compounds presented very little partitioning to SPM. Less than 5% was determined partitioned to SPM over the week period for analytes including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol, nortramadol, oxazepam and ephedrine. Determined concentrations in wastewater influent were subsequently utilised in the sewage epidemiology approach to estimate drug consumption, in the community from which the wastewater was derived. This back-calculation was updated for the first time to include the concentration of analytes present on SPM. The consumption of methamphetamine and MDMA was determined to be especially high in the studied community in relation to other European countries, while cocaine and methadone consumption was relatively low. This manuscript shows that in order to apply the sewage epidemiology approach, SPM analysis is required for some compounds; whereas for others the partitioning is small and one may regard this as negligible.

AB Concern over steroid estrogens has increased rapidly in recent years due to their adverse health effects. Effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is the main pollutant source for environmental water. To understand the pollutant level and fate of steroid estrogens in WWTPs, the occurrence of estrone (E1), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 17-beta-ethinylestradiol (EE2) was investigated in the Gaobeidian WWTP in Beijing, China. Water samples from influent as well as effluent from second sedimentation tanks and advanced treatment processes were taken monthly during 2006 to 2007. In influent, steroid estrogen concentrations varied from 11.6 to 1.1 x 10(2) ng/l, 3.7 to 1.4 x 10(2) ng/l, no detection (nd) to 7.6x10(2) ng/l and nd to 3.3 x 10(2) ng/l for E1, E2, E3, and EE2, respectively. Compared with documented values, the higher steroid estrogen concentrations in the WWTP influent may be due to higher population density, higher birthrate, less dilution, and different sampling time. Results revealed that a municipal WWTP with an activated sludge system incorporating anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic processes could eliminate natural and synthetic estrogens effectively. The mean elimination efficiencies were 83.2%, 96.4%, 98.8%, and 93.0% for E1, E2, E3, and EE2, respectively. The major removal mechanism for natural estrogens and synthetic estrogen EE2 were biodegradation and sorption on the basis of mass balance in water, suspension particles, and sludge. In the WWTP effluent, however, the highest concentrations of E1, E2, E3, and EE2 attained were 74.2, 3.9, 5.1, and 4.6 ng/l, respectively. This is concerning as residual steroid estrogens in WWTP effluent could lead to pollution of the receiving water. Advanced flocculation treatment was applied in the WWTP and transformed the residual estrogen conjugates to free species, which were reduced further by filtration with removal shifting from 32% to 57% for natural estrogen, although no EE2 was removed.

TI Uptake of human pharmaceuticals and personal care products by cabbage

AB Human pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are routinely found in biosolids from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Once land applied, the PPCPs in biosolids are potentially available for plant uptake and bioaccumulation. This study used a greenhouse model to investigate uptake of PPCPs commonly detected in biosolids by the agricultural plant Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris). Two series of greenhouse experiments were conducted as part of this project. In the first set of experiments, four pharmaceuticals were added to an organic matter-rich soil in environmentally relevant concentrations based on typical biosolids application rates, resulting in final soil concentrations of 2.6 ng g(-1) carbamazepine, 3.1 ng g(-1) sulfamethoxazole, 5.4 ng g(-1) salbutamol, and 0.5 ng g(-1) trimethoprim. In the second set of experiments, the cabbage was grown in soil amended with an agronomic rate of biosolids from a local WWTP. The ambient concentration of PPCPs in the biosolids resulted in final soil concentrations of 93.1 ng g(-1) carbamazepine, 67.4 ng g(-1) sulfamethoxazole, 30.3 ng g(-1) salbutamol, 433.7 ng g(-1) triclosan, and 24.7 ng g(-1) trimethoprim. After growing to maturity, the aerials of the plants were separated from roots and the two tissue types were analyzed separately. All four human pharmaceuticals were detected in both tissues in the cabbage grown in the soil fortified with the four pharmaceuticals with median concentrations of 255.4 ng g(-1) aerials and 272.9 ng g(-1) roots carbamazepine; 222.8 ng g(-1) aerials and 260.3 ng g(-1) roots sulfamethoxazole; 108.3 ng g(-1) aerials and 140.6 ng g(-1) roots salbutamol; and 20.6 ng g(-1) aerials and 53.7 ng g(-1) roots trimethoprim. Although all study compounds were present in the biosolids-amended planting soil, only carbamazepine (317.6 ng g(-1) aerials and 416.2 ng g(-1) roots), salbutamol (21.2 ng g(-1) aerials and 187.6 ng g(-1) roots), and triclosan (22.9 ng g(-1) aerials and 1220.1 ng g(-1) roots) were detected in the aerials of the cabbage. In addition to the study compounds detected in the aerials, sulfamethoxazole was detected in the roots of one of the plants in the biosolid-amended soil. In comparison to many previous studies that have utilized PPCP concentration that exceed environmentally relevant concentrations, plants in this study were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the PPCPs, yet resulted in uptake concentrations similar to or greater than those reported in comparable studies. We suggest that rhizosphere conditions, particularly the presence of dissolved organicmatter in the planting matrix, might be one of the critical factors determining mobilization and bioavailability of xenobiotic compounds such as PPCPs.

AB This study describes an investigation on the occurrence of 27 pharmaceutical compounds, belonging to different classes, in the effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving water bodies in the sensitive area of the Po Valley (northern Italy). These canals were monitored upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge points in order to evaluate the effluent impact on the quality of surface waters, commonly used for irrigation. An environmental risk assessment was also conducted by calculating the risk quotient, i.e. the ratio between measured concentration and predicted no effect concentration.
   Collected data show that, although average values of the selected compounds were in general higher in the effluent than in the surface waters, some compounds not detected in the WWTP effluent were detected in the receiving water (upstream as well as downstream), indicating that sources other than treated effluents are present as contaminations during extraction and analysis have to be excluded. The most critical compounds for the environment were found to be the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The study shows that the potential toxicological effects of persistent micropollutants can be mitigated to some extent by a high dilution capacity, i.e. a high average flow rate in the receiving water body with respect to the effluent.

ID POTENTIAL IMPACTS; FRAGRANCES; ECOTOXICITY; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; RISK;
   FATE
AB After ingestion, pharmaceuticals are excreted unchanged or metabolized. They subsequently arrive in conventional wastewater treatment plants and are then released into the environment, often without undergoing any degradation. Conventional treatment plants can be upgraded with post treatment, alternatively the removal of pharmaceuticals could be achieved directly at point sources. In the European project PILLS, several solutions for decentralized treatment of pharmaceuticals at hospitals were investigated at both pilot plant and full scale, and were then compared to conventional and upgraded centralized treatment plants using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Within the scope of the study, pharmaceuticals were found to have a comparatively minor environmental impact. As a consequence, an additional post treatment does not provide significant benefits. In the comparison of post treatment technologies, ozonation and activated carbon performed better than UV. These results suffer however from high uncertainties due to the assessment models of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in LCA. Our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. LCA is a holistic approach and does not cover effects or issues on a local level, which may be highly relevant. We should therefore apply the precautionary ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) and not conclude that the effect of pharmaceuticals is negligible in the environment.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are commonly detected organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. Their actual fate in rivers is still incompletely understood as their elimination is highly substance specific and studies often report contradictory results. To elucidate the ceiling of attenuation rates of pharmaceuticals in rivers we carried out a study at a river with favorable conditions for the elimination of organic micropollutants.
   Experiments were carried out at a small stream in Germany. Composite samples were taken at both ends of a 12.5 km long river stretch located downstream of a sewage treatment plant and analyzed for 10 pharmaceuticals. Moreover, pore water samples were taken and in situ photolysis experiments at several sites within the river stretch were performed to assess the importance of these individual elimination mechanisms.
   Pharmaceutical concentration in the surface water at the first sampling site ranged from 3.5 ng L-1 for propranolol to 1400 ng L-1 for diclofenac. In comparison to carbamazepine which was used as persistent tracer, all other pharmaceuticals were attenuated along the river stretch. Their elimination was higher in a sunny, dry weather period (period I) compared to a period with elevated discharge after a heavy rainfall (period II). Overall, the measured elimination rates ranged from 25% for sulfamethoxazole (period II) to 70% for propranolol (period I). Photolysis was only a relevant elimination process for diclofenac and potentially also for sotalol; for these compounds phototransformation half-life times of some hours were determined in the unshaded parts of the river. Biotransformation in the sediments was also an important attenuation process since the concentrations of the other pharmaceuticals in the sediments decreased relative to carbamazepine with depth. For the chiral betablocker metoprolol this biotransformation was also confirmed by a decrease in the enantiomer fractionation from 0.49 at site A to 0.43 at site B and to <0.40 in the deeper sediments.

AB The fate of 14 antidepressants along with their respective N-desmethyl metabolites and the anticonvulsive drug carbamazepine (CBZ) was studied in 5 different sewage treatment plants (STPs) across Canada. Using two validated LC-MS/MS analytical methods, the concentrations of the different compounds were determined in raw influent, final effluent and treated biosolids samples. Out of the 15 compounds investigated, 13 were positively detected in most 24-h composite raw influent samples. Analysis showed that venlafaxine (VEN), its metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (DVEN), citalopram (CIT), and CBZ were detected at the highest concentrations in raw influent (up to 4.3 mu g L-1 for DVEN). Cumulated results showed strong evidence that primary treatment and trickling filter/solids contact has limited capacity to remove antidepressants from sewage, while activated sludge, biological aerated filter, and biological nutrient removal processes yielded moderate results (mean removal rates: 30%). The more recalcitrant compounds to be eliminated from secondary STPs were VEN, DVEN and CBZ with mean removal rates close to 12%. Parent compounds were removed to a greater degree than their metabolites. The highest mean concentrations in treated biosolids samples were found for CIT (1033 ng g(-1)), amitriptyline (768 ng g(-1)), and VEN (833 ng g(-1)). Experimental sorption coefficients (K-d) were also determined. The lowest K-d values were obtained with VEN, DVEN, and CBZ (67 -490 L kg(-1)). Sorption of these compounds on solids was assumed negligible (log K-d <= 2). However, important sorption on solids was observed for sertraline, desmethylsertraline, paroxetine and fluoxetine (log K-d > 4). Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work investigated the application of a solar driven advanced oxidation process (solar photo-Fenton), for the degradation of antibiotics at low concentration level (mu g L-1) in secondary treated domestic effluents at a pilot-scale. The examined antibiotics were ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP). A compound parabolic collector (CPC) pilot plant was used for the photocatalytic experiments. The process was mainly evaluated by a fast and reliable analytical method based on a UPLC-MS/MS system. Solar photo-Fenton process using low iron and hydrogen peroxide doses ([Fe2+](0) = 5 mg L-1; [H2O2](0) = 75 mg L-1) was proved to be an efficient method for the elimination of these compounds with relatively high degradation rates. The photocatalytic degradation of OFX and TMP with the solar photo-Fenton process followed apparent first-order kinetics. A modification of the first-order kinetic expression was proposed and has been successfully used to explain the degradation kinetics of the compounds during the solar photo-Fenton treatment. The results demonstrated the capacity of the applied advanced process to reduce the initial wastewater toxicity against the examined plant species (Sorghum saccharatum, Lepidium sativum, Sinapis alba) and the water flea Daphnia magna. The phytotoxicity of the treated samples, expressed as root growth inhibition, was higher compared to that observed on the inhibition of seed germination. Enterococci, including those resistant to OFX and TMP, were completely eliminated at the end of the treatment. The total cost of the full scale unit for the treatment of 150 m(3) day(-1) of secondary wastewater effluent was found to be 0.85 (sic) m(-3). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of cation exchange processes on the transport behavior of the cationic beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol was investigated by applying saturated laboratory column experiments. Breakthrough curves using natural sediments under different competitive conditions were generated and resulting sorption coefficients were compared. For the cationic species of atenolol (at pH = 8), the existence and dominating role of cation exchange processes were demonstrated by varying calcium concentrations. No effect of atenolol concentration on its retardation was observed within a wide concentration range. The breakthrough curve comparison of atenolol and the more hydrophobic metoprolol under constant conditions showed a significantly stronger retardation for metoprolol than for atenolol. However, additional non-polar interactions cannot explain the observed differences as they are determined to be negligible for both compounds. Due to the dominating role of cation exchange processes for the cationic species on overall sorption, a simple prediction of beta-blocker transport in the subsurface by using K-OC values derived from log K-OW-log K-OC correlations is not feasible.

AB CWO (catalytic wet oxidation) of a process wastewater and phenolate solution was carried out at 230 degrees C, 200 degrees C and total pressure of 50 bar, with oxygen, in a stainless steel autoclave. Monolith Ti mesh supported precious metal oxide catalysts were characterized with XPS, ICP-MS, SEM and their activity compared in oxidation of model and real wastewaters.
   The Ru/Ir oxide coated Ti monolith catalysts showed remarkable catalytic activity in wet oxidation both in the overall oxidation expressed by COD (chemical oxygen demand) decrease and in the carbon mineralization expressed by TOC (total organic carbon) decrease. This was valid for the real pharmaceutical wastewater as well as for a phenolate solution too. Meshes containing Ru, Pd and Ir oxide alone were less active than Ru/Ir together on Ti. This observation is in accordance with the electrochemical properties of the same mesh used in hypochlorite production.
   The commercial mesh was most stable under the conditions of wet oxidation, however the loss of its precious metal content was observed during longer usage. The Ru/Ir monolith catalysts prepared in our laboratories had similar initial activity but they were less stable, the leaching and/or abrasion of the surface precious metal oxide layer was faster, independently of that their had fragmented or continuous structure, resulting from the preparation methods.
   The loss of activity during longer usage can be the result of deposition of iron and silicon oxides too, as showed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis.
   An important feature of the good catalytic activity of the Ru/Ir oxide coated Ti mesh can be the uniform distribution of the two oxides showed by LA-ICPMS (laser ablation-inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry). According to XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) results, the upper surface layer of the catalysts is covered by a mixture of Ru-Ir-Ti oxide of approximately 0.1:0.02:1 atomic ratio for commercial catalyst, and an 0.5:0.7:1.0 atomic ratio for catalysts prepared in our laboratories. We suppose that such mixture of oxides with uniform distribution are the carrier of the good catalytic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater streams, but little is known regarding their roles in membrane fouling during the operation of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study attempted to understand the role of ciprofloxacin exposure in control of filamentous bulking as well as membrane fouling mitigation. Compared with the control MBR, results show that the ciprofloxacin could selectively inhibit and kill filaments present in the mixed liquor, and, as a consequence, the sludge settleability improved significantly. The addition of ciprofloxacin had little influence on organic removals and nitrification, but had an adverse effect on denitrification. In addition, the sludge flocs exposure to ciprofloxacin still kept in compact structure; specifically, granular sludge was finally formed possibly due to the increase of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) corroborated the enrichment of polysaccharides in the EPS exposure to ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, because of the release of EPS and the decay of filaments, soluble microbial products (SMP), particularly soluble polysaccharides, increased significantly in the MBR exposure to ciprofloxacin. Despite this, the results of this study show that the presence of trace contaminants in wastewater streams may play some positive roles in MBR fouling control.

AB Land application of recycled manure produced from biosolids and reclaimed wastewater can transfer pharmaceutical chemicals to terrestrial environments, giving rise to potential accumulation of these residues in edible plants. In this study, the potential for plant uptake of 13 pharmaceutical chemicals, and the relation between the accumulation features within the plant and the physicochemical properties were examined by exposing pea and cucumber to an aqueous solution containing pharmaceutical chemicals. Ten of 13 compounds tested were detected in plant leaves and stems. Comparison of the plant uptake characteristics and the octanol water partition coefficient of pharmaceutical chemicals showed that compounds with an intermediate polarity such as carbamazepine and crotamiton could be easily transported to plant shoots. Moreover, these results suggest the possibility of highly hydrophilic pharmaceutical chemicals such as trimethoprim and sulfonamides to be accumulated in plant roots owing to their low permeability in root cell membranes.

AB This study assessed seasonal and regional trends of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) detected in monthly samples from two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, over the period of one year. Surface water of Charleston Harbor was also analyzed to examine environmental distribution in an estuarine ecosystem. Of the 19 compounds examined, 11 were quantified in wastewater influent, 9 in effluent, and 7 in surface water. Aqueous concentrations of many PPCPs were reduced by >86% in wastewater effluent compared with influent, though some compounds showed low removal and greater effluent concentrations compared with influent (e.g. estrone and fluoxetine). Differences in effluent concentrations and estimated removal between facilities were likely related to variations in the facilities' operating procedures. Surface water concentrations were generally reduced by >90% for those chemicals found in effluent. Additionally, there were seasonal trends that indicate reduced degradation in colder months in wastewater and surface water. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining PPCPs in the South Atlantic Bight. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the development and application of a new multi-residue analytical method providing the first data on the environmental occurrence of human pharmaceuticals in Africa, particularly the Nairobi River basin (Kenya).
   Based on pharmaceutical consumption data available for the Nairobi region, 43 'priority' pharmaceutically active ingredients (PAIs) were selected for this study. On the basis of magnetic sector high-resolution mass spectrometry, a new methodology involving both full-scan screening and selective target analysis has been developed to investigate the presence of the defined priority PAIs. Subsequent analysis of the corresponding standard compounds provided the full confirmation and indicative concentrations (low ng/L-high mu g/L) of 10 human PAIs in the Nairobi River. The detected compounds belong to different classes, i.e. antibiotics, analgesic/anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic drugs, antimalarials and antiretrovirals. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole and zidovudine showed to be the most concentrated PAIs (about 10-30 mu g/L). The concentration of the antiretrovirals (lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine) is clearly higher than those reported in the literature, although environmental data on this class of PAIs are still very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence of detection of lamivudine in surface water. The presented unique data on the occurrence of selected PAIs in the aquatic environment of Africa clearly show that the high prevalence of specific diseases like HIV/AIDS infection in developing countries might result in a different pattern of PAIs in environmental waters compared to the more developed regions.

AB The advent of increasingly stringent and wider ranging European Union legislation relating to water and the environment has required regulators to assess compliance risk and to respond by formulating appropriate pollution control measures. To support this process the UK Water Industry has completed a national Chemicals Investigation Programme (CIP), to monitor over 160 wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) for 70 determinands. Final effluent concentrations of zinc, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene and indeno(1,2,3-cd) pyrene), "penta" congeners (BDEs) 47 and 99, tributyltin, triclosan, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, ibuprofen, propranolol, fluoxetine, diclofenac, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol exceeded existing or proposed Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) in over 50% of WwTWs. Dilution by receiving water might ensure compliance with EQSs for these chemicals, apart from the BDEs. However, in some cases there will be insufficient dilution to ensure compliance and additional management options may be required. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study addressed the formation and properties of degradation products of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and lomefloxacin formed during ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent containing these fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The generation of the degradation products was interpreted in the context of transformations of effluent organic matter (EfOM) tracked via absorbance measurements. The structures of 20 degradation products were elucidated for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. 27 degradation products were identified for lomefloxacin. The prevalent oxidation pathways were suggested based on the structures of the identified products formed in the absence and presence of the hydroxyl radical scavenger t-butanol. These pathways were largely similar for all studied fluoroquinolones and involved attacks on the piperazine ring and the quinolone structure. The quinolone ring remained intact in the presence of t-butanol thus indicating that this functional group could only be oxidized by OH radicals while the piperazine ring was readily oxidized by molecular ozone. The cleavage of the quinolone moiety that resulted in several identified degradation products occurred via the attack by hydroxyl radicals on the carbon carbon double bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Lomefloxacin had more diverse oxidation products due to the presence of a methyl group on its piperazinyl ring. The concentrations of the identified degradation products behaved non-monotonically as a function of ozone dose or treatment time, yet exhibited interpretable correlations versus changes of EfOM absorbance. Examination of these correlations allowed developing a novel approach for elucidating the transformations of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during ozonation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (beta-blocker) that is frequently used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions in humans. Detected in surface waters due to discharge of domestic wastewater, propranolol has demonstrated significant species differences in toxicity between fish. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of propranolol on heart rate and development in embryos of two species of fish; Japanese medaka (JM) Oryzias latipes and zebrafish (ZF) Danio rerio. Parents and fertilized embryos of each species were exposed to nominal (measured) concentrations of 0.1 (0.09), 1 (1.1) and 10 (8.3) mu g/L of propranolol. Heart rate was monitored during subsequent exposure in embryos at incremental developmental periods (44, 54, 64 h post-fertilization (hpf) for ZF and 68, 116, 164 hpf for JM). Heart development and morphology was examined using whole mount immunostaining with distance measurements between the sinus venosus (SV) and bulbus arteriosis (BV). Morphological measurements were made at 44 hpf for ZF and 164 hpf for JM. In ZF, a significant reduction in heart rate was observed at 0.08 mu g/L propranolol, along with an increase in the SV-BA distance at 44 hpf. Significant reductions in heart rate were also observed in ZF at 54 and 64 hpf at all concentrations of propranolol. For JM, heart rates generally decreased at all developmental timepoints (68, 116 and 164 hpf) after propranolol treatment, with concentration dependent decreases observed at 164 hpf and a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 0.09 mu g/L propranolol at each timepoint. However, significant alterations in cardiac morphology were not observed in JM at 164 hpf. In contrast, heart rates and morphology in ZF were affected with a non-monotonic concentration response in morphology and a LOEC of 0.09 mu g/L propranolol for morphological alterations at 44 hpf and for heart rate at each timepoint. These data indicated unique developmental stages of susceptibility between species and that combined parental and embryo exposures may lead to greater impairment of cardiac development and function in offspring than separate exposures of adults and embryos.

AB The present study describes the evaluation of the risk posed by the occurrence of sulfonamides (SAs) in wastewaters. A fully automated analytical method based on on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (on line SPE-LC-MS/MS) was developed, validated and applied for the analysis of sixteen SAs and, for the first time in wastewaters and sewage sludge, five of their acetylated metabolites. Influent and effluent samples from twenty two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Catalonia (Spain) and sewage sludge from fifteen of them were analyzed: removal rates (RE%) and half-lives (t(1/2)) for each SA were calculated. The estimated correlations between RE% and to the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the different plants indicated no clear influence of HRT on removals. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfapyridine (SPY) and their corresponding acetylated metabolites were detected with the highest frequencies of detection and at the highest concentrations. The ecotoxicity of both SPY and AcSPY was evaluated for the first time through bioluminescent inhibition assays, resulting in a higher toxicity being attributed to the metabolite. Finally, the potential environmental risk posed by the levels of SAs detected was evaluated calculating the hazard quotients (HQ) to different non-target aquatic organisms in treated wastewaters. SMX was the only SA posing a risk to algae, with an HQ > 10. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment is used by 20% of residences in the United States. The ability of these systems, specifically soil treatment units (STUs), to attenuate trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) is not well understood. TOrCs released by STUs pose a potential risk to downstream groundwater and hydraulically-connected surface water that may be used as a drinking water source. A series of bench-scale experiments were conducted using sand columns to represent STUs and to evaluate the efficacy of TOrC attenuation as a function of hydraulic loading rate (1, 4, 8, 12, and 30 cm/day). Each hydraulic loading rate was examined using triplicate experimental columns. Columns were initially seeded with raw wastewater to establish a microbial community, after which they were fed with synthetic wastewater and spiked with 17 TOrCs, in four equal doses per day, to provide a consistent influent water quality. After an initial start-up phase, effluent from all columns consistently demonstrated >90% reductions in dissolved organic carbon and nearly complete (>85%) oxidation of ammonia to nitrate, comparable to the performance of field STUs. The results of this study suggest STUs are capable of attenuating many TOrCs present in domestic wastewater, but attenuation is compound-specific. A subset of TOrCs exhibited an inverse relationship with hydraulic loading rate and attenuation efficiency. Atenolol, cimetidine, and TCPP were more effectively attenuated over time in each experiment, suggesting that the microbial community evolved to a stage where these TOrCs were more effectively biotransformed. Aerobic conditions as compared to anaerobic conditions resulted in more efficient attenuation of acetaminophen and cimetidine. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most conventional biological treatment wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contain nitrate in the effluent. Nitrate undergoes photolysis when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the 200-240 and 300-325 nm wavelength range. In the process of nitrate photolysis, nitrite and hydroxyl radicals are produced. Medium pressure mercury lamps emitting a polychromatic UV spectrum including irradiation below 240 nm are becoming more common for wastewater disinfection. Therefore, nitrified effluent irradiated with polychromatic UV could effectively become a de facto advanced oxidation (hydroxyl radical) treatment process. UV-based advanced oxidation processes commonly rely on addition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of UV irradiation for production of hydroxyl radicals. This study compares the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl radicals produced by nitrate contained in a conventional WWTP effluent to that produced by typical concentrations of hydrogen peroxide used for advanced oxidation treatment of water. The quantum yield of hydroxyl radical production from nitrate by all pathways was calculated to be 0.24 +/- 0.03, and the quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals from nitrite was calculated to be 0.65 +/- 0.06. A model was developed that would estimate production of hydroxyl radicals directly from nitrate and water quality parameters. In effluents with >5 mg-N/L of nitrate, the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is comparable to that produced by addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2. Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants utilizing polychromatic UV systems at disinfection dose levels can be expected to achieve up to 30% degradation of some micropollutants by hydroxyl radical oxidation. Increasing UV fluence to levels used during advanced oxidation could achieve over 95% degradation of some compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The photo-Fenton degradation of paracetamol (PCT) was evaluated using FeSO4 and the iron complex potassium ferrioxalate (FeOx) as iron source under simulated solar light. The efficiency of the degradation process was evaluated considering the decay of PCT and total organic carbon concentration and the generation of carboxylic acids, ammonium and nitrate, expressed as total nitrogen. The results showed that the degradation was favored in the presence of FeSO4 in relation to FeOx. The higher concentration of hydroxylated intermediates generated in the presence of FeSO4 in relation to FeOx probably enhanced the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) improving the degradation efficiency. The degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although at different concentrations, the same intermediates were generated using either FeSO4 or FeOx, which were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions and acetamide. The toxicity of the sample for Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna decreased from 100% to less than 40% during photo-Fenton treatment in the presence of both iron species, except for D. magna in the presence of FeOx due to the toxicity of oxalate to this organism. The considerable decrease of the sample toxicity during photo-Fenton treatment using FeSO4 indicates a safe application of the process for the removal of this pharmaceutical. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High biodegradation efficiencies of different emerging micropollutants were obtained with nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) working at high nitrogen loading rates (NLR), that boosted the development of biomass with high nitrifying activities (>1 g N-NH4+/g VSS d). Come-tabolic biodegradation seemed to be responsible for the removal of most compounds due to the action of the ammonium monooxygenase enzyme. NAS showed a different affinity for each compound, probably due to steric hindrance, activation energy limitations or the presence of specific functional groups. Increasing loading rates of micropollutants were removed at shorter hydraulic retention times, although the biodegradation efficiencies of compounds with slow/intermediate kinetics, such as fluoxetine, erythromycin, roxithromycin and trimethoprim, diminished due to kinetic and/or stoichiometric limitations. Solids retention time, always above the minimum to avoid the washout of nitrifiers, did not enhance the biodegradation of any of the selected compounds, with the exception of diclofenac. Regarding sorption, the solid liquid distribution coefficients (K-d) obtained in NAS were very similar to those found in conventional activated sludge by other authors. No correlation between K-d values and any of the operational parameters was found for the selected substances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An advanced ozone membrane reactor that uses membranes for ozone distribution, reaction contact and selective water separation was used for ozone treatment of a recalcitrant endocrine disrupting compound in water. Experiments and model calculation were employed to examine the ozonation of phthalate in the new reactor. Experimental results showed that fast ozone mass transfer rate is responsible for membrane reactor's superb performance compared with a semibatch reactor. Selective water removal further enhanced phthalate conversion and TOC removal by concentrating the pollutants in the reaction zone. Clean water was produced by membrane separation. Mathematical model was used to investigate the effect of membranes, reactor design and reaction operation on pollutant conversion and removal. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work was to identify relevant wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) parameters and underlying microbial processes that influence the biotransformation of a diverse set of micropollutants. To do this, we determined biotransformation rate constants for ten organic micropollutants in batch reactors seeded with activated sludge from ten diverse WWTPs. The estimated biotransformation rate constants for each compound ranged between one and four orders of magnitude among the ten WWTPs. The biotransformation rate constants were tested for statistical associations with various WWTP process parameters, amoA transcript abundance, and acetylene-inhibited monooxygenase activity. We determined that (i) ammonia removal associates with oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; (ii) archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts associate with both ammonia removal and oxidative rnicropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; and (iii) the activity of acetylene-inhibited monooxygenases (including ammonia monooxygenase) associates with ammonia removal and the biotransformation rate of isoproturon, but does not associate with all oxidative micropollutant biotransformations. In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that ammonia removal and amoA transcript abundance can potentially be predictors of oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reactions, but that the biochemical mechanism is not necessarily linked to ammonia monooxygenase activity.

AB The pharmaceutical wastewater was treated by coupling solar photo-Fenton process with an aerobic sequential batch reactor (SBR). Pharmaceutical wastewater has high COD and very low BOD and hence it is difficult to treat them biologically. The main purpose is to determine optimal photo-Fenton conditions (i.e., pH, ferrous ion concentration, H2O2 dosage and treatment time) for making wastewater biocompatible and suitable for subsequent biological treatment. Solar photo-Fenton process enhances biodegradability and a significant enhancement of biodegradability was found at the optimum conditions of pH = 3, H2O2 = 5 g L-1, Fe2+ = 1 g L-1 and irradiation time = 60 min. At this condition BOD3/COD ratio increased from 0.015 to 0.54. The coupled solar photo-Fenton with SBR process obtained COD removal of 98% and the effluent COD concentration was found to be 100 mg/L, which meets the requirements of the discharge standard.

AB The present work describes dynamic uptake of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CH), by using a cost-effective agricultural by-product - sawdust (SD). The sawdust was characterised by FTIR and SEM analysis. The sorbent particles were highly porous with average pore diameter of nearly 10 mu m. The optimum pH and solid/liquid ratio for sorption of CH were found to be 5.8 and 2.0, respectively. The dynamic drug uptake data was applied to various kinetic models and their order of fitness was found to be pseudo second order > Elovich equation > power function model, as indicated by their regression values. The experimental equilibrium uptake values (q(e)) were in close agreement with those evaluated from the pseudo second order equation for initial sorbate concentrations of 10 and 20 mg.l(-1) at 33 degrees C. The drug uptake mechanism was found to be attractive non-electrostatic interactions, involving H-bonding interactions between H atoms and other electro-negative species such as F, O and N of the drug molecule. The mechanism is discussed on the basis of pH(pzc) of sawdust and zwitterionic nature of drug CH. Mass transfer analysis was carried out using the drug uptake data obtained with sorbate concentrations of 10 and 20 mg.l(-1). The used sorbent could be regenerated using 1.0 mol.l(-1) HCl solution with a regeneration efficiency of nearly 85%.

AB A review of the literature published in 2011 on topics related to activated sludge and other aerobic suspended growth processes is presented. The review encompasses modeling, nutrient removal, system design and operation, oxygen transfer and solids separation. Two topics that have seen an increase in activity compared to historical reviews are membrane bioreactors and fate and occurrence of hormones and pharmaceuticals, which are referred to as microconstituents following current WEF terminology. Microconstituents as they relate to suspended growth reactors are covered in this review, while membrane bioreactors are reviewed in another section in this journal. Other subsections from the Treatment Systems section that might also be related to this section include: Wastewater Collection Systems; Biological Fixed Film Systems; and Modeling, Instrumentation, Automation, and Optimization of Wastewater Treatment Facilities.
   Many of the subsections in the Industrial Wastes, Hazardous Wastes, and Fate and Effects of Pollutants sections could also have some overlap with this section.

AB This review covers selected 2011 articles on the biological, chemical and physical effects of natural and anthropogenic pollutants on marine and estuarine plants and animals. The review, based largely on journal articles, covers field and laboratory measurement activities (concentrations of contaminants, field surveys, toxicity testing and biomarkers). Reviewed papers focus further on pollution issues of current interest including endocrine disrupters, wastewater discharges, dredging and disposal, etc. Special emphasis is placed on oil spills and marine debris due in part to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon blowout in the Gulf of Mexico and ongoing cleanup and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Several topical areas reviewed in the past were dropped this year due to circumstances beyond our control. Further, the focus is on effects, not pollutant fate and transport. There is considerable overlap across subject areas (e. g. some bioaccumulation papers may be cited in other topical categories). as always, readers should only use this as a guide and must consult the original papers before citing them, including double-checking units.

AB Soil column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of effluent organic matter (EfOM) characteristics on the removal of bulk organic matter (OM) and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR) treatment processes. The fate of bulk OM and PhACs during an MAR is important to assess post-treatment requirements. Biodegradable OM from EfOM, originating from biological wastewater treatment, was effectively removed during soil passage. Based on a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (F-EEM) analysis of wastewater effluent-dominated (WWE-dom) surface water (SW), protein-like substances, i.e., biopolymers, were removed more favorably than fluorescent humic-like substances under oxic compared to anoxic conditions. However, there was no preferential removal of biopolymers or humic substances, determined as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) observed via liquid chromatography with online organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analysis. Most of the selected PhACs exhibited removal efficiencies of greater than 90% in both SW and WWE-dom SW. However, the removal efficiencies of bezafibrate, diclofenac and gemfibrozil were relatively low in WWE-dom SW, which contained more biodegradable OM than did SW (copiotrophic metabolism). Based on this study, low biodegradable fractions such as humic substances in MR may have enhanced the degradation of diclofenac, gemfibrozil and bezafibrate by inducing an oligotrophic microbial community via long term starvation. Both carbamazepine and clofibric acid showed persistent behaviors and were not influenced by EfOM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Sulfamethoxazole (SMX, used as a model bacteriostatic antibiotic) is persistent to conventional biological treatments of wastewaters. In this work, conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO) was found to be an effective technology for its removal from the effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants. RESULTS: The use of CDEO has been evaluated for the removal of the antibiotic SMX from water and wastewaters. The results show that CDEO can reduce the concentration of this organic pollutant to values below 0.1 mu g dm-3. The variation of the SMX concentration during electrolysis shows a complex shape with a plateau zone that increases in size with the initial concentration of SMX. This complex trend is not observed in the changes of TOC, which seems to indicate that the CDEO of SMX solutions does not lead directly to the generation of carbon dioxide as a final product. A tentative reaction pathway has been proposed based on a thorough analysis of the reaction mixture, in which the main intermediate products were identified. The use of liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) allowed the identification of nine organic intermediates (with Mw 98, 108, 172, 173, 197, 203, 227, 269 and 287) during the electrolysis and the concentration of these compounds depends on the initial SMX concentration and on the current density applied. CONCLUSIONS: CDEO is able to reduce the concentration of the organic pollutant below 0.1 mg dm-3. SMX removal is faster than that of TOC. This fact indicates the formation of reaction intermediates. Analytical techniques show that nine reaction intermediates are generated in the system, and that their concentration depends on the initial SMX concentration and on the current density used.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) and nanofiltration (NF) hybrid system was investigated to demonstrate the performance of treating nitrogen, phosphorus and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater. With the MBR and NF (molecular weight cut off (MWCO): 210 Da), the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) was effectively reduced by nitrification by MBR and negatively charged surface of NF (TN: 8.67 mgN/L and TP: 0.46 mgP/L). Biosorption and microbial decomposition in MBR seem to be major removal mechanisms for the removal of PPCPs. Among various parameters affecting the removal of PPCPs by NF, namely, physicochemical properties of the PPCPs (charge characteristics, hydrophobicity and M-W) and membranes (MWCO and surface charge), the MWCO effect was found to be the most critical aspect.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of improving the quality and reducing the quantity of wastewater used to irrigate alfalfa. These effects were measured in terms of vegetative matter production and composition, and soil and leachate quality. The Tula Valley, which has been irrigated with wastewater from Mexico City for over 100 years, was used as a focus for the investigations.
   Greenhouse experiments were conducted using columns of soil and a crop of alfalfa. Two different water qualities were compared under three irrigation rates.
   It was found that with the current wastewater quality in the Tula Valley. it may be possible to reduce the application rate by 43% without negatively affecting crop nutrition. This would achieve a reduction in leachate organic matter by 35%, and leachate salts (Na, K) by 40%. After construction of the new treatment plant is completed, an intermediate irrigation rate would reduce leaching to the aquifer of organic matter by 45%, and salts (Na) by 25%, without affecting the productivity and quality of alfalfa, or the retention of nutrients and organic matter in the soil. The results of this exploratory study need to be confirmed and expanded on by land parcel trials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) mesophilic reactor was used to remove antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater. The hydraulic retention time was held constant at 13.3 days. The volumetric organic loading value increased from 0.33 to 7.43 kg(COD) m(-3) d(-1) using antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater gradually diluted with various ratios of domestic wastewater. A COD removal efficiency of 95.7% was obtained with a maximum yield of 3,700 L d(-1) methane gas production. The results of the study were interpreted using the modified Stover-Kincannon, first-order, substrate mass balance and Van der Meer and Heertjes kinetic models. The obtained kinetic coefficients showed that antibiotic fermentation broth wastewater can be successfully treated using a UASB reactor while taking COD removal and methane production into account.

AB An enormous quantity of pharmacologically active principles are currently being introduced into the environment, with consequent escalation of environmental problems, but only a small number of studies are focusing on an assessment of their genotoxic effects. The aim of this article is to assess the genotoxic effects of erythromycin, lincomycin, and of a combination of these two antibiotics on the genome of the zebrafish. The genotoxicity of the two antibiotics was assessed by applying the micronucleus test to erythrocytes and performing a Comet assay on erythrocytes and hepatocytes. The fish were exposed to antibiotics at different concentrations and times of exposure, under standard laboratory conditions. Depending on the different experimental conditions, erythromycin and lincomycin induced a significant increase in DNA migration (tail moment) and a significant increase in micronuleus frequency. We also conducted an analysis on the activation of repair mechanisms when the genotoxic agent was removed. Only a few of the cells displayed a decrease in damage under these test conditions.(c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 2012.

AB Antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are contaminants of the environment because of their widespread use and incomplete removal by microorganisms during wastewater treatment. The influence of a mixture of ciprofloxacin (CIP), gentamicin (GM), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)/trimethoprim (TMP), and vancomycin (VA), up to a final concentration of 40 mg/L, on the elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrification, and survival of bacteria, as well as the elimination of the antibiotics, was assessed in a long-term study in laboratory treatment plants (LTPs). In the presence of 30 mg/L antibiotics, nitrification of artificial sewage by activated sludge ended at nitrite. Nitrate formation was almost completely inhibited. No nitrification at all was possible in the presence of 40 mg/L antibiotics. The nitrifiers were more sensitive to antibiotics than heterotrophic bacteria. COD elimination in antibiotic-stressed LTPs was not influenced by a parts per thousand currency sign20 mg/L antibiotics. Addition of 30 mg/L antibiotic mixture decreased COD removal efficiency for a period, but the LTPs recovered. Similar results were obtained with 40 mg/L antibiotic mixture. The total viable count of bacteria was not affected negatively by the antibiotics. It ranged from 2.2 x 10(6) to 8.2 x 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) compared with the control at 1.4 x 10(6)-6.3 x 10(6) CFU/mL. Elimination of the four antibiotics during phases of 2.4-30 mg/L from the liquid was high for GM (70-90 %), much lower for VA, TMP, and CIP (0-50 %), and highly fluctuating for SMZ (0-95 %). The antibiotics were mainly adsorbed to the sludge and not biodegraded.

AB A pilot-scale integrated membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system, consisted of hydrolysis/acidification pretreatment. MABR process and activated carbon adsorption post-processing, was designed to treat the high-loading mixed pharmaceutical wastewater. A study of MABR process was conducted to investigate the effect of aeration condition, circulation flow rate and water quality on performance over 260 days. The performances of these processes were evaluated by the removal efficiency of COD, BOD5, turbidity, NH4+-N and TN. MABR process could effectively remove above 90% of COD and 98% of ammonia. The capacities per unit volume of MABR could reach up to 1311 gCOD/m(3)d and 48.2 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(3)d with single membrane aeration, and the oxygen utilization rate could be as high as 45%. After post-processing, the effluent of integrated treatment MABR system kept stable with COD below 200 mg/L and NH4+-N below 3 mg/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the potential for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals to accumulate in the tissues of biota is a topic of increasing importance in the pharmaceutical risk assessment process. However, few data are available in the literature that compare the ability of laboratory bioconcentration studies to predict field tissue concentrations. To begin to address this data gap, bioconcentration factors (BCF) for carbamazepine (CBZ), a human anticonvulsant that modulates Na+ channels, were determined using laboratory experiments with Pimephales notatus and Ictalurus punctatus. These data were compared to field derived bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for Oreochromis niloticus from the Denton, Texas Wastewater Treatment Plant. The 42 d kinetic BCFs (BCFk) for white muscle and liver of P. notatus were 1.9 and 4.6, respectively, while the white muscle, liver, brain, and plasma BCFk's of I. punctatus were 1.8, 1.5, 1.6, and 7.1, respectively. Field derived BAF values (2.5-3.8) for O. niloticus were similar to those derived in laboratory studies. Partitioning values between blood plasma and individual tissues were calculated for I. punctatus and O. niloticus, with the values indicating that tissue levels of carbamazepine are similar or slightly higher than plasma concentrations. Collectively these data suggest that the fish laboratory BCF and field derived BCF/BAF values for carbamazepine are similar and much lower than the European Union regulatory threshold of 2000 for designation of a "B" substance.

AB Metformin, an antidiabetic drug with one of the highest consumption rates of all pharmaceuticals worldwide, is biologically degraded to guanylurea in wastewater treatment plants. Due to high metformin influent concentrations of up to 100 mu g/L and its high but incomplete degradation both compounds are released in considerable amounts of up to several tens of mu g/L into recipient rivers. This is the first systematic study on their environmental fate and the effectiveness of treatment techniques applied in waterworks to remove metformin and guanylurea from surface water influenced raw waters. The concentrations in surface waters depend strongly on the respective wastewater burden of rivers and creeks and are typically in the range of about 1 mu g/L for metformin and several mu g/L for guanylurea but can reach elevated average concentrations of more than 3 and 20 mu g/L, respectively. Treatment techniques applied in waterworks were investigated by an extended monitoring program in three facilities and accompanied by laboratory-scale batch tests. Flocculation and activated carbon filtration proved to be ineffective for removal of metformin and guanylurea. During zonation and chlorination experiments with waterworks-relevant ozone and chlorine doses they were partly transformed to yet unknown compounds. The effectiveness of the treatment steps under investigation can be ordered chlorination > zonation > activated carbon filtration > flocculation. However, most effective for removal of both compounds at the three full-scale waterworks studied proved to be an underground passage (riverbank filtration or artificial groundwater recharge). A biological degradation is most likely as sorption can be neglected. This is based on laboratory batch tests conducted with three different soil materials according to OECD guideline 106. Since such treatment steps were implemented in all three drinking water treatment plants, even traces of metformin and its metabolite guanylurea could not be detected at the end of the treatment trains. Both can only be expected in finished drinking water if surface influenced raw water is used by direct abstraction without underground passage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of chemicals in sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of concern for human health and the environment. Legislations and regulations are put in place to minimize the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and arable land, e.g. via application of sewage sludge. Temporal trends analysis of sludge contaminants can be used to assess the effectiveness of such actions. Such analyses can be performed retrospectively, using sludge stored in environmental specimen banks, to investigate new or emerging environmental contaminants. The present study provides data from time-trend analyses of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other organic compounds in sludge from Swedish. The analysis showed that sludge is a suitable matrix for time-trend studies and it can take on average 12 years (range, 5-26 years) to track an annual change of +/- 10% (with a power of 80%). Statistically significant trends were found for 18 out of the 77 compounds subjected to analysis, of which 75% showed decreasing trends. Triclosan and the antibiotic norfloxacin followed the same trend as the national recorded usage and decreased annually by 65% and 60%, respectively. The opposite was true for the methylsiloxanes, which showed an annual average increase of about 30%. A downward trend (about 20% year(-1)) was observed for the polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs 154 and 183), while PBDE 209 increased by 16%. Further measurements are required to determine if the substitution of PBDEs by chlorinated paraffins or organophosphorus compounds have resulted in increased concentrations of the latter in sludge.

AB In the present study, archived U.S biosolids from the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Sewage Sludge Survey were analyzed with an expanded U.S EPA Method 1694, to determine the occurrence of 26 previously unmonitored pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) among a total of 120 analytes. The study further served to examine the reproducibility of a mega-composite approach for creating chemical mass inventories in biosolids based on pooled samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) nationwide. Five mega-composites reflecting 94 WWTPs in 32 states and the District of Columbia were constructed from archived biosolids and analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS using a newly introduced analytical method expanding upon U.S EPA Method 1694. In addition, soil-biosolids mixtures from a mesocosm setup were analyzed to experimentally determine the half-lives of biosolids-borne compounds applied on U.S land. Among 59 analytes detected, 33 had been reported previously, whereas 26 are reported in biosolids for the first time, at levels ranging from 1.65 to 673 mu g kg(-1) dry weight. Newly recognized biosolids constituents were identified as Ca2+ channel blockers, antidepressants, diuretics, beta-blockers and analgesics. Using a mass balance approach, the total loading of these 26 pharmaceuticals to U.S soils from biosolids land application was estimated at 5-15 tons year(-1). Past and present datasets for 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were determined to be statistically indistinguishable (paired t-test; p = 0.01). This study expands the list of PPCPs reported in U.S biosolids, provides the first estimates of nationwide release rates to and environmental half-lives in U.S agricultural soils, and confirms the utility of using mega-composite sampling for economical tracking of chemical inventories in biosolids on a national scale.

AB The separate and combined in vitro toxic effects of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazole and trimethoprim) commonly found in urban wastewater effluents were assessed on the immune parameters of Elliptio complanata at environmentally relevant concentrations. The observed responses were then compared to those produced by the physicochemical-treated wastewater effluent of a major city before and after the removal of microorganisms. Most of the selected antibiotics, separately and as mixture, induced changes in immune responses. The removal of microorganisms and fine particles from the effluent increased or decreased the resulting immunotoxic effects, depending of the observed parameter. The immunotoxic effects of erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were closely associated to the antibiotic mixture and the filtered effluent. In conclusion, the data revealed that the removal of fine particles and microorganisms from municipal effluents can alter the toxic nature of the effluent that is closely associated with the cumulative effects of antibiotics.

AB Conventional wastewater treatments are inefficient in the removal of many organic pollutants. The presence of these contaminants in the final sludge represents a source of environmental pollution due to the increasing use of biosolids in land application. A biotechnological approach which employed the fungus Trametes versicolor in a sludge-bioslurry reactor was assessed in order to remove several groups of emerging pollutants. Biological fungal activity was monitored by means of ergosterol and laccase determinations. Fifteen out of 24 detected pharmaceuticals were removed at efficiencies over 50% after the treatment, including eight completely degraded. Removal ranged between 16-53% and 22-100% for the brominated flame retardants and the UV-filters, respectively. Only two of all the detected compounds remained unchanged after the treatment. Although elimination results are promising, the toxicity of the final sludge increased after the treatment. This finding is contrary to the toxicity results obtained in similar treatments of sludge with T. versicolor in solid-phase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Irrigation with wastewater releases pharmaceuticals, pathogenic bacteria, and resistance genes, but little is known about the accumulation of these contaminants in the environment when wastewater is applied for decades. We sampled a chronosequence of soils that were variously irrigated with wastewater from zero up to 100 years in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico, and investigated the accumulation of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, carbamazepine, bezafibrate, naproxen, diclofenac, as well as the occurrence of Enterococcus spp., and sul and qnr resistance genes. Total concentrations of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine increased with irrigation duration reaching 95% of their upper limit of 1.4 mu g/kg (ciprofloxacin), 4.3 mu g/kg (sulfamethoxazole), and 5.4 mu g/kg (carbamazepine) in soils irrigated for 19-28 years. Accumulation was soil-type-specific, with largest accumulation rates in Leptosols and no time-trend in Vertisols. Acidic pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, naproxen, bezafibrate) were not retained and thus did not accumulate in soils. We did not detect qnrA genes, but qnrS and qnrB genes were found in two of the irrigated soils. Relative concentrations of sul1 genes in irrigated soils were two orders of magnitude larger (3.15x10(-3)+/- 0.22x10(-3) copies/16S rDNA) than in non-irrigated soils (4.35x10(-5)+/- 1.00x10(-5) copies/16S rDNA), while those of sul2 exceeded the ones in nonirrigated soils still by a factor of 22 (6.61x10(-4)+/- 0.59x10(-4) versus 2.99x10(-5)+/- 0.26x10(-5) copies/16S rDNA). Absolute numbers of sul genes continued to increase with prolonging irrigation together with Enterococcus spp. 23S rDNA and total 16S rDNA contents. Increasing total concentrations of antibiotics in soil are not accompanied by increasing relative abundances of resistance genes. Nevertheless, wastewater irrigation enlarges the absolute concentration of resistance genes in soils due to a long-term increase in total microbial biomass.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the degradation of sulfonamides (SNs) in real wastewater samples using photocatalytic processes performed in the presence of a commercial TiO2 catalyst (Degussa Aeroxide P25), FeCl3 and a TiO2/FeCl3 mixture. The dynamics of the photodegradation of a mixture containing sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole in distilled water and in synthetic, municipal (raw and after treatment) wastewater, in wastewater from septic tank and in landfill leachate were compared during the study. The changes in the antimicrobial activity of the samples containing SNs and the photodegradation products were also assessed using the MARA (R) test.
   It was observed that the photocatalytic degradation rate of SNs was primarily dependent on the environmental pollution degree, the catalytic system composition and pH values. In a landfill leachate the SNs photodegradation practically did not proceed. The inhibitors of the process were primarily soluble wastewater components.
   The decomposition products of the SNs did not cause an increase in the antimicrobial activity of the reaction medium. The highest effectiveness for the photodegradation of SNs was obtained using the mixture containing TiO2 (similar to 0.5 g l(-1)) and FeCl3 (similar to 0.5 mmol l(-1)) at pH similar to 3.0. The activity of this catalyst system estimated based on the half-life values of the SNs in the investigated samples were approximately 4.5 times greater than that in the presence of TiO2 alone. Its high activity at pH similar to 3 primarily resulted from the decrease in the dissociation degree of other wastewater components in acidic medium, rather than the synergism of both photocatalyst components.

AB Endocrine-disruptive potential and concentrations of polar organic contaminants were measured in seven headwaters flowing through relatively unpolluted areas of the Czech Republic. Towns with Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) discharges were the first known sources of anthropogenic pollution in the areas. River water was sampled several kilometers upstream (US) and several tens of meters downstream (DS) of the WWTP discharges, by use of Pesticide and Pharmaceutical Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS-Pest, POCIS-Pharm). Extracts of passive samplers were tested by use of a battery of in vitro bioassays to determine overall non-specific cytotoxicity, endocrine-disruptive (ED) potential and dioxin-like toxicity. The extracts were also used for quantification of polar organics. There was little toxicity to cells caused by most extracts of POCIS. Estrogenicity was detected in all types of samples even though US locations are considered to be background. At US locations, concentrations of estrogen equivalents (EEq) ranged from less than the detection limits (LOD) to 0.5 ng EEq/POCIS. Downstream concentrations of EEqs ranged from less than LOD to 4.8 ng EEq/POCIS. Concentrations of EEq in POCIS extracts from all DS locations were 1 to 14 times greater than those at US locations. Concentrations of EEq measured in extracts of POCIS-Pest and POCIS-Pharm were in a good agreement. Neither antiestrogenic nor anti/androgenic activities were detected. Concentrations of 2.3.7.8-TCDD equivalents (TEq(bio)) were detected in both types of POCIS at Concentrations ranging from less than the LOD to 0.39 ng TEq(bio)/POCIS. Nearly all extracts of POCIS-Pharm contained greater concentrations of TEq(bio) activity than extracts of POCIS-Pest. Concentrations of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in extracts of POCIS were generally small at all sampling sites, but levels of some pharmaceuticals were significantly greater in both types of POCIS from DS locations. Chemical analyses along with the results of bioassays documented impacts of small towns with WWTPs on headwaters. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Consumption-based approach for assessing the contribution of hospitals

AB Hospitals are considered as major sources of pharmaceutical residues discharged to municipal wastewater, but recent experimental studies showed that the contribution of hospitals to the loads of selected, quantifiable pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plant (STP) influents was limited. However such conclusions are made based on the experimental analysis of pharmaceuticals in hospital wastewater which is hindered by a number of factors such as access to suitable sampling sites, difficulties in obtaining representative samples and availability of analytical methods. Therefore, this study explores a refined and extended consumption-based approach to predict the contribution of six selected Australian hospitals to the loads of 589 pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater. In addition, the possibility that hospital-specific substances are present at levels that may pose a risk for human health was evaluated. For 63 to 84% of the pharmaceuticals investigated, the selected hospitals are not a major point source with individual contributions likely to be less than 15% which is in line with previous experimental studies. In contrast, between 10 and 20% of the pharmaceuticals consumed in the selected hospitals are exclusively used in these hospitals. For these hospital-specific substances, 57 distinct pharmaceuticals may cause concerns for human health as concentrations predicted in hospital effluents are less than 100-fold lower than effect thresholds. However, when concentrations were predicted in the influent of the corresponding STP, only 12 compounds (including the antineoplastic vincristine, the antibiotics tazobactam and piperacillin) remain in concentration close to effect thresholds, but further decrease is expected after removal in STP, dilution in the receiving stream and drinking water treatment. The results of this study suggest that risks of human exposure to the pharmaceuticals exclusively administered in the investigated hospitals are limited and decentralised wastewater treatment at these sites would not have a substantial impact on pharmaceutical loads entering STPs, and finally the environment. Overall, our approach demonstrates a unique opportunity to screen for pharmaceuticals used in hospitals and identifying priority pollutants in hospital wastewater explicitly accounting for site-specific conditions. Being based on consumption and loads discharged by hospitals into municipal wastewater, it is not limited by 1) the big effort to obtain representative samples from sewers, 2) the availability of sensitive chemical analysis or 3) a pre-selection of consumption data (e.g. consumption volume).

AB This study evaluates the potential application of tin porphyrin- and C-60 aminofullerene-derivatized silica (SnP/silica and aminoC(60)/silica) as O-1(2) generating systems for photochemical degradation of organic pollutants. Photosensitized O-1(2) production with SnP/silica, which was faster than with aminoC(60)/silica, effectively oxidized a variety of pharmaceuticals. Significant degradation of pharmaceuticals in the presence of the 400-nm UV cutoff filter corroborated visible light activation of both photosensitizers. Whereas the efficacy of aminoC(60)/silica for O-1(2) production drastically decreased under irradiation with lambda > 550 nm, Q-band absorption caused negligible loss of the photosensitizing activity of SnP/silica in the long wavelength region. Faster destruction of phenolates by SnP/silica and aminoC60/silica under alkaline pH conditions further implicated O-1(2) involvement in the oxidative degradation. Direct charge transfer mediated by SO, which was inferred from nanosecond laser flash photolysis, induced significant degradation of neutral phenols under high power light irradiation. Self-sensitized destruction caused gradual activity loss of SnP/silica in reuse tests unlike aminoC(60)/silica. The kinetic comparison of SnP/silica and TiO2 photocatalyst in real wastewater effluents showed that photosensitized singlet oxygenation of pharmaceuticals was still efficiently achieved in the presence of background organic matters, while significant interference was observed for photocatalyzed oxidation involving non-selective OH radical.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals lidocaine (LDC), tramadol (TRA) and venlafaxine (VEN), and their major active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), O-desmethyltramadol (ODT) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were studied at four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) equipped with activated sludge treatment technologies. In parallel to activated sludge treatment, the removal efficiency of the compounds in pilot- and full-scale projects installed at the WWTPs was investigated. Within these projects two different treatment methods were tested: adsorption onto powdered/granulated activated carbon (PAC/GAC) and ozonation. The metabolite MEGX was not detected in any sample. The concentrations of the target analytes in wastewater effluents resulting from activated sludge treatment ranged from 55 to 183 (LDC), 88 to 416 (TRA), 50 to 245 (ODT), 22 to 176 (VEN) and 77 to 520 ng L-1 (ODV). In the pilot project with subsequent treatment with PAC/GAC, the mean concentrations of the analytes were between <LOQs and 30 (LDC), 111 (TRA), 140 (ODT), 45 (VEN) and 270 ng L-1 (ODV). In the pilot project with subsequent ozonation of the effluent from the conventional treatment the mean concentrations were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) for all of the investigated compounds. The results showed limitations of activated sludge treatment technologies in removing the target compounds but highlighted both PAC/GAC adsorption and ozonation technologies as effective post-treatment processes for the elimination of the target compounds from wastewater in WWTPs. Possible oxidation by-products formed during ozonation were not analyzed.

AB In the modern pharmaceutical industry many flexible batch plants operate under an integrated business and production system, using ISA S95 and ISA S88 standards for models and terminology, and implementing flexible recipe-based production.
   In the environment of constantly changing market conditions, adjustment to surroundings is a business necessity. To support necessary production improvement, regulatory authorities have introduced the risk based approach for the control of process development, production based on the quality by design (QbD) principle, and process analytical technology (PAT).
   In this work, the method for practical implementation of an adaptable control recipe, that allows process improvement inside the previously established design space, is proposed, based on the neural network process model.
   Based on the neural network model, the three methods for recipe-controlled process improvement and optimization were introduced neural-based software sensor, generic neural model control, and process optimization using iterative dynamic programming.
   Suitability of the proposed method was tested in a mini reaction plant Chemreactor Buchi, running the wastewater treatment batch, controlled by the production recipe based on S88 standard.

AB The immobilization of active photo-Fenton heterogeneous catalysts over different materials, mainly polymers, has been studied in the literature to avoid their separation from the reaction solution. However, those materials exhibited a high preparation cost and low stability in the process, being difficult their application in an industrial wastewater treatment plant. In this work, a dip-coating method for the immobilization of goethite film on the wall of a photo-Fenton reactor was studied. The influence of the concentration of the initial goethite suspension as well as the withdrawal speed on the coating process, were evaluated. Both variables have shown to be critical in the homogeneity and the optical properties of the layer and therefore in its activity in the photo-assisted reaction.
   The immobilized photo-Fenton system was tested in the degradation of a mixture of six selected pharmaceutical compounds (nicotine, 4-acetamidoantipyrine, hydrochlorothiazide, ranitidine, diclofenac sodium and sulfamethoxazole) in aqueous solution. The influence of the goethite layer thickness in the photo-activity of the system was established and the results were compared with those obtained using goethite powder in a slurry photo-reactor. One coating cycle, corresponding to 0.05 g/L of catalyst was enough to obtain 100% degradation of the selected pharmaceutical compounds after 6 h of reaction using a low oxidant concentration, except for the nicotine, that seems to be refractory to the tested photo-Fenton system. The use of a commercial goethite as catalyst and the simplicity of the dip-coating procedure make this process an attractive alternative for the design of wastewater treatments based on the heterogeneous photo-Fenton reaction.

AB This preliminary study evaluated an assessment of the risks arising from environmental exposure to beta-blockers from wastewater of an university hospital (University Hospital of Santa Maria (HUSM), Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil). Propranolol showed the highest risk quotient (0.56). The occurrence of beta-blockers was evaluated using an analytical procedure SPE-HPLC-FLD (solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection), optimizing the variables sample pH, water pH, and methanol: acetonitrile: formic acid ratio of the elution stage. The average concentrations of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol for a sampling period of one week were 2.45 +/- 1.14, 4.67 +/- 1.63 and 0.70 +/- 0.88 mu g L-1 in the 'Emergence' sewage; 0.95 +/- 0.68, 0.70 +/- 0.33 and 0.315 +/- 0.62 mu g L-1 in the 'HUSM general' sewage and 1.26 +/- 0.47, 1.27 +/- 0.35 and 0.56 +/- 0.47 mu g L-1 in the 'Receiving waters', the receptor stream of the effluents, respectively. Propranolol showed an MEC/PNEC ratio > 1, and thus requires more attention in terms of toxicity. The occurrence of beta-blockers and the associated environmental risks demonstrate the need of a more efficient treatment system for the hospital wastewater.

AB The concentrations of several pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were simulated in the Grand River watershed using the PhATE (Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation) model. PPCPs that were previously measured in the Grand River watershed were selected as the target compounds for this study. The application of the PhATE model was adapted to account for Canadian climatic conditions and its seasonal variability. In this regard, seasonal hydrological parameters (i.e., stream flow and velocity) were estimated based on historical data. Chemical loss parameters, including in-stream decay, human loss, and removal efficiency of treatment plants, were initially extracted from the literature and then calibrated to the site data. In general, the adapted PhATE model reasonably simulated pharmaceuticals with continuous use by humans such as ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine, and gemfibrozil. Validation, which was performed only for ibuprofen, naproxen, and carbamazepine suggests that the calibrated model is able to reliably simulate concentrations. The model is the most accurate in validation when simulating carbamazepine which is the most persistent substance tested in this study, and as such, variations in its concentration primarily follow variation in stream flow.

AB In this study the occurrence of diclofenac and sub-products in effluent emerging from the University Hospital at the Federal University of Santa Maria was investigated. One metabolite was identified and, in aqueous solution, three degradation products. The quantification was conducted by means of HPLC-DAD, and the determination of metabolite and degradation products by LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap. For the HPLC-DAD method, a 70: 30 mixture of methanol/sodium phosphate was used in isocratic mode. For the LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap determinations, a mobile phase, where phase A was an ammonium acetate solution 5 x 10(-3) mol L-1, and phase B was methanol (5 x 10(-3) mol L-1)/ammonium acetate (9:1, v/v), on gradient mode. The LDs for the HPLC and LC-MS/MS methods, respectively, were 2.5 and 0.02 mu g L-1, the LQs, 8.3 and 0.05 mu g L-1, and the linear range from 10 up to 2000 mu g L-1 and 0.05 up to 10 mu g L-1. As expected, the LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap method was more sensitive and less laborious. The metabolite 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac was identified. Photolysis was used for the degradation studies and three products of diclofenac were identified (m/z of 214, 286 and 303) in aqueous solution. These results notwithstanding, no degradation products of diclofenac were found in the hospital effluent.

AB Simultaneous determination of endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs), namely diltiazem, progesterone, benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), estrone, and carbamazepine (Cbz) were performed by using high performance LC-electrospray tandem MS. The ultrasound-aided sequential extraction of sludge samples was optimized to increase extraction efficiencies of the analytes; ranging between 93.0-98.3% recovery. The limit of detection values for diltiazem, progesterone, BBP, estrone, and Cbz were found as 0.78, 0.72, 0.24, 0.75, and 0.72 mu g/kg, respectively. Sludge samples taken from Ankara Tatlar; Hurma, Lara and Kemer of Antalya, and Middle East Technical University-vacuum rotating membrane wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) aeration tanks were analyzed for their EDCs contents under optimized conditions. Diltiazem was found in all the samples in the range between 116.4-180.8 ng/g while progesterone and estrone were not detected in any of the samples analyzed with the exception of Tatlar WWTP. The BBP concentration was between beyond detection and 9195.5 ng/g. In addition, Cbz was found in all the samples ranging from 25.6 to 118.8 ng/g.

AB The reuse of treated wastewater for groundwater recharge is an effective way to provide advanced treatment and water storage. Contaminants such as human drugs have been identified as a potential problem for use of this water. Gilbert, Arizona maintains a 28.3-ha facility designed to recharge 15,150 m(3) d(-1) through recharge basins constructed on native soil. The facility averages an infiltration rate of > 5 cm d(-1), resulting in the potential of pharmaceutical compounds leaching to groundwater. One 4-ha basin was selected for spatial sampling of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). The compounds were carbamazepine, lincomycin, ibuprofen, and caffeine. Soils were extracted and analyzed using pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. The concentration of ibuprofen was below detection limits in all samples. Lincomycin exhibited no net accumulation from year to year but had significantly higher concentrations from depths of 0 to 5 cm than from depths > 10 cm. Carbamazepine had the lowest concentration at 0 to 5 cm (0.18 ng g soil(-1)), providing evidence that there is potential degradation of carbamazepine in surface soils. Carbamazepine also exhibited significant accumulation from year to year. Caffeine exhibited net accumulation and had higher concentrations in surface samples. The accumulation of PhACs in the soil beneath recharge basins indicates that PhACs are being removed from the infiltrating water and that, regarding ibuprofen and lincomycin, the treatment is sustainable due to the lack of accumulation. Regarding carbamazepine and caffeine, further investigations are needed to determine possible management and environmental conditions that could prevent accumulation.

AB Antimicrobial agent residues are becoming an intractable environmental problem in soil, surface, and underground water. To obtain a broad profile of residues in animal wastewater and surface water, 24 animal wastewater, 8 animal farm effluent, 18 river water, and 8 pond water samples taken in Jiangsu in eastern China were monitored for enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and florfenicol using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESIMS/MS) techniques. The results revealed that two antibacterials were detected simultaneously in 49.1% of samples, followed by three antibacterials (22.6%) and one antibacterial (22.6%). Up to 3.35, 5.93, and 2.10 mu g L-1 for ciprofloxacin, 1.09, 4.24, and 0.50 mu g L-1 for enrofloxacin, and 0.95, 2.40, and 2.84 mu g L-1 for florfenicol were detected in animal farm-effluent, river, and pond water, respectively. The maximum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in animal wastewaters were 7.49 and 8.77 mu g L-1, respectively. Furthermore, residue levels of ciprofloxacin and florfenicol showed at least two statistical differences between any two sampling areas or two animal farms. Enrofloxacin showed no statistical difference among the sampling areas and the animal farms.

AB This study presents findings on an assessment of the effect of continuous and batch feeding strategies on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals from synthetic wastewater. Six mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands, including three horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands and three sand filters, were set up at the campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The findings showed that ibuprofen and diclofenac removal in the wetlands was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in the batch versus continuous mode. In contrast, naproxen and carbamazepine showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in elimination under either feeding strategy. Our results also clearly showed that the presence of plants exerts a stimulatory effect on pharmaceutical removal for ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen in batch and continuous mode. Estimation of the quantitative role of this stimulatory effect on pharmaceutical elimination of batch operation as compared with the effect of the presence of the higher plant alone showed that batch operation may account for 40 to 87% of the contribution conferred by the aquatic plant. The findings of this study imply that where maximal removal of pharmaceutical compounds is desired, periodic draining and filling might be the preferred operational strategy for full-scale, subsurface flow constructed wetlands.

AB Land application of biosolids (treated sewage sludge) can be an important route for introducing xenobiotic compounds into terrestrial environments. There is a paucity of available information on the effects of biosolids amendment on terrestrial organisms. In this study, the influence of biosolids and biosolids aging on earthworm (Eisenia fetida) reproduction and survival and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seedling emergence was investigated. Earthworms were exposed to soils amended with varying quantities of biosolids (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4% dry mass). To investigate the influence of biosolids aging, the biosolids used in the study were aged for differing lengths of time (2 or 8 weeks) prior to exposure. All of the adult earthworms survived in the biosolids-amended soils at all concentrations that were aged for 2 weeks; however, only 20% of the adults survived in the soil amended with the highest concentration of biosolids and aged for 8 weeks. Reproduction as measured by mean number of juveniles and unhatched cocoons produced per treatment correlated inversely with biosolids concentration, although the effects were generally more pronounced in the 8-week aged biosolids-soil samples. latent seedling emergence and reduced seedling fitness correlated inversely with biosolids concentration, but these effects were tempered in the 8-week aged versus the 2-week aged soil-biosolids mixtures. Anthropogenic waste indicator compounds (AWIs) were measured in the biosolids, biosolids-soil mixtures, and earthworm samples. Where possible. bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated or estimated. A wide variety of AWIs were detected in the biosolids (51 AWIs) and earthworm samples (<= 19 AWI). The earthworms exposed to the 8-week aged biosolids-soil mixtures tended to accumulate greater quantities of AWIs compared to the 2-week aged mixture, suggesting that the bioavailability of some AWIs was enhanced with aging. The BAFs for a given AWI varied with treatment. Notably large BAFs were determined for some AWIs. For example, the maximum BAF determined for para-cresol, methyl salicylate, bisphenol-A. and cholesterol was greater than 100 in some treatments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Before analysis with GC-MS, deconjugation of estrogen conjugates with acid-catalyzed solvolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis is regarded as the indispensable procedure. However, in our study we found in the first time that estrogen sulfates (Estrone-3-sulfate, E1-3S; Estradiol-3-sulfate, E2-3S; Estriol-3-sulfate, E3-3S) could be directly analyzed with GC-MS, and the deconjugation procedure can be omitted. In the procedure, estrogen sulfates could be directly derivatized to their corresponding free estrogen derivatives, in which mixture solution of N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) plus 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was used as the derivatization reagent, and the derivatization conditions were determined at 80A degrees C for 90 min. Possible mechanism of the direct derivatization of estrogen sulfates by BSTFA plus 1% TMCS was suggested. This finding indicated a latent favorable analytical method of estrogen sulfates for environmental samples.

AB The influence of operation condition on the fate of 16 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in a single-sludge nitrifying/denitrifying pilot plant was assessed. Volatilisation, sorption and degradation were included in the mass balances to determine the most relevant removal mechanisms during PPCP treatment.
   Sludge retention time (SRT) was an important factor for the removal of compounds that significantly sorb onto sludge, as ethinylestradiol, whose removal increased 11% when working at SRT above 20 d. The internal recirculation ratio was significant for the removal of moderately biodegradable compounds, as citalopram. The positive effect of operating at warmer temperatures was particularly significant for two antibiotics, implying a 30% increase in their transformations. In the case of naproxen, an influence of sludge acclimation and concentration was observed, leading to removal efficiencies from 27% to 99%.
   Concerning removal mechanisms, most compounds were removed due to biotransformation, although for fragrances sorption and volatilisation played a role. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the trace-level contamination of pharmaceuticals in the water environment all over the world. Considering a large number of pharmaceuticals used, it is crucial to establish a priority list of pharmaceuticals that should be monitored and/or treated first. In the present study, we developed a ranking system based on the pharmaceutical consumption, removal performance in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and potential ecological effects, and applied to the situation of China. 39 pharmaceuticals, which had available consumption data and also been reported previously in the WWTPs of China, were selected as candidate pharmaceuticals. Among them, seventeen pharmaceuticals were considered as priority pharmaceuticals, out of which, erythromycin, diclofenac acid and ibuprofen, had the high priority. Compared with other literatures, we found that some pharmaceuticals given concerns to globally should also be included in the priority list in China: while some pharmaceuticals, not mentioned in other literatures, such as cefalexin, ketoconazole, should be also given prior consideration in China. Among all the therapeutic classes, antibiotics, which were grossly abused in China, contributed the most to the priority pharmaceuticals. However, priority antibiotics accounted for only 32% of candidate antibiotics, while 71% and 100% of the candidate anti-inflammatory and anti-lipidemic respectively were identified as the priority pharmaceuticals, indicating that antibiotics might be overanxiously considered in the previous studies on their behaviors in the WWTPs of China.

AB According to the high incidence of cancer worldwide, the amount of cytostatic drugs administered to patients has increased. These compounds are excreted to wastewaters, and therefore become potential water contaminants. At this stage, very little is known on the presence and elimination of cytostatic compounds in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The aim of this study was to develop a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS) method for the determination of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters. These compounds represent two outmost used cytostatic agents.
   Extraction and analytical conditions were optimized for cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewater. Both solid-phase extraction using Oasis 200 mg hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) cartridges and direct injection analysis were evaluated. Mass spectral characterization and fragmentation conditions were optimized at 50,000 resolving power (full width at half maximum, m/z 200) to obtain maximum sensitivity and identification performance. Quality parameters (recoveries, limits of detection, and repetitivity) of the methods developed were determined, and best performance was obtained with direct water analysis of the centrifuged wastewater. Finally, this method was applied to determine the presence of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters from a hospital effluent, an urban effluent, and influents and effluents from three WWTP.
   Cyclophosphamide and epirubicin were recovered after 50 mL preconcentration on solid-phase extraction 200 mg Oasis HLB cartridges (87% and 37%, respectively), and no breakthrough was observed by extracting 500 mL of water. Limits of detection were of 0.35 and 2.77 ng/L for cyclophosphamide and epirubicin, respectively. On the other hand, direct injection of water spiked at 1 mu g/L provided recoveries of 107% for cyclophosphamide and 44% for epirubicin and limits of detection from 3.1 to 85 ng L-1, respectively. The analysis of wastewaters using direct injection analysis revealed the presence of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in WWTP influents and hospital and urban effluents at levels ranging from 5.73 to 24.8 mu g L-1.
   The results obtained in this study demonstrate the capability of LC-Orbitrap-MS for accurate trace analysis of these very polar contaminants. This method permitted to identify cyclophosphamide and epirubicin in wastewaters and influents of WWTP, but no traces were detected in WWTP effluents. The methodology herein developed is sensitive and robust and applicable for screening of a large number of samples since no preconcentration is needed.

AB Many pharmaceuticals and related metabolites are not efficiently removed in sewage treatment plants and enter into surface water. There, they might be subject of drinking water abstraction and treatment by ozonation. In this study, a systematic approach for producing and effect-based testing of transformation products (TPs) during the drinking water ozonation process is proposed. For this, two pharmaceutical parent substances, three metabolites and one environmental degradation product were investigated with respect to their biodegradability and fate during drinking water ozonation. The Ames test (TA98, TA100) was used for the identification of mutagenic activity present in the solutions after testing inherent biodegradability and/or after ozonation of the samples. Suspicious results were complemented with the umu test. Due to the low substrate concentration required for ozonation, all ozonated samples were concentrated via solid phase extraction (SPE) before performing the Ames test. With the exception of piracetam, all substances were only incompletely biodegradable, suggesting the formation of stable TPs. Metformin, piracetam and guanylurea could not be removed completely by the ozonation process. We received some evidence that technical TPs are formed by ozonation of metformin and piracetam, whereas all tested metabolites were not detectable by analytical means after ozonation. In the case of guanylurea, one ozonation TP was identified by LC/MS. None of the experiments showed an increase of mutagenic effects in the Ames test. However, the SPE concentration procedure might lead to false-positive results due to the generation of mutagenic artefacts or might lead to false-negative results by missing adequate recovery efficiency. Thus, these investigations should always be accompanied by process blank controls that are carried out along the whole ozonation and SPE procedure. The study presented here is a first attempt to investigate the significance of transformation products by a systematic approach. However, the adequacy and sensitivity of the methodology need to be further investigated. The approach of combining biodegradation and ozonation with effect-based assays is a promising tool for the early detection of potential hazards from TPs as drinking water contaminants. It can support the strategy for the evaluation of substances and metabolites in drinking water. A multitude of possible factors which influence the results have to be carefully considered, among them the selectivity and sensibility of the mutagenicity test applied, the extraction method for concentrating the relevant compounds and the biocompatibility of the solvent. Therefore, the results have to be carefully interpreted, and possible false-negative and false-positive results should be considered.

AB Fluidized beds are used for a variety of processes such as food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and energy production. Supersonic gas injection nozzles are used to grind particles in fluidized beds. For example, in the Fluid Coking process, which uses thermal cracking reactions to upgrade heavy oil, supersonic nozzles inject steam to control coke particle size. Maintaining a high attrition rate with a lower steam flowrate would reduce energy consumption, increase reactor throughput. and reduce sour wastewater production. The purpose of the present research is to study particle attrition with supersonic convergent-divergent nozzles in a fluidized bed at high temperatures, under conditions such as those encountered in the Fluid Coking process. According to the experimental results, the grinding efficiency is significantly improved by increasing fluidized bed temperature, attrition gas properties, or nozzle size. The experimental data further suggest that particle fragmentation is the dominant attrition process when using supersonic nozzles in a hot fluidized bed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study we investigate the fate of citalopram (CIT) at neutral pH using advanced water treatment technologies that include O-3. ClO2 oxidation, UV irradiation and Fenton oxidation. The ozonation resulted in 80% reduction after 30 min treatment. Oxidation with ClO2 removed >90% CIT at a dosage of 0.1 mg L-1. During UV irradiation 85% reduction was achieved after 5 min, while Fenton with addition of 14 mg L-1 (Fe2+) resulted in 90% reduction of CIT. During these treatment experiments transformation products (TPs) were formed from CIT, where five compounds were identified by using high resolution and tandem mass spectrometry. Among these desmethyl-citalopram and citalopram N-oxide have been previously identified as human metabolites, while three are novel and published here for the first time. The three TPs are a hydroxylated dimethylamino-side chain derivative, a butyrolactone derivative and a defluorinated derivative of CIT. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of anthropogenic compounds that occur in aquatic ecosystems today is in the thousands, many at trace concentrations. One group of compounds that has captured the interest of both the scientific community and the general public is pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), for example, hormones, chemotherapy drugs, antihistamines, stimulants, antimicrobials and various cosmetic additives. Toxicology of some PPCPs is currently understood, but their effect on ecological structure and function of aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. We review sources and fates of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems and discuss how methods developed to study aquatic ecosystem ecology can contribute to our understanding of the influence of PPCPs on aquatic ecosystems. We argue that aquatic ecology has a well-developed tool kit for measuring the transformation, fate, and transport of solutes using assays and experiments and that these methods could be employed to investigate how PPCPs impact ecological function. We discuss the details of these approaches and conclude that application of existing ecological methods to the study of this issue could substantially improve our understanding of the effect of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems.

AB A set of human pharmaceuticals enables identification of groundwater that is influenced by sewage and provides information on the time of recharge. As the consumption rates of the investigated pharmaceuticals have changed over time, so too has the composition of the sewage. At the study area, south of Berlin (Germany), irrigation was performed as a method of wastewater clean-up at sewage irrigation farms until the early 1990s. Today, treated wastewater is discharged into the surface-water-stream Nuthegraben. Groundwater and surface-water samples were analyzed for the pharmaceutical substances clofibric acid, bezafibrate, diclofenac, carbamazepine and primidone, the main ions and organic carbon. The pharmaceutical substances were detected at concentrations up to microgram-per-liter level in groundwater and surface-water samples from the Nuthegraben Lowland area and from the former irrigation farms. Concentrations detected in groundwater are generally much lower than in surface water and there is significant variation in the distribution of pharmaceutical concentrations in groundwater. Groundwater influenced by the irrigation of sewage water shows higher primidone and clofibric-acid concentrations. Groundwater influenced by recent discharge of treated sewage water into the surface water shows high carbamazepine concentrations while concentrations of primidone and clofibric acid are low.

AB The emerging contaminants are commonly derived from municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastewater sources and pathways. These compounds are polar and poorly biodegradable. The dynamic removal of atenolol from aqueous solutions by activated carbon in fixed bed column systems was investigated. As far as we know, this is the first study reporting the decontamination by adsorption in fixed bed of solutions containing atenolol, as model compound of beta-blockers, which are pharmaceutical pollutants with a high occurrence in natural waters. The performance of fixed bed columns was described through the breakthrough curves obtained from column experiments. The Bohart-Adams, Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models were applied to predict different parameters of the column like service time (Bohart-Adams model), adsorption capacity (Thomas model) and time required for 50% breakthrough (Yoon-Nelson model). Also, the theoretical breakthrough adsorption curve has been obtained. For the last, an industrial scale adsorber was designed from characteristic parameters of the breakthrough curves obtained from experimental data.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) deserve attention because of their effect on ecosystems and human health, as well as their continuous introduction into the aquatic environment. Classification schemes are suggested to characterise their biological degradation, e.g., based on pseudo-first-order kinetics, but these schemes can vary significantly, presumably due to pharmaceutical loads, sludge characteristics and experimental conditions. Degradation data for PhAC transformation products (TPs) are largely lacking.
   The present work focuses not only on the biodegradation of the pharmaceutical compound ibuprofen but also on its best-known TPs (i.e., carboxyl ibuprofen and both hydroxyl ibuprofen isomers). Ibuprofen is one of the most commonly consumed PhACs and can be found in different environmental compartments.
   The experiment performed consisted of a set of aerated batch tests with different suspended solid and ibuprofen concentrations to determine the influence of these parameters on the calculated biodegradation constant (K-biol). Sampling of the liquid phase at different scheduled times was assessed, removal efficiencies were calculated and pseudo-first-order kinetics were adjusted to obtain experimental K-biol values for the parent compound and its TPs.
   The experimental data were successfully fitted to ASM-based models, with K-biol values for the target compounds ranging from almost 1 to 17 L gSST(-1) d(-1), depending on the concentrations of the biomass and ibuprofen. This work provides innovative knowledge not only regarding the removal of TPs but also the formation kinetics of these TPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and removal of 42 pharmaceuticals, belonging to different therapeutic groups (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-ulcer agent, psychiatric drugs, antiepileptic drug, antibiotics, beta-blockers, diuretics, lipid regulator and cholesterol lowering statin drugs and anti-histamines), were studied in the wastewater and sewage sludge trains of a full scale integrated treatment plant. The plant employs a biological nutrient removal (BNR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater, and a single-stage mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion for the treatment of wasted activated sludge mixed with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), followed by a short-cut nitrification-denitrification of the anaerobic supernatant in a sequential batch reactor. Influent and effluent wastewater, as well as thickened, digested and treated sludge were sampled and analyzed for the selected pharmaceuticals in order to study their presence and fate during the treatment. Twenty three compounds were detected in influent and effluent wastewater and eleven in sludge. Infiltration of groundwater in the sewer system led to a dilution of raw sewage, resulting in lower concentrations in wastewater (up to 0.7 mu g/L in influent) and sludge (70ng/g d.w.). Due to the dilution, overall risk quotient for the mixture of pharmaceuticals detected in effluent wastewater was less than one, indicating no direct risk for the aquatic environment A wide range of removal efficiencies during the treatment was observed, i.e. <20% to 90%. The influent concentrations of the target pharmaceuticals, as polar compounds, were undoubtedly mostly affected by BNR process in the wastewater train, and less by anaerobic-co-digestion. Mass balance calculations showed that less than 2% of the total mass load of the studied pharmaceuticals was removed by sorption. Experimentally estimated distribution coefficients (<500L/kg) also indicated that the selected pharmaceuticals preferably remain in the aqueous phase, and that biodegradation/transformation is the primary removal mechanism for these compounds during wastewater treatment.

AB Sewage sludge- and waste oil sludge-derived materials were tested as adsorbents of pharmaceuticals from diluted water solutions. Simultaneous retention of eleven antibiotics plus two anticonvulsants was examined via batch adsorption experiments. Virgin and exhausted adsorbents were examined via thermal and FTIR analyses to elucidate adsorption mechanisms. Maximum adsorption capacities for the 6 materials tested ranged from 80 to 300 mg/g, comparable to the adsorption capacities of antibiotics on various activated carbons (200-400 mg/g) reported in the literature. The performance was linked to surface reactivity, polarity and porosity. A large volume of pores similar in size to the adsorbate molecules with hydrophobic carbon-based origin of pore walls was indicated as an important factor promoting the separation process. Moreover, the polar surface of an inorganic phase in the adsorbents attracted the functional groups of target molecules. The presence of reactive alkali metals promoted reaction with acidic groups, formation of salts and their precipitation in the pore system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lake Tegel (Berlin, Germany) is controlled by two main inflows: inflow #1 (River Havel) is heavily phosphorus-laden, whereas inflow #2 is an artificial confluence that includes discharge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant distinguished by high levels of phosphorus and pharmaceuticals. To reduce the phosphorus load on the lake, a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP) is situated at inflow #2. Moreover, the two inflows are short-circuited by a pipeline that transfers part of the inflow #1 water to the PEP and finally releases it into inflow #2. The pipeline and the PEP have contributed to a continuous reduction in the total phosphorus concentration of Lake Tegel in the past 25 years. We investigate the question of whether the existing lake pipeline can also be used to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals in Lake Tegel originating from inflow #2 by dilution with water from River Havel, by diverting part of inflow #2 around the lake, or by a combination of both strategies. The circulation pattern of Lake Tegel is complicated by complex bathymetry and numerous islands and is therefore highly sensitive to winds. We tested seven different management scenarios by hydrodynamic modeling for a period of 16 years with the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). None of the scenarios provided a strategy optimal for both pharmaceuticals and phosphorus. Nonetheless, compound regimes, such as alternating the pipe flow direction or adding another pipeline, allowed the most abundant pharmaceutical (carbamazepine) to be reduced while maintaining the current phosphorus level. This study demonstrates the ability of immediate lake regulation measures to maintain water quality. In the case of Lake Tegel, the pipeline can be fully effective with regard to pharmaceuticals only in combination with additional efforts such as advanced pharmaceutical treatment of wastewater and/or phosphorus reduction in the River Havel catchment.

AB Release of pharmaceuticals in the environment has been emerging as a great concern for ecosystem and human health. Ibuprofen (IBU) represents one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments in spite of the high removal rates occurring in conventional wastewater technologies. To assess the potentiality of phytoremediation in assisting these technologies, the screening of plant species for tolerance and removal ability of pollutants is a very important issue. In this study, the effects of different IBU concentrations on callus cultures of Populus nigra L, a pioneer tree species in the riparian ecosystem, were investigated. Results evidenced a notable tolerance of poplar cells to IBU, especially at high concentrations (IBU 30 mg L-1), which even stimulated growth. At this concentration, the ability to withstand IBU was accompanied by inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, reduction of lipid peroxide content and increase of membrane redox activity. Irrespective of initial IBU concentrations, a complete removal of this compound from the growth medium by poplar cells during a subculture occurred. Antioxidative enzyme activities and polyamine content were stimulated by IBU 0.03 mg L-1, while no effect was found in cells exposed to IBU 30 mg L-1, except for a decrease of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity. These findings put in evidence a notable potential of this plant species for the phytoremediation of IBU-contaminated substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the hypothesis that light supply can impact the removal of veterinary antibiotics during livestock wastewater treatment in high rate algal ponds (HRAPs), this study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms of tetracycline removal in these systems. For this purpose, two HRAPs were fed with synthetic wastewater for 46 days before tetracycline was added at 2 mg L-1 to the influent of one of the reactors (Te-HRAP). From day 62, dissolved tetracycline removal stabilized around 69 +/- 1% in the Te-HRAP and evidence from batch assays suggests that this removal was mainly caused by photodegradation and biosorption. Tetracycline addition was followed by the deflocculation of the Te-HRAP biomass but had otherwise no apparent impact on the removal of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biomass productivity. The results from the batch assays also suggested that the light-shading and/or pollutant-sequestrating effects of the biomass limited tetracycline removal in the pond. For the first time, these results demonstrate that the shallow geometry of HRAPs is advantageous to support the photodegradation of antibiotics during wastewater biological treatment but that the presence of these pollutants could hamper biomass recovery. These findings have significant implications for algal-based environmental biotechnologies and must be confirmed under field conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ketoprofen and diclofenac are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for similar indications, and both are frequently found in surface waters. Diclofenac affects organ histology and gene expression in fish at around 1 mu g/L. Here, we exposed rainbow trout to ketoprofen (1, 10 and 100 mu g/L) to investigate if this alternative causes less risk for pharmacological responses in fish. The bioconcentration factor from water to fish blood plasma was <0.05(4 for diclofenac based on previous studies). Ketoprofen only reached up to 0.6 parts per thousand of the human therapeutic plasma concentration, thus the probability of target-related effects was estimated to be fairly low. Accordingly, a comprehensive analysis of hepatic gene expression revealed no consistent responses. In some contrast, trout exposed to undiluted, treated sewage effluents bioconcentrated ketoprofen and other NSAIDs much more efficiently, according to a meta-analysis of recent studies. Neither of the setups is however an ideal representation of the field situation. If a controlled exposure system with a single chemical in pure water is a reasonable representation of the environment, then the use of ketoprofen is likely to pose a lower risk for wild fish than diclofenac, but if bioconcentration factors from effluent-exposed fish are applied, the risks may be more similar.

AB The Haihe River System (HRS) drains the Chinese megacities Beijing and Tianjin, forming a large-scale irrigation system severely impacted by wastewater-borne pollution. The origin, temporal magnitudes, and annual mass fluxes of a wide range of pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and pesticides were investigated in the HRS, which drains 70% of the wastewater discharged by 20 million people living in Beijing. Based on Chinese consumption statistics and our initial screening for 268 micropollutants using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 62 compounds were examined in space and time (2009-2010). The median concentrations ranged from 3 ng/L for metolachlor to 1100 ng/L for benzotriazole and sucralose. Concentrations of carbendazim, clarithromycin, diclofenac, and diuron exceed levels of ecotoxicological concern. Mass-flux analyses revealed that pharmaceuticals (5930 kg/year) and most household chemicals (5660 kg/year) originated from urban wastewaters, while the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole entered the rivers through other pathways. Total pesticide residues amounted to 1550 kg/year. Per capita loads of pharmaceuticals in wastewater were lower than those in Europe, but are expected to increase in the near future. As 95% of the river water is diverted to irrigate agricultural soil, the loads of polar organic micropollutants transported with the water might pose a serious threat to food safety and groundwater quality.

AB German Environment Specimen Bank (GESB) fish tissue samples, collected from 14 different GESB locations, were analyzed for 15 pharmaceuticals, 2 pharmaceutical metabolites, and 12 personal care products. Only 2 pharmaceuticals, diphenhydramine and desmethylsertraline, were measured above MDL. Diphenhydramine (0.04-0.07 ng g(-1) ww) and desmethylsertraline (1.65-3.28 ng g(-1) ww) were measured at 4 and 2 locations, respectively. The maximum concentrations of galaxolide (HHCB) (447 ng g(-1) ww) and tonalide (AHTN) (15 ng g(-1) ww) were measured at the Rehlingen sampling site in the Saar River. A significant decrease in HHCB and AHTN fish tissue concentrations was observed from 1995 to 2008 at select GESB sampling sites (r(2) = 0.69-0.89 for galaxolide and 0.89-0.97 for tonalide with p < 0.003). Galaxolide and tonalide fish tissue concentrations in Germany were similar to 9X and similar to 28X lower, respectively, as compared to fish tissue concentrations measured in a United States nationwide PPCP study conducted in 2006. Proximity of the sampling locations to the upstream wastewater treatment plant discharging point and mean annual flow at the sampling location were found to significantly predict galaxolide and tonalide fish tissue concentrations (HHCB: r(2) = 0.79, p = 0.021 and AHTN: r(2) = 0.81, p = 0.037) in Germany.

AB Efficient removal of total organic matter, ammonia and four target corticosteroids, levonogestrel (Levo), bethametasone valerate (Betha-V), betharnetasone dipropionate (Betha-D) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Medro), was achieved in a laboratory-scale submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating wastewater from a pharmaceutical industry. MBR was operated for a period of 20 weeks under a constant flux of 2.87 L h(-1) M-2 without substantial membrane fouling. Total organic matter removal, measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), was on average over 99%. Regarding nutrients, 99% of the initial ammonia and 40% of phosphorous were eliminated. The industrial wastewater was spiked with four target corticosteroids at a final concentration of 100 mu g L-1 in order to assess their elimination. Chemical analysis of MBR effluent revealed that all corticosteroids were removed at percentages higher than 93% in all the cases. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the occurrence of antibiotics in sewage treatment plant effluent, as well as drinking water, has raised concern about their potential impacts on the environment and public health. Antibiotics are found in surface and ground waters, which indicate their ineffective removal by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have received considerable attention for the removal of antibiotics. This study was conducted to evaluate the degradation and mineralization of antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and chlortetracycline) using an electron beam, ozone and UV, and the change of toxicity. Also, the electrical energy consumption based on the EE/O parameter (the electrical energy required per order of pollutants removal in 1 m(3) wastewater) was used to quantify the energy cost associated with the different AOPs (electron beam, ozone and UV) for the degradation of antibiotics. The results showed that an electron beam effective for the removals of both sulfamethoxazole and chlortetracycline in aqueous solutions. However, degradation of the target compounds by ozone and UV showed different trends. The oxidation efficiency of each organic compound was very dependent upon the AOP used. Algal toxicity was significantly reduced after each treatment. However, based on the electrical energy, the electron beam was more efficient than ozone and UV. Electron beam treatment could be an effective and safe method for the removal of antibiotic compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many xenobiotics entering wastewater treatment plants are known to be persistent during wastewater treatment and tend to adsorb to sewage sludge. The application of sewage sludge as fertilizer in agriculture may pose the risk of an incorporation of xenobiotics in the cultivated plants and, finally, an inclusion into the food chain. This study was performed to investigate the uptake of common sewage sludge contaminants, galaxolide, tonalide, and triclosan, by plants used for human consumption and livestock feeding. Barley, meadow fescue, and four carrot cultivars were sown and grown in spiked soils under greenhouse conditions. After harvesting the plants, roots and leaves were analyzed separately, and the respective bioconcentration factors were calculated. In carrots, a concentration gradient of the xenobiotics became evident that decreased from the root peel via root core to the leaves. A significant influence of the differing root lipid contents on the uptake rates cannot be supported by our data, but the crucial influence of soil organic carbon content was confirmed. Barley and meadow fescue roots incorporated higher amounts of the target substances than carrots, but translocation into the leaves was negligible. The results indicated that an introduction of persistent semi- and nonpolar xenobiotics into the food chain via edible plants like carrots could be of certain relevance when sludge is applied as fertilizer. Due to low rates found for the translocation of the xenobiotics into the aerial plant parts, the entrance pathway into food products via feeding livestock is less probable.

AB Carbon nanotube-supported manganese oxides (MnOx/MWCNT) were used as catalysts to assist ozone in degrading ciprofloxacin in water. Manganese oxides were successfully loaded on multi-walled carbon nanotube surfaces by simply impregnating the carbon nanotube with permanganate solution. The catalytic activities of MnOx/MWCNT in ciprofloxacin ozonation, including degradation, mineralization effectiveness, and antibacterial activity change, were investigated. The presence of MnOx/MWCNT significantly elevated the degradation and mineralization efficiency of ozone on ciprofloxacin. The microbiological assay with a reference Escherichia coli strain indicated that ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT results in more effective antibacterial activity inhibition of ciprofloxacin than that in ozonation alone. The effects of catalyst dose, initial ciprofloxacin concentration, and initial pH conditions on ciprofloxacin ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT were surveyed. Electron spin resonance trapping was applied to assess the role of MnOx/MWCNT in generating hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) during ozonation. Stronger 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide-OH signals were observed in the ozonation with MnOx/MWCNT compared with those in ozonation alone, indicating that MnOx/MWCNT promoted the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The degradation of ciprofloxacin was studied in drinking water and wastewater process samples to gauge the potential effects of water background matrix on MnOx/MWCNT catalytic ozonation.

AB The analysis of sewage for urinary biomarkers of illicit drugs is a promising and complementary approach for estimating the use of these substances in the general population. For the first time, this approach was simultaneously applied in 19 European cities, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a 1-week period. An inter-laboratory comparison study was performed to evaluate the analytical performance of the participating laboratories. Raw 24-hour composite sewage samples were collected from 19 European cities during a single week in March 2011 and analyzed for the urinary biomarkers of cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and cannabis using in-house optimized and validated analytical methods. The load of each substance used in each city was back-calculated from the measured concentrations. The data show distinct temporal and spatial patterns in drug use across Europe. Cocaine use was higher in Western and Central Europe and lower in Northern and Eastern Europe. The extrapolated total daily use of cocaine in Europe during the study period was equivalent to 356 kg/day. High per capita ecstasy loads were observed in Dutch cities, as well as in Antwerp and London. In general, cocaine and ecstasy loads were significantly elevated during the weekend compared to weekdays. Per-capita loads of methamphetamine were highest in Helsinki and Turku, Oslo and Budweis, while the per capita loads of cannabis were similar throughout Europe. This study shows that a standardized analysis for illicit drug urinary biomarkers in sewage can be applied to estimate and compare the use of these substances at local and international scales. This approach has the potential to deliver important information on drug markets (supply indicator). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drug concentrations in composite municipal wastewater samples and census-based estimates of population are used to derive daily loads of illicit substances that are indexed to population. However, such estimates do not provide information on the diurnal trends of substance excretion nor can they account for changes in population. To address these limitations, a series of 1 h composites created by sampling wastewater influent at 6 mm intervals was collected over four consecutive days at a single wastewater treatment plant. Creatinine (a urinary indicator), caffeine, methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine (BZE), and cocaine were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Diurnal trends and between-day trends were substance specific and related to the number of estimated doses and excretory half-life. Normalization to creatinine yielded trends in substances that differed significantly from non-normalized trends by accounting for changes in population within the municipality studied. Increases in normalized substance excretion observed during early morning hours originate from individuals among the resident population of the municipality due to the absence of commuters.

AB In this study, chitin (CT) has been used as a potential sorbent for the removal of antibiotic drug Gatifloxacin (GF) from aqueous solutions using batch experiments. The equilibrium drug uptake was studied as a function of sorbent dose, pH of sorbate solution and temperature. The experimental data was analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. It was found that to some extent, all the models showed their suitability. The equilibrium sorption capacity obtained at 18, 28 and 37 degrees C was 97.108 +/- 2.35, 100.0 +/- 3.23 and 181.818 +/- 5.58 mg g(-1) respectively. The optimum uptake was found to be in the drug solution with pH value of nearly 6.0. The thermodynamic parameters, free energy change (Lambda G degrees(sorp)), change in enthalpy (Lambda H degrees) and change in entropy (Delta S degrees) of sorption, were evaluated using equilibrium uptake data obtained at three temperatures. Delta G degrees(sorp) was calculated from Langmuir, Frumkin and modified Frumkin models. The negative value of Delta G degrees(sorp) and positive. Delta H degrees indicated that drug uptake process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature respectively. The mean sorption energy E, as determined using Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model, was found to be 7.424 +/- 0.03 kJ mol(-1) thus, indicating physical sorption process. Finally, the sorption of drug was also confirmed by antimicrobial test.

AB Biowastes produced by humans and animals are routinely disposed of on land, and concern is now growing that such practices provide a pathway for fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibacterial agents and their environmental metabolites (FQEMs) to contaminate the terrestrial environment. The focus of concern is that FQs and FQEMs may accumulate in amended soils to then adversely impact on the terrestrial environment. One postulated impact is the development of a selective environment in which FQ-resistant bacteria may grow. To find evidence in support of an accumulation of antibacterial-like activity, it was first necessary to establish whether any biologically active FQEMs could be synthesized by physicochemical factors that are normally present in the environment. However, many FQEMs are not commercially available to be used as standards in such studies. FQEMs were therefore synthesized using well-defined processes. They were subsequently analyzed using spectroscopy (UV-vis) and high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection. The antibacterial-like activities of fractionated FQEMs were then assessed in novel bacterial growth inhibition bioassays, and results were compared to those obtained from instrumental analyses.
   Parent FQs were either exposed to sunlight or were synthesized using defined aerobic microbial (Mycobacterium gilvum or a mixed culture derived from an agricultural soil) fermentation processes. Mixtures of FQEMs derived from photo- and (intracellular) microbial processes were isolated by preparative chromatography and centrifugation techniques, respectively. Mixtures were subsequently fractionated using analytical high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), and excised analytes were tested in bioautography assays for their antibacterial-like activities. Two bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Azospirillum brasilense (A. brasilense) were used as reporter organisms in testing FQ standards and any subtle differences between biologically active FQEMs of ciprofloxacin (CF).
   FQEMs produced in the photo-synthetic process had UV-vis profiles that were indistinguishable from the parent FQs, and yet mass spectral data revealed the presence of N-formylciprofloxacin (FCF). In contrast, the UV-vis profiles of FQEMs synthesized by M. gilvum and a mixed culture of microorganisms had UV-vis profiles that were similar to one another and markedly different to the parent fluoroquinolones. Mass spectral studies confirmed the presence of FCF and N-acetylciprofloxacin in both microbial ferments. In addition, a photo-FQEM (Cp 6), three M. gilvum FQEMs (Cm 5, Cm 8, and Cm 10) and a mixed culture FQEM (Cs 6) of CF and many other FQEMs of CF, norfloxacin (NF), and enrofloxacin (EF) were fractionated using HPTLC, although their identities have yet to be confirmed. Differences between bioautography results were obtained when E. coli or A. brasilense were used as reporter organisms. Parent FQs (CF and EF) and the FQEMs of CF (Cp 6, Cm 8, and Cs 6) displayed antibacterial-like activity when using E. coli as the reporter organism. In contrast, A. brasilense was insensitive to parent CF and sensitive to EF and all tested FQEMs of CF. Results are consistent with photo- and microbial processes modifying CF in different ways, with the latter changing the UV-vis chromophores. It can be inferred that a lack of detection of analytes (especially photo-FQEMs) when using UV-vis does not necessarily indicate an absence of analyte. Additionally, similarities between the UV-vis profiles of FQEMs extracted from the (monoculture) M. gilvum and the mixed culture microbial aerobic ferments are consistent with similar processes operating in both ferments. Results of HPTLC and bioautography studies revealed that mixtures of (photo- and microbial) FQEMs could be fractionated into individual components.
   Bioactive FQEMs of ciprofloxacin, as a representative FQ, can be synthesized by photo- and microbial processes, and their detection required the use of both instrumental and bioautography analytical techniques. It is likely that such FQEMs will also be present on agricultural land that has been repeatedly amended with FQ-contaminated biosolids.
   The use of instrumental analytical techniques alone and especially photometric detection techniques will underestimate antibacterial-like activities of FQEMs. Moreover, the extraction technique(s) and the selected toxicological endpoint(s) require careful consideration when assessing bioactivity. It is therefore recommended that instrumental analytical techniques and several bioautography assays be performed concurrently, and bioautography assays should use a variety of reporter organisms. Two types of bacterial growth bioassays are recommended in any assessment of antibacterial-like activity derived from CF (and possibly from other FQs). A standardized E. coli bioassay should be used as a general screening procedure to facilitate intra- and inter-laboratory exchange of data. Additionally, soil-specific (region-specific) growth inhibition bioassays should be undertaken using several species of endemic soil bacteria. It is likely that the two sets of data will be useful in future risk assessment processes.

AB Antibacterial fluoroquinolones (FQs) are third-generation antibiotics that are commonly used as therapeutic treatments of respiratory and urinary tract infections. They are used far less in intensively farmed animal production systems, though their use may be permitted in the veterinary treatments of flocks or in medicated feeds. When used, only a fraction of ingested parent FQ actually reaches the in vivo target site of infection, while the remainder is excreted as the parent FQ and its metabolized products. In many species' metabolism, enrofloxacin (EF) is converted into ciprofloxacin (CF) while both FQs are classified as parent FQs in human treatments. It is therefore likely that both FQs and their metabolic products will contribute to a common pool of metabolites in biological wastes. Wastes from intensive farming practices are either directly applied to agricultural land without treatment or may be temporarily stored prior to disposal. However, human waste is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) where it is converted into biosolids. In the storage or treatment process of STPs, FQs and their in vivo metabolites are further converted into other environmental metabolites (FQEMs) by ex vivo physicochemical processes that act and interact to produce complex mixtures of FQEMs, some of which have antibacterial-like activities. Biosolids are then often applied to agricultural land as a fertilizer amendment where FQs and FQEMs can be further converted into additional FQEMs by soil processes. It is therefore likely that FQ-contaminated biowaste-treated soils will contain complex mixtures of FQEMs, some of which may have antibacterial-like activities that may be expressed on bacteria endemic to the receiving agricultural soil environment. Concern has arisen in the scientific and in the general community that repeated use of FQ-contaminated biowaste as fertilizer amendments of nutrient-impoverished agricultural land may create a selective environment in which FQ-resistant bacteria might grow. The likelihood of this happening will depend, to some extent, on whether bioactive FQEMs are first synthesized from the parent FQs by the action and interaction of in vivo and ex vivo processes producing bioactive FQEMs in biowastes and biosolids. The postulated creation of a selective environment will also depend, in part, on whether such bioactive FQEMs are biologically available to bacteria, which may, in turn, be influenced by soil type, amendment regime, and the persistence of the bioactive FQEMs. Additionally, soil bacteria and soil processes may be affected in different ways or extents by bioactive FQEMs that could possibly act additively or synergistically at ecological targets in these non-target bacteria. This is an important consideration, since, while parent FQs have well-defined ecological targets (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) and modes of bactericidal action, the FQEMs and their possible modes of action on the many different species of soil bacteria is less well studied. It is therefore understandable that there is a lack of conclusive evidence directly attributing biosolid usage to any increase in FQ-resistant bacteria detected in biowaste-amended agricultural soil. However, a lack of evidence may simply imply that a causal relationship between biosolid usage programs and any detection of low levels of FQ-resistant bacteria in soils has yet to be established, rather than an assumption of no relationship whatsoever.
   Based on results presented in this paper, the precautionary principle should be applied in the usage of FQ-contaminated biosolids as fertilizer amendments of agricultural land. The aim of this research was to test whether any bioactive FQEMs of EF could be synthesized by aerobic fermentation processes using Mycobacterium gilvum (American Tissue Culture Collection) and a mixed culture of microorganisms derived from an agricultural soil. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and bioautography were tested as screening techniques in the detection and analysis of bioactive FQEMs.
   FQEMs derived from M. gilvum and mixed (soil) culture aerobic ferments were fractionated using preparative HPTLC. A standard strain of Escherichia coli was then used as the reporter organism in a bioautography assay in the detection of bioactive-FQEMs on a mid-section of the HPTLC plate. Plate sections were reassembled, and a photograph was taken under low-intensity ultraviolet (UV) light to reveal regions that contained analytes that had UV chromophores and antibacterial-like activities.
   Many fractionated FQEMs displayed antibacterial-like activity while bound to silica gel HPTLC plates. These results also provide evidence that sufficient quantities of biologically active FQEMs were biologically available from a silica gel surface to prevent the adherent growth of E. coli. Six to seven FQEMs derived from EF using aerobic fermentation processes had antibacterial-like activities, while two FQEMs were also detectable using UV light. Furthermore, similar banding patterns of antibacterial-like activity were observed in both the monoculture (M. gilvum) and mixed culture bioautography assays, indicating that similar processes operated in both aerobic fermentations, either producing similar biologically active FQEMs or biologically active FQEMs that had similar physicochemical properties in both ferments. The simplest explanation for these findings is that the tested agricultural soil also contained mycobacteria that metabolized EF in a similar way to the purchased standard monoculture M. gilvum. Additionally, the marked contrast between the bioautography results and the UV results indicated that the presence of UV chromophores is not a prerequisite for the detection of antibacterial-like activity.
   A reliance on spectrophotometric techniques in the detection of bioactive FQEMs in the environment may underestimate component antibacterial-like activity and, possibly, total antibacterial-like activity expressed by EF and its FQEMs. The described bioautography method provides a screening technique with which antibacterial-like activities derived from EF and possibly other FQs can be detected directly on silica gel HPTLC plates.
   It is recommended that both bioassay and instrumental analytical techniques be used in any measurement of hazard and risk relating to antibacterial-like activities in the environment that are derived from fluoroquinolone antibiotics and their environmental metabolites.

AB In some countries effluents from hospitals and households are directly emitted into open ditches without any further treatment and with very little dilution. Under such circumstances photo- and biodegradation in the environment can occur. However, these processes do not necessarily end up with the complete mineralization of a chemical. Therefore, the biodegradability of photoproduct(s) by environmental bacteria is of interest.
   Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally. Captopril (CP) is used in this study as it is widely used in Egypt and stated as one of the essential drugs in Egypt for hypertension. Three tests from the OECD series were used for biodegradation testing: Closed Bottle test (CBT; OECD 301 D), Manometric Respirometry test (MRT; OECD 301 F) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT; OECD 302 B). Photodegradation (150W medium-pressure Hg-lamp) of CP was studied. Also CBT was performed for captopril disulfide (CPDS) and samples received after 64 min and 512 min of photolysis.
   The primary elimination of CP and CPDS was monitored by LC-UV at 210 nm and structures of photoproducts were assessed by LC-UV-MS/MS (ion trap). Analysis of photodegradation samples by LC-MS/MS revealed CP sulfonic acid as the major photodegradation product of CP. No biodegradation was observed for CP, CPDS and of the mixture resulting from photo-treatment after 64 min in CBT. Partial biodegradation in the CBT and MRT was observed in samples taken after 512 min photolysis and for CP itself in MRT. Complete biodegradation and mineralization of CP occurred in the ZWT.

AB This research investigates the environmental behavior of two widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering statin drugs that are expected to be present at significant concentrations in wastewater influents, namely: atorvastatin and simvastatin. Batch biodegradation experiments suggest that both statins are well degraded during secondary treatment, and removal rates exhibit a substrate-enhancement model reflecting elements of both first-order behavior and cometabolism. Resulting biodegradation parameters are used in conjunction with literature sorption parameters to construct a mass-balance model of statin concentrations during conventional treatment. Model results exhibit excellent accuracy compared to measurements from a medium-sized WWTP in the Southeastern USA. Influent concentrations of 1.56 mu g L-1 and 1.23.mu g L-1 were measured for atorvastatin and simvastatin. Results also suggest that 85-90% of each drug is removed during conventional treatment, with sorption accounting for less than 10% of overall removal. Expected effluent concentrations are orders of magnitude less than previously reported ecotoxicity thresholds for both drugs. Overall, results suggest statin active ingredients do not pose a significant environmental threat. It is recommended that future work characterize the fate of statin metabolites and that the same mass-balance modeling approach be used to assess other highly-prescribed pharmaceutical drugs.

AB Pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous in surface waters as a consequence of discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants. However, few studies have assessed the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals to fish in natural waters. In the present study, passive samplers and rainbow trout were experimentally deployed next to three municipal wastewater treatment plants in Finland to evaluate the degree of animal exposure. Pharmaceuticals from several therapeutic classes (in total 15) were analyzed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry in extracts of passive samplers and in bile and blood plasma of rainbow trout held at polluted sites for 10?d. Each approach indicated the highest exposure near wastewater treatment plant A and the lowest near that of plant C. Diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen were found in rainbow trout, and their concentrations in bile were 10 to 400 times higher than in plasma. The phase I metabolite hydroxydiclofenac was also detected in bile. Hence, bile proved to be an excellent sample matrix for the exposure assessment of fish. Most of the monitored pharmaceuticals were found in passive samplers, implying that they may overestimate the actual exposure of fish in receiving waters. Two biomarkers, hepatic vitellogenin and cytochrome P4501A, did not reveal clear effects on fish, although a small induction of vitellogenin mRNA was observed in trout caged near wastewater treatment plants B and C.

AB The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine have been investigated in 101 anaerobic lab-scale digesters with continuous stirring and mesophilic conditions at 37 degrees C to investigate whether they would be reduced or accumulated in sewage sludge depending on whether the bacteria present were able to use the SSRIs as a carbon source or not. The total SSRI concentration had a significant reduction in concentration during the anaerobic treatment process from theoretically 0.58 mg/l to 0.21 mg/l after 17 days. However, large differences in the reduction of the different compounds were found. Paroxetine and citalopram were found to be almost completely reduced at day 24 with reductions of 85% (citalopram) and 98% (paroxetine). Reductions of 32% (fluoxetine), 53% (fluvoxamine) and 38% (sertraline) indicate that these three compounds have a higher potential for accumulation. None metabolites of these compounds were found in the samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation as final wastewater (WW) polishing step, following conventional activated sludge treatment is increasingly implemented in sewage treatment for contaminant degradation to prevent surface water pollution. While the oxidative degradation of chemicals has been extensively investigated, the in vivo toxicological characteristics of ozonated whole effluents are rarely a matter of research.
   In the present study, whole effluents were toxicologically evaluated with an in vivo test battery before and after full-scale ozonation and subsequent sand filtration on site at a treatment plant. One aquatic plant (duckweed, Lemna minor) and five invertebrate species of different systematic groups (Lumbriculus variegatus, Chironomus riparius, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Daphnia magna) were exposed to the effluents in a flow-through-designed test system with a test duration of 7-28 d.
   None of the considered toxicity endpoints correlated with the pollutant elimination. A tendency towards an increased toxicity after ozonation was apparent in three of the test systems showing [statistically] significant adverse effects in the L. variegatus toxicity test (decrease in reproduction and biomass). After sand filtration, adverse effects were reduced to a similar level like after conventional treatment. Solely the Daphnia reproduction test revealed beneficial effects after ozonation in combination with sand filtration.
   Results of the test battery indicate the formation of adverse oxidation products during WW ozonation. L. variegatus appeared to be the most sensitive of the five test species. Sand filtration effectively removes or detoxifies toxic oxidation products, as toxic effects were subsequently reduced to the level after conventional treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of pharmaceuticals has increased enormously over the last few decades and serious concerns about their environmental fate and effects have arisen. Thus far, there is little knowledge about the historical pollution of the environment by pharmaceuticals. In the present study, sediment columns from three lake sites adjacent to wastewater treatment plants were collected, further divided in 2- or 2.5-cm slices, and analyzed for 15 pharmaceuticals by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, sediment columns were historically interpreted by analyzing fecal sterols (coprostanol and cholesterol) as well as organic material and organic carbon. Several pharmaceuticals were detected in sediments, the most abundant being citalopram, bisoprolol, and propranolol. At site A, pharmaceuticals prevailed only in the uppermost 15?cm, whereas at site B they existed in the whole sediment column (030?cm). Pharmaceuticals were not found in site C sediments. Based on the sterol analyses, municipal wastewater contamination at sites A, B, and C was found in the uppermost 15, 30, and 20?cm, respectively. For the first time, contamination of sediments by pharmaceuticals was demonstrated below the subsurface (up to a depth of 30?cm). When considering the consumption and the observed concentration profiles of pharmaceuticals, a clear increasing trend of citalopram toward the surface was evident at site A. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Concentrations of six endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), were assessed in influents, effluents and excess sludge in ten municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area, Chongqing, China. Three types of activated sludge treatment processes, oxidation ditch (OD), reversed anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (rA(2)/O) technology and sequential batch reactor (SBR), were used in the surveyed WWTPs. These WWTPs were all combined landfill leachate-sewage treatment plants. All analytes were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) in the dissolved phase and by accelerated solvent-based extraction (ASE) in sludge. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed for the analysis of EDCs. Among these EDCs, BPA was the most frequently detected and abundant compound (100.0-10566.7 ng L-1, 15.5-1210.7 ng L-1 and 85.0-2470.4 ng g(-1) with respect to the influents, effluents and excess sludge samples). The greatest levels of steroidal estrogens in municipal influents were observed in E-3 which were all >100 ng L-1, followed by E-1 (42.2-110.7 ng L-1) and E-2 (7.4-32.7 ng L-1), and in the effluents and sludge were E-1 > E-3 > E-2 which were all <31 ng L-1 and 105 ng g(-1), respectively. Regarding synthetic estrogens, EE2 was frequently detected in the influents, occurring below 50 ng L-1, while DES was not detected at all. A high correlation coefficient was observed between the leachate-sludge ratio and concentrations of influent EDCs, and it was statistically significant (i.e., R > 0.65, P < 0.05), but removal efficiency of the EDCs did not show significant differences with OD, rA(2)/O and SBR processes. Furthermore, modification of treatment technology as well as operational parameters, such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), sludge retention time (SRT) and disinfection process (DP), were recommended to further eliminate the residual EDCs.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) enter the environment mainly through municipal wastewater effluents, agricultural run-off, pharmaceutical and related chemical industry discharges. The present study was conducted to remove PPCPs through nano-filtration (NF) membranes prepared with two different tailor-made polymeric additives. The first is a novel charged surface modifying macromolecule (CSMM) additive synthesized by reactive diisocyanate and dihydroxy naphthalene disulfonate. The second additive was a tailor made hydrophilic SMM (LSMM), which was manufactured incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) as end groups. Cellulose acetate (CA) membranes with and without 3 wt% CSMM or LSMM were prepared by the phase inversion technique. The membranes were characterized by static contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer, and atomic force microscopy. The NF filtration studies were conducted at two different operating pressures (150 and 400 psig). They consisted of pure water flux tests, sodium chloride separation tests, and individual PPCP (ppm level carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethazine) separation tests. The long term NF performance for the removal of ibuprofen was also conducted. Significant effect of CSMM blending on the separation performance of ibuprofen for long hours operation was observed.

AB Wetlands are a popular tool to treat/polish wastewater by reducing nutrient loading into the environment. In addition to nutrients, organic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), are commonly detected in treated wastewater. Treatment wetlands may reduce concentrations of PPCPs before the treated effluent enters rivers and streams. Oxygen status may greatly affect the attenuation of PPCPs in wetland sediments by influencing microbial makeup and activity. An understanding of the effect of redox conditions on the degradation of PPCPs and the factors influencing PPCP sorption to wetland sediments is needed to maximize PPCP removal in treatment wetlands.
   Three wetland sediments from the San Diego Creek and Newport Bay watershed in Southern California, USA, were incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to assess the degradation of several regularly occurring PPCPs and their phase distribution as a function of time.
   Under aerobic conditions, ibuprofen, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), and gemfibrozil generally had half-life values around 20 days, while the half-life of carbamazepine was substantially longer (between 165 and 264 days). The anaerobic half-lives of gemfibrozil and ibuprofen increased by factors of 11-34 and carbamazepine increased by factors of 1.5-2.5. There was no detectable anaerobic degradation of DEET. The apparent phase distribution coefficient increased over time for DEET, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil, indicating that sorption of PPCPs to wetland sediments may be more limited than that predicted using equilibrium sorption coefficient values.
   Knowledge of the capacity of wetland sediments for degrading and sorbing PPCPs is vital to the design of treatment wetlands. Degradation of the selected PPCPs was enhanced under aerobic conditions as compared to anaerobic conditions. Sorption to sediments increased with contact time, indicating that longer hydraulic retention will increase wetland capabilities for removing PPCPs.

AB An analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of six selected endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs: diltiazem, progesterone, benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), estrone, carbamazepine (Cbz), acetaminophen) was developed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ES-MS/MS). All of the parameters for HPLC and ES-MS/MS systems including mobile phase composition, flow rate, and sample injection volume were optimized to obtain not only the best separation of species interested but also low detection limits. Reverse phase chromatography coupled to ES-MS/MS was used for the separation and detection of EDCs. Formic acid (0.10% ) and 5.0 mM ammonium formate were selected as mobile phase composition in gradient elution. Detection limits for diltiazem, progesterone, BBP, estrone, Cbz, and acetaminophen were found to be 0.13, 0.12, 0.04, 0.13, 0.12, and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Influent and effluents from three different wastewater treatment plants located in Ankara, i.e., rotating flat-sheet membrane unit, pilot type flat-sheet membrane unit located at METU Campus and samples from Ankara central wastewater treatment plant were analyzed for their EDCs contents under the optimum conditions.

AB The anti-microbial substance triclosan can partition to sewage sludge during wastewater treatment and subsequently transfer to soil when applied to land. Here, we describe the fate of triclosan in a one-year plot experiment on three different soils receiving sludge. Triclosan and methyl-triclosan concentrations were measured in soil samples collected monthly from three depths. A large fraction of triclosan loss appeared to be explained by transformation to methyl-triclosan. After 12 months less than 20% of the initial triclosan was recovered from each soil. However, the majority was recovered as methyl-triclosan. Most of the chemical recovered at the end of the experiment (both triclosan and methyl-triclosan) was still in the top 10 cm layer, although there was translocation to lower soil horizons in all three soils. Between 16.5 and 50.6% of the applied triclosan was unaccounted for after 12 months either as a consequence of degradation or the formation of non-extractable residues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study evaluated the effect of continuous and batch feeding on the removal of 8 pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, caffeine, salicylic acid, ketoprofen and clofibric acid) from synthetic wastewater in mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs). Both loading modes were operated at hydraulic application rates of 5.6 cm day(-1) and 2.8 cm day(-1). Except for carbamazepine, clofibric acid and naproxen, removal in CWs was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced under the batch versus continuous mode. For all compounds tested except naproxen, values for first-order decay constants (k) for drain and fill operation were higher than that for the continuous mode of operation. Correlation between the distribution coefficient (log D-ow) and removal efficiencies of pharmaceutical compounds in the CWs, showed that pharmaceutical removal efficiency was significantly (p < 0.1) and inversely correlated with log D-ow value, but not with log K-ow value.

AB Micropollutants and micro-organisms are major concerns for indirect potable reuse of municipal wastewater. In this study, the retention of pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals and micro-organisms in real membrane bioreactor (MBR) permeate matrix and in ultrapure water matrix by nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) process, and the impact of their retention on NF/RO membrane fouling, were investigated. NF 90 and ESPA2 membranes were chosen for this work. The RO membrane showed high retention for most of the molecules tested, whereas the NF membrane exhibited some variation in the retention of pesticides. The retention of pesticides and metals was enhanced by their interactions with the MBR permeate, while an almost complete retention of PAHs and micro-organisms was observed in both matrices. The presence of PAHs in the MBR permeate increased the permeability of the RO membrane, whereas no such effect was observed for pesticides, metals and micro-organisms. Also, phage leakage was detected when the NF/RO membrane was contaminated by bacteria, which may have caused a slight membrane damage. Pesticide rejection was found to be related to LogKow and molecular weight in ultrapure water at low concentrations (mu g/L level).

AB The consumption of pharmaceuticals and their excretion in wastewater is a continuous source of pollution for aquatic ecosystems. In certain cases these compounds are found in the environment at concentrations high enough to cause disturbance in aquatic organisms. Aware of this problem hospitals are giving increasing attention to the nature of their effluents and their impact on the environment, by implementing more efficient effluent management policies. This concern is justified in view of the large volumes of toxic products consumed (detergents, disinfectants, pharmaceuticals, chemical reagents, radioactive elements, etc.). Moreover, these effluents usually do not undergo any specific treatment before being discharged into urban sewage networks. In this article, we present a method for selecting the pharmaceuticals discharged in hospital effluents that have the worst impact on the aquatic ecosystem, primarily based on their bioaccumulation potential. This study focused on the pharmaceuticals consumed at the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), the second largest hospital structure in France (5200 hospital beds). Of the 960 substances consumed in HCL hospitals, a shortlist of 70 substances considered as being potentially bioaccumulable was established. The use of aggravating factors of risk has then led to the final selection of 14 priority compounds. They include 4 compounds consumed in large quantities in HCL hospitals, 6 endocrine disruptors and 4 potentially ecotoxic compounds. For all these compounds, it is now advisable to verify their bioaccumulation potential experimentally and confirm their presence in the environment. In addition, in order to monitor the risk relating to possible contamination of the food chain, it will be necessary to measure accumulated dose levels in species of different trophic levels. Lastly, chronic ecotoxicity tests will permit evaluating the danger and risk that some of these substances may represent for aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The applicability of blue light-emitting diode (LED, lambda = 465 nm) as the light source for environmental remediation by photocatalyst Bi2MoO6 was investigated. Two target compounds, phenol and ibuprofen (IBP), were selected as the model pollutants to evaluate the photocatalytic activities. The photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was also conducted to check the feasibility of using blue LED as the light source for the disinfection of bacteria. The results showed that efficient elimination of phenol and IBP and inactivation of E. coli were realized under a 3 W blue LED in the presence of Bi2MoO6. This demonstrates that LED is a competitive and promising alternative light source for the application in environmental remediation because the electrical energy consumption of LED decreased dramatically compared with other light source.

AB Residues of pharmaceuticals present in wastewater and sewage sludge are of concern due to their transfer to aquatic and terrestrial food chains and possible adverse effects on nontargeted organisms. In the present work, uptake and translocation of metformin, an antidiabetic II medicine, by edible plant species cultivated in agricultural soil have been investigated in greenhouse experiment. Metformin demonstrated a high uptake and translocation to oily seeds of rape (Brassica nap us cv. Sheik and Brassica rapa cv. Valo); expressed as an average bioconcentration factor (BCF, plant concentration over initial concentration in soil, both in dry weight), BCF values as high as 21.72 were measured. In comparison, BCFs for grains of the cereals wheat, barley, and oat were in the range of 0.29-1.35. Uptake and translocation to fruits and vegetables of tomato (BCFs 0.02-0.06), squash (BCFs 0.12-0.18), and bean (BCF 0.88) were also low compared to rape. BCFs for carrot, potato, and leaf forage B. napus cv. Sola were similar (BCF 1-4). Guanylurea, a known degradation product of metformin by microorganisms in activated sludge, was found in barley grains, bean pods, potato peel, and small potatoes. The mechanisms for transport of metformin and guanidine in plants are still unknown, whereas organic cation transporters (OCTs) in mammals are known to actively transport such compounds and may guide the way for further understanding of mechanisms also in plants.

AB Thermally activated persulfate (TAP) is discussed in the literature as remediation option for contaminated effluents. The present paper assesses the impact of selected operational parameters on the involved oxidative degradation using ibuprofen (IBU) as model contaminant and sodium persulfate (SPS) as model oxidizing agent. Tested parameters included SPS and IBU initial concentrations, activation temperature, solution pH and ionic strength. A specific objective was to identify the more appropriate kinetics model that can fit with the experimental data under specific conditions. A series of experiments were conducted at 60 degrees C keeping in excess only one of the two reactants (IBU or SPS) while varying the concentration of the other. Polynomial regressions were used to analyze IBU decay and relative t(1/2) were calculated based on the second order polynomial equations obtained. The results showed that at the initial stage of the oxidation (similar to 1-2 half-lives), the reactions can be described by the kinetics rate equation -d[IBU]/dt = 2.71 x 10(-4) (mM min(-1)) [IBU](0.25)[SPS](1) within the experimental conditions applied here e.g. 60 degrees C, pH 6.8-7.0, [IBU](0) 7.33-20.36 mu M and [SPS](0) 1.0-2.8 mM. HPLC/MS analysis showed the absence of by-products throughout the treatment process indicating at least partial mineralization of IBU. The results of this study confirmed that the developed model of TAP technology could be an adequate approach for specific treatment of small volumes of hot spot wastewater containing IBU like hospital effluents.

AB Stirred tank reactors (STRs) and fixed-bed reactors (FBRs) were applied for the removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and diazepam by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The operation of STRs with free pellets and immobilized fungus attained stable operation for 50 days. Both bioreactors achieved high removal efficiencies for diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen while partial removal of carbamazepine and diazepam. The configuration of the FBR maintained a steady and feasible operation for 100 days with complete removal of diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen regardless of the aeration system (air or oxygen) and remarkably high removal percentages of carbamazepine and diazepam: 60-90%. The extraction of the target compounds from the biomass and the support showed low residual concentrations of all the compounds both on fungal pellets and on the support of the FBR. Only significant values were detected in the STR with immobilized mycelium, demonstrating partial adsorption. A tentative identification of the degradation products of the three anti-inflammatories was performed, indicating the presence of 4-hydroxy-diclofenac, 1-hydroxy-ibuprofen-, 6-O-desmethyl-naproxen, as the major degradation products of the three parent compounds.

AB This study aimed at investigating the reactivity of aniline-based pharmaceuticals with sulfate radical anion generated by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)/Cobalt(II) system and by taking sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac as probe compounds. Transformation pathways were proposed for both pharmaceuticals relying on the identification of the main reaction intermediate products using liquid chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry. For diclofenac, the major transformation pathway led to the formation of a quinone imine derivative while for sulfamethoxazole a nitro derivative was obtained as the major intermediate. However, in both cases, oxidative reactions started with the formation of a N-centered radical probably through an one-electron transfer from the pharmaceutical to sulfate radical anion. This was followed by further multistep degradation involving decarboxylation, hydroxylation and bond cleavage reactions in route to mineralization. From a kinetic point of view, aniline-based pharmaceuticals quickly reacted with sulfate radical anion with second order kinetic rate constants in the 9-10 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) Sulfate radical-based technologies show promising results for the removal of these particular pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant effluents mainly because of the higher selectivity of sulfate radical anion over hydroxyl radical, limiting radical scavenging by natural organic matter and allowing for higher abatement and mineralization rates.

AB In this work, the distribution and the ecotoxicological risk of sixteen pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to seven different therapeutic groups (five anti-inflammatory drugs, two antibiotics, an anti-epileptic drug, a beta-blocker, a nervous stimulant, four estrogens and two lipid regulators) have been studied in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. Only three of the sixteen pharmaceutical compounds were never detected in sludge while eleven of the studied pharmaceuticals were still detected in compost. Mean concentration levels of the pharmaceutically active compounds ranged between 24.9 and 4105 mu g/kg dm, 14.5-944 mu g/kg dm, 3.29-636 mu g/kg dm and 9.19-974 mu g/kg dm in primary, secondary, digested sludge and compost, respectively. An increase in the concentration levels of most of the pharmaceuticals was observed from summer to winter (mean values in primary and secondary sludge were 304 and 85.1 mu g/kg dm in summer and 435 and 175 mu g/kg dm in winter, respectively) probably due to an increase of their consumption during the coldest season and a reduction of the microbial activity under colder temperatures. The highest ecotoxicological risk, in digested sludge and compost, was due to the estrogenic compound 17 beta-estradiol. The ecotoxicological risk significantly decreased after the application of digested sludge or compost to the soils (risk quotient values ranged between 0.04 and 252 in digested sludge and 0.002-37.8 in compost and decreased to 8.10(-4)-1.92 in digested sludge-amended soil and 1.10(-4)-0.23 in compost-amended soil).

AB There is little quantitative information on the temporal trends of pharmaceuticals and other emerging compounds, including artificial sweeteners, in urban groundwater and their suitability as tracers to inform urban water management. In this study, pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners were monitored over 6 years in a shallow urban groundwater body along with a range of conventional sewage tracers in a network of observation wells that were specifically constructed to assess sewer leakage. Out of the 71 substances screened, 24 were detected at above the analytical detection limit. The most frequent compounds were the iodinated X-ray contrast medium amidotrizoic acid (35.3%), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (33.3%) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (27.5%), while all other substances occurred in less than 10% of the screened wells. The results from the group of specifically constructed focus wells within 10 m of defective sewers confirmed sewer leaks as being a major entrance pathway into the groundwater. The spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals and artificial sweeteners corresponds well with predictions by pipeline leakage models, which operate on optical sewer condition monitoring data and hydraulic information. Correlations between the concentrations of carbamazepine. iodinated X-ray contrast media and artificial sweeteners were weak to non-existent. Peak concentrations of up to 4130 ng/l of amidotrizoic acid were found in the groundwater downstream of the local hospital. The analysis of 168 samples for amidotrizoic acid, taken at 5 different occasions, did not show significant temporal trends for the years 2002-2008, despite changed recommendations in the medical usage of amidotrizoic acid. The detailed results show that the current mass balance approaches for urban groundwater bodies must be adapted to reflect the spatially distributed leaks and the variable wastewater composition in addition to the lateral and horizontal groundwater fluxes.

AB A study was conducted in an area in north. Italy, on the effluent of two different sized hospitals and the influent and effluent of the receiving municipal treatment plant of one of the examined hospitals. The aim was to investigate 73 selected pharmaceuticals, belonging to twelve different classes, comparing their occurrence in the effluent directly exiting the hospital with that, mixed with the local urban effluent, at the point of its entry and exit from the treatment plant.
   Consistent differences were found in the concentrations of some antibiotics, analgesics and lipid regulators in the two wastewaters, confirming that hospital effluents should not be considered as possessing the same pollutant nature as urban wastewater. Furthermore, analysis of percentage contributions of the hospital to the treatment plant influent evidences that hospitals represent one of the main sources of pollutants, in particular antibiotics, receptor antagonists and lipid regulators.
   Hence, an environmental risk assessment, performed on the effluent from the hospital and the influent and effluent from the treatment plant, revealed a high risk for 9 pharmaceuticals in hospital effluent and for 4 of the 9 substances in the treatment plant influent and effluent, with antibiotics being the most critical compounds in terms of contribution and potential environmental risk for the hospital.

AB The pilot-scale solar degradation of trimethoprim (TMP) in different water matrices (demineralized water: DW, simulated natural freshwater: SW; simulated wastewater: SWW; and real effluent: RE) was investigated in this study. DOC removal was lower in the case of SW compared to DW, which can be attributed to the presence of inorganic anions which may act as scavengers of the HO center dot. Furthermore, the presence of organic carbon and higher salt content in SWW and RE led to lower mineralization per dose of hydrogen peroxide compared to DW and SW. Toxicity assays in SWW and RE were also performed indicating that toxicity is attributed to the compounds present in RE and their by-products formed during solar Fenton treatment and not to the intermediates formed by the oxidation of TMP. A large number of compounds generated by the photocatalytic transformation of TMP were identified by UPLC-QToF/MS. The degradation pathway revealed differences among the four matrices; however hydroxylation, demethylation and cleavage reactions were observed in all matrices. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that TMP degradation products have been identified by adopting a solar Fenton process at a pilot-scale set-up, using four different aqueous matrices.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR), is an ionizable and polar antimicrobial compound, and it may enter the environment in substantial amounts via the application of manure or sewage as a fertilizer. Sorption of NOR onto humic acid (HA) may affect its environmental fate. In this study, HA extracted from weathered coal was used to investigate the sorption of NOR at different solution chemistry conditions (pH, ionic strength) and temperatures. The sorption of NOR onto HA showed a two-stage sorption process with an equilibration time of 48 h. The sorption kinetic curve fitted well with a pseudo second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic characteristics demonstrated that the sorption of NOR onto HA was a spontaneous and exothermic process predominated by physical sorption. All sorption isotherms fitted well with the Freundlich and Langmuir models and they were highly nonlinear with values of n between 0.4 and 0.5, suggesting the high heterogeneity of HA. Increasing Ca2+ concentration resulted in a considerable reduction in the K-d values of NOR, hinting that Ca2+ had probably competed with NOR+,0 for the cation exchange sites on the surfaces of HA. The sorption reached a maximum at pH 6.0 over the pH range of 2.0-8.0, implying that the primary sorption mechanism was cation exchange interaction between NOR+,0 species and the negatively charged functional groups of HA. Spectroscopic evidence demonstrated that the piperazinyl moiety of NOR was responsible for sorption onto HA, while the carbonyl group and the aromatic structure of HA participated in adsorbing NOR.

AB Human pharmaceutical drugs have been found in surface waters worldwide, and represent an increasing concern since little is known about their possible effects on wildlife. Propranolol is a common beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (B-blocker) typically prescribed to people suffering from heart disease and hypertension. Propranolol has been detected in United States wastewater effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.026 to 1.90 mu g/l. In mammals, there is evidence that beta-blockers can cause sexual dysfunction, and alter serotonergic pathways which may impact reproductive behavior but little is known about the effects on fish behavior. The present study tested the effects of propranolol on fecundity, on brain gene expression and on reproductive behavior of the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, a fish that exhibits male parental care. Sexually mature fathead minnows were housed at a ratio of one male and two females per tank and exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10 mu g/l for 21 days. Measured concentrations (+/- SD) of propranolol were 0.003 +/- 0.004, 0.05 +/- 0.02, 0.88 +/- 0.34 and 4.11 +/- 1.19 mu g/l. There were no statistically significant differences in fecundity, fertilization rate, hatchability and time to hatch. Propranolol exposure was not associated with a change in nest rubbing behavior, time spent in the nest or approaching the females. There was a significant difference in the number of visits to the nest with males receiving low and medium propranolol treatments. The microarray analysis showed that there were 335 genes up-regulated and 400 genes down-regulated in the brain after exposure to the highest dose of propranolol. Among those genes, myoglobin and calsequestrin transcripts (fold change=10.84 and 5.49, respectively) were highly up-regulated. Ontological analyses indicated changes in genes involved in calcium ion transport, transcription, proteolysis and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. Pathway analysis indicated that the reduced expression of caspases may lead to impaired neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter secretion and brain function in developing organisms. The results showed that exposure to propranolol at concentrations as high as 4.11 mu g/l did not significantly impact reproductive behavior or spawning abilities of fathead minnow but did alter the regulation of genes within the brain of fish.

AB Recent studies have shown that 1H-benzotriazole is a widespread contaminant of wastewater and surface water. Although disinfection by ozone has been shown to efficiently remove this compound, the transformation products have not been identified. To that end, the reaction of ozone with 1H-benzotriazole in aqueous solution has been studied in real time employing quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS) and negative electrospray ionization. The transformation products have been identified by calculating their empirical formulas using accurate mass measurements, and further confirmed by performing the reaction with stable isotope-labeled 1H-benzotriazole and measuring product ion spectra. Stable reaction products were distinguished from transient species by plotting their extracted mass profiles. The products that resulted from ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the reaction were qualitatively identified by modifying the conditions to either promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals, or to scavenge them. Based on experimental evidence, a mechanism for the direct reaction between ozone and 1H-benzotriazole is proposed that results in the formation of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarbaldehyde, which has an empirical formula of C4H3O2N3. Lastly, it was confirmed that the same transformation products formed in surface water and tertiary-treated wastewater, although they were observed to degrade at higher ozone doses.

AB Caffeine, a biologically active drug, is recognized as a contaminant of freshwater and marine systems. We quantified caffeine concentrations in Oregon's coastal ocean to determine whether levels correlated with proximity to caffeine pollution sources. Caffeine was analyzed at 14 coastal locations, stratified between populated areas with sources of caffeine pollution and sparsely populated areas with no major caffeine pollution sources. Caffeine concentrations were measured in major water bodies discharging near sampling locations. Caffeine in seawater ranged from below the reporting limit (8.5 ng/L) to 44.7 ng/L. Caffeine occurrence and concentrations in seawater did not correspond with pollution threats from population density and point and non-point sources, but did correspond with storm event occurrence. Caffeine concentrations in rivers and estuaries draining to the coast ranged from below the reporting limit to 152.2 ng/L. This study establishes the occurrence of caffeine in Oregon's coastal waters, yet relative importance of sources, seasonal variability, and processes affecting caffeine transport into the coastal ocean require further research.

AB Psychoactive compounds-meprobamate, pyrithyldione, primidone, and its metabolites, phenobarbital, and phenylethylmalonamide-were detected in groundwater within the catchment area of a drinking water treatment plant located downgradient of a former sewage farm in Berlin, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of the psychoactive compounds in anoxic groundwater and to assess the risk of drinking water contamination. Groundwater age was determined to achieve a better understanding of present hydrogeological conditions.
   A large number of observation and production wells were sampled. Samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Groundwater age was estimated using the helium-tritium (He-3-H-3) dating method.
   Concentrations of psychoactive compounds up to 1 mu g/L were encountered in the contamination plume. Generally, concentrations of phenobarbital and meprobamate were the highest. Elevated concentrations of the analytes were also detected in raw water from abstraction wells located approximately 2.5 km downgradient of the former sewage farm. Concentrations in the final drinking water were below the limit of quantification owing to dilution. The age of shallow groundwater samples ranged from years to a decade, whereas groundwater was up to four decades old at 40 m below ground. Concentrations of the compounds increased with groundwater age.
   Elevated concentrations of psychoactive drugs indicate a strong persistence of these compounds in the environment under anoxic aquifer conditions. Results suggest that the heritage of sewage irrigation will affect raw water quality in the area for decades. Therefore, further monitoring of raw and final drinking water is recommended to ensure that contaminant concentrations remain below the health-based precautionary value.

AB Due to its resistance to many wastewater treatment processes, the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) is routinely found in wastewater effluent. Wastewater irrigation is an alternative to stream discharge of wastewater effluent, which utilizes the soil as a tertiary filter to remove excess nutrients and has the potential to remove pharmaceutical compounds. Previous data suggest that CBZ is strongly sorbed to soil; however, it is unknown what its fate is for long periods of irrigation and if land use affects its distribution. Therefore, the objectives of our research were to characterize CBZ concentrations in soils that have been receiving wastewater irrigation for >25 yr under three different land uses: cropped, grassed, and forested. Triplicate soil cores were collected at each of the land uses to a depth of 120 cm. Extractions for CBZ were performed using 5-g soil samples and 20 mL of acetonitrile. The extracted solutions were analyzed on a liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer. The samples were also analyzed for supporting information such as organic carbon, pH, and electrical conductivity. Results suggest that there is accumulation of the CBZ in the surface soils, which have the highest organic carbon content. Average concentrations of CBZ in the surface soils were 4.92, 2.9, and 1.92 ng g(-1), for the forested, grassed, and cropped land uses, respectively. The majority of the CBZ was found in the upper 30 cm of the profile. Our results suggest that the soils adsorb CBZ and slow its movement into groundwater, compared to the movement of nonadsorbed chemicals.

AB Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are two common antimicrobial agents found in many personal care products and subsequently are detected ubiquitously in wastewater effluent and receiving waters. Both compounds are of recent regulatory interest due to their omnipresence in the environment, including in humans. Although TCS and TCC have been suggested to be endocrine active, little information exists about their effects on organismal end points in development (growth, escape performance), anatomy (morphological indices, histology), physiology (vitellogenin), and behavior of exposed aquatic organisms. In this study, newly hatched fathead minnows were exposed for 12 days, and mature male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 21 days to environmentally realistic concentrations (nanograms per liter) of these two compounds singularly and in mixtures. At the end of the exposure, larvae were assessed for growth and predator-avoidance performance, and a subset of mature fish was assessed for plasma vitellogenin induction, expression of secondary sexual characteristics, relative size of liver and gonads, and histopathological changes to both organs. The remaining exposed mature fish were placed in breeding pairs of one male and one female minnow from the same treatment to assess their ability to defend a nest site and reproduce. Exposure to either antimicrobial compound, alone or as a mixture, caused no changes to larval fish, gonad size, or vitellogenin concentrations in mature fathead minnows. In contrast, decreased aggression was seen in adult male fathead minnows exposed to TCC (1.6 mu g/l) or a mixture (560 ng/l TCS + 179 ng/l TCC and 1.6 mu g/l TCS + 450 ng/l TCC). Decreased aggression would likely decrease their ability to defend and hold a nest site needed for spawning and reproduction. Substantial variability was found in the severity of observed effects within treatments, suggesting that environmentally realistic concentrations of these compounds may only affect particularly sensitive individuals.

AB Pharmaceuticals are bioactive compounds generally resistant to biodegradation, which can make them problematic when they are released into nature. The use pattern for pharmaceuticals means that they are discharged into water via sewage treatment plants. Also surfactants are discharged through sewage treatment plants, primarily due to their use in detergents and shampoos and other cleaners. In this study the acute toxicity to Daphnia magna of four pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, paracetamol and zinc pyrithione) and seven surfactants (C8 alkyl glucoside, C6 alkyl glucoside, sodium caprylimidiopropionate, tallow-trimethyl-ammonium chloride, potassium decylphosphate, propylheptanol ethoxylate and alkylmonoethanolamide ethoxylate) was determined. Abiotic (without activated sludge bacteria) and biotic (with activated sludge bacteria) detoxification was also determined. The 24-h EC50s ranged from 2 mu g L-1 for the most toxic substance (zinc pyrithione) to 2 g L-1 for the least toxic compound (C6 alkyl glucoside). Detoxification rates determined as the ratio between initial EC50 and EC50 after 1 week in water with activated sludge bacteria ranged from 0.4 (paracetamol) to 13 (zinc pyrithione). For most of these chemicals detoxification rate decreased after 1 week, but for one (alkylmonoethanolamide ethoxylate) it increased from about 2 to 30 times after 2 weeks. Many of these chemicals were "detoxified" also abiotically at about the same rate as biotically. Further studies are needed to determine the degradation products that were precipitated (aggregated) for some of the tested chemicals. Altogether, this study has shown that there are large differences in toxicity among chemicals entering sewage treatment plants, but also that the detoxification of them can differ. Therefore, the detoxification should receive more attention in the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals entering sewage treatment plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, attention has been drawn toward the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. In recent years, many reports have been made on the occurrence of the large, differentiated group of pharmaceuticals in wastewater (PW), surface water, ground water, and in soil. The pharmaceutical sector is currently expanding in Tunisia, with more than 34 industries. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 to treat PW. P. putida was very efficient in reducing chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity of solution (85.5, 89.1, and 81.5%, respectively). Genotoxicity of effluent, before and after biodegradation, was evaluated in vivo in mouse bone marrow by assessing the percentage of cells bearing different chromosome aberrations. Results indicated that PW showed a significant ability to induce DNA damage. In addition, PW induced a remarkable lipid peroxidation (LPO) effect, however, activities of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were unchanged when treated with PW, compared to nontreated PW. This toxicity was imputed to the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater. However, chromosome aberration, as well as LPO of PW, were significantly reduced after bioremediation. Thus, the use of this strain for testing on the industrial scale seems possible and advantageous.

AB A SPE-UHPLC-UV method for the determination of 13 pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups in surface water and wastewater samples was proposed. The following three solid-phase-extraction (SPE) columns with polymeric sorbents were used as a pre-concentration step: the Oasis HLB (average recoveries 93.8 %), the Nexus (84.0 %) and the Bond Elut ENV (88.3 %). A reverse-phase UHPLC with a C-18e monolithic column and gradient elution program was used to obtain the best separations for all 13 drugs in short analysis time (3.4 min). The LOD range for determined drugs was 0.02-0.18 mu g L-1, and the concentration range for drugs found in water samples was 0.06-0.90 mu g L-1. The proposed method was used to analyze different water samples, mostly from rivers, and can be used as a monitoring tool for environmental pollution.

AB BACKGROUND: The antibiotics in industrial and munipical wastewaters could not be removed effectively in conventional anaerobic and aerobic biological treatment plants. Few studies have been performed to investigate the biodegradation and inhibition kinetics of oxytetracycline (OTC) on methanogens and total volatile fatty acids (TVFA). RESULTS: A high rate anaerobic multichamber bed reactor (AMCBR) was effective in removing the molasses-chemical oxygen demand (COD), and the OTC antibiotic with yields as high as 96% at an influent OTC loading rate of 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1 at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.25 days. Increasing the OTC loading rates from 22.22 gOTC m-3 day-1 to 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1 improved both hydrolysis and specific utilization of molasses-COD. The inhibition constants of TVFA (KI-TVFA-meth) and OTC (KI-OTC-meth) on methanogens decreased at OTC loadings > 133.33 gOTC m-3 day-1. The direct effect of OTC loadings > 133.3 gOTC m-3 day-1 on acidogens and methanogens was evaluated using the Haldane inhibition kinetic. CONCLUSION: OTC antibiotic was effectively removed in a sequential AMCBR/completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The Haldane inhibition constant (KID) decreased significantly at high OTC loads indicating the increase in toxicity. Copyright (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry

   Results showed that the plant promoted the removal of 94% and 75% of ENR and TET, respectively, from wastewater. Microbial abundance estimation revealed that microorganisms were not a major participant. Occurrence of drugs adsorption to plant roots was observed in small extension. Therefore, main mechanisms occurring were drug removal by plant uptake and/or degradation. Present results demonstrated the potential of P. australis-planted beds to be used for removal of pharmaceuticals from livestock and slaughterhouse industries wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Constructed wetlands are a potential method for the removal of two pharmaceutical and personal care products from wastewater effluent. Triclosan (TCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]phenol) and triclocarban (TCC; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanillide) are antimicrobial agents added to a variety of consumer products whose accumulation patterns in constructed wetlands are poorly understood. Here, we report the accumulation of TCS, its metabolite methyl-triclosan (MTCS; 5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]), and TCC in wet-land plant tissues and sediments. Three wetland macrophytes: Typha latifolia, Pontederia cordata, and Sagittaria graminea were sampled from a constructed wetland in Denton, Texas, USA. MTCS concentrations were below the method detection limit (MDL) for all species. TCS root tissue concentrations in T. latifolia were significantly greater than root concentrations in P. cordata (mean SE in ng g(-1): 40.3 +/- 11.3 vs. 15.0 +/- 1.9, respectively), while for TCC, shoot tissue concentrations in S. graminea were significantly greater than in T. latifolia (22.8 +/- 9.3 vs. 9.0 (MDL), respectively). For both TCS and TCC, T. latifolia root tissue concentrations were significantly greater than shoot concentrations (TCS: 40.3 +/- 11.3 vs. 17.2 +/- 0.2, TCC: 26.0 +/- 3.6 vs. 9.0, (MDL)). TCC concentrations in P. cordata roots were significantly greater than in shoots (34.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 15.4 +/- 2.8, respectively). TCS concentrations in T. latifolia roots and sediments and TCC concentrations in sediments generally decreased from wetland inflow to outflow. To our knowledge, this is the first study documenting species and tissue specific differences in the accumulation of TCS and TCC in plants from an operational constructed wetland. The species specific differences in bioaccumulation suggest TCS and TCC removal from constructed wetlands could be enhanced through targeted plantings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorption of atenolol on granular activated carbon in a fixed bed column was investigated. This micropollutant was effectively adsorbed onto the activated carbon; therefore, the effect of some operation parameters on the performance of the breakthrough curve was studied. Some adsorption parameters, as the adsorption capacities at breakthrough and saturation time, the length of the mass transfer zone (mtz) and the fractional bed utilization were estimated. Four kinetic models, including Adams-Bohart, Wolborska, Thomas, and Yoon-Nelson model, were used to determine the adsorption parameters and to predict the breakthrough curves. Among all examined models, Thomas and Yoon-Nelson were found to be the most suitable for simulation of the breakthrough curve of atenolol uptake on granular activated carbon fixed bed column.

AB Occurrence, removal, consumption and environmental risks of sixteen antibiotics were investigated in several sewage treatment plants (STPs) featuring different treatment levels in Hong Kong, China. Cefalexin, ofloxacin and erythromycin-H2O were predominant with concentrations of 1020-5640, 142-7900 and 243-4740 ng/L in influent, respectively; their mass loads were comparable to levels reported in urban regions in China and were at the high end of the range reported for western countries. The target antibiotics behaved differently depending on the treatment level employed at the STPs and relatively higher removal efficiencies (>70%) were observed for cefalexin. cefotaxime, amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol during secondary treatment. beta-lactams were especially susceptible to removal via the activated sludge process while macrolides were recalcitrant (<20%) in the dissolved phase. Two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin (4%) and norfloxacin (52%), differed greatly in their removal efficiencies, probably because of disparities in their pk(a), values which resulted in different sorption behaviour in sludge. Overall antibiotic consumption in Hong Kong was back-calculated based on influent mass flows and compared with available prescription and usage data. This model was verified by a good approximation of 82% and 141% to the predicted consumption of total ofloxacin, but a less accurate estimate was obtained for erythromycin usage. Risk assessment indicated that algae are susceptible to the environmental concentrations of amoxicillin as well as the mixture of the nine detected antibiotics in receiving surface waters.

AB The present study aims to investigate the individual and combined effects of temperature, pH, zero-valent bimetallic nanoparticles (ZVBMNPs) dose, and chloramphenicol (CP) concentration on the reductive degradation of CP using ZVBMNPs in aqueous medium.
   Iron-silver ZVBMNPs were synthesized. Batch experimental data were generated using a four-factor statistical experimental design. CP reduction by ZVBMNPs was optimized using the response surface modeling (RSM) and artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) approaches. The RSM and ANN methodologies were also compared for their predictive and generalization abilities using the same training and validation data set. Reductive by-products of CP were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique.
   The optimized process variables (RSM and ANN-GA approaches) yielded CP reduction capacity of 57.37 and 57.10 mg g(-1), respectively, as compared to the experimental value of 54.0 mg g(-1) with un-optimized variables. The ANN-GA and RSM methodologies yielded comparable results and helped to achieve a higher reduction (> 6%) of CP by the ZVBMNPs as compared to the experimental value. The root mean squared error, relative standard error of prediction and correlation coefficient between the measured and model-predicted values of response variable were 1.34, 3.79, and 0.964 for RSM and 0.03, 0.07, and 0.999 for ANN models for the training and 1.39, 3.47, and 0.996 for RSM and 1.25, 3.11, and 0.990 for ANN models for the validation set.
   Predictive and generalization abilities of both the RSM and ANN models were comparable. The synthesized ZVBMNPs may be used for an efficient reductive removal of CP from the water.

AB We analyzed and compared the distributions of 13 target pharmaceuticals in different water samples from the Hangzhou metropolitan area and Linan County, Southeast China.
   Sampling was conducted in five hospitals, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and Qiantang River. Samples were concentrated by solid-phase extraction and PPCP concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS/MS.
   Trimethoprim, erythromycin A dihydrate, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, diclofenac sodium, and atenolol were the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in hospital effluents. Most of the pharmaceutical concentrations in hospital effluents were higher than those in the WWTP influents. Although both WWTPs adopt the anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic treatment process, the removal rates for pharmaceuticals, such as trimethoprim and diclofenac sodium, were completely different. Meanwhile, erythromycin A dihydrate, ofloxacin, penicillin-G, cephalexin, cefazolin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac sodium were detected in Qiantang River.
   These results indicate that hospitals are more concentrated sources of pharmaceuticals than WWTPs, and the WWTPs are not the only route of entry of pharmaceuticals into aquatic environments in these two regions.

AB In the present investigation, the most commonly used pharmaceutical drug Ibuprofen (IB) was exposed to an Indian major carp Cirrhinus mrigala under static bioassay method to estimate its toxicological effects for a period of 35 days. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) of IB to the fish C. mrigala for 24h was found to be 142 ppm. In sublethal treatment (1/10th of LC 50 24h value, 14.2 ppm), a significant decrease in erythrocyte (RBC), mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and plasma protein levels were observed throughout the study period when compare to that of their respective controls. In contrast, haemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean cellular volume (MCV), mean cellular hemoglobin (MCH), leucocyte (WBC), plasma glucose and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were increased in this study period. On the other hand, a mixed trend was noticed in aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) enzyme activity. Alterations of these parameters can be effectively used as potential biomarkers in monitoring of IB toxicity in the aquatic organisms. However, more detailed studies on these specific biomarkers are needed to assess the impacts of human pharmaceutical drugs in the field of pharmacotoxicology and aquatic toxicology.

TI Predicting concentrations of trace organic compounds in municipal
   wastewater treatment plant sludge and biosolids using the PhATE (TM)
   model
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents the capability expansion of the PhATE (TM) (pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation) model to predict concentrations of trace organics in sludges and biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). PhATE was originally developed as an empirical model to estimate potential concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in US surface and drinking waters that could result from patient use of medicines. However, many compounds, including pharmaceuticals, are not completely transformed in WWTPs and remain in biosolids that may be applied to land as a soil amendment. This practice leads to concerns about potential exposures of people who may come into contact with amended soils and also about potential effects to plants and animals living in or contacting such soils. The model estimates the mass of API in WWTP influent based on the population served, the API per capita use, and the potential loss of the compound associated with human use (e.g., metabolism). The mass of API on the treated biosolids is then estimated based on partitioning to primary and secondary solids, potential loss due to biodegradation in secondary treatment (e.g., activated sludge), and potential loss during sludge treatment (e.g., aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion, composting). Simulations using 2 surrogate compounds show that predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) generated by PhATE are in very good agreement with measured concentrations, i.e., well within 1 order of magnitude. Model simulations were then carried out for 18 APIs representing a broad range of chemical and use characteristics. These simulations yielded 4 categories of results: 1) PECs are in good agreement with measured data for 9 compounds with high analytical detection frequencies, 2) PECs are greater than measured data for 3 compounds with high analytical detection frequencies, possibly as a result of as yet unidentified depletion mechanisms, 3) PECs are less than analytical reporting limits for 5 compounds with low analytical detection frequencies, and 4) the PEC is greater than the analytical method reporting limit for 1 compound with a low analytical detection frequency, possibly again as a result of insufficient depletion data. Overall, these results demonstrate that PhATE has the potential to be a very useful tool in the evaluation of APIs in biosolids. Possible applications include: prioritizing APIs for assessment even in the absence of analytical methods; evaluating sludge processing scenarios to explore potential mitigation approaches; using in risk assessments; and developing realistic nationwide concentrations, because PECs can be represented as a cumulative probability distribution. Finally, comparison of PECs to measured concentrations can also be used to identify the need for fate studies of compounds of interest in biosolids. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2012; 8: 530542.

AB An important beneficial reuse of treated wastewater (recycled water) in arid and semiarid regions is landscape irrigation. However, the environmental fate, especially groundwater contamination potential, of trace contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is a significant concern that can hinder the acceptance and adoption of such reuses. In this study, we irrigated mature turfgrass plots with nonspiked tertiary treated wastewater for over 6 mo at 100 or 130% of the reference evapotranspiration rate (ETo) and collected leachate water at the 90-cm depth on a weekly basis. In the recycled water, all 14 target PPCPs were consistently found, and the mean levels of atenolol, gemfibrozil, meprobamate, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole were above 100 ng L-1. However, only five compounds were detected in the leachate at trace levels. Trimethoprim and primidone were frequently found, whereas the detection of sulfamethoxazole, meprobamate and carbamazepine was less frequent (<50%). When detected, the overall mean concentration in the leachate was 10.2 ng L-1 for trimethoprim, 7.1 ng L-1 for primidone, and 2.9 to 12.4 ng L-1 for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and meprobamate. The majority of the target PPCPs were completely removed. Given that the irrigation rates were higher than normal, this study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of turfgrass systems in attenuating PPCPs during recycled water irrigation. However, it is also apparent that some PPCPs are more susceptible to leaching than others, and these PPCPs thus merit further research attention.

AB The pharmaceutical residues in waste water from the largest sewage treatment plant (SIP) in Northern Taiwan and in seawater around the effluent discharged area were determined. An environmental risk assessment for the marine environment was conducted based on the environment risk quotient (ERQ). The concentrations of the analyzed compounds in SIP influent and effluent were generally higher than those found in coastal seawater. Relatively higher values were found at the estuarine mouth and the discharged area, suggesting that the SIP effluent is a point source. The removal efficiency and half life of the analyzed compounds were 6.3-46.8% and 3-18 days, respectively. The ERQ value theoretical calculation was generally greater than 1. However, when the measured concentrations replaced the predicated concentrations, the ERQ values were considerably lower than 1. Therefore, our results call for a re-evaluation of the risks posed by pharmaceuticals to coastal marine ecosystems in Northern Taiwan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recalcitrant compounds in pharmaceutical wastewaters render biological treatment inadequate. Conventional Fenton technology, though a promising alternative, suffers from high sludge generation. In this study, fluidized-bed (FB) Fenton process, an improvement of traditional Fenton method, was used to decompose acetaminophen (ACT) from aqueous solutions. Optimization of important parameters: initial pH, ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide dosages, was carried out using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). Effects of all factors and their interactions on ACT decomposition were significant. At optimum operating conditions, ACT degradation reached 97.8% while iron removal of 62.92% was achieved. In addition, the high hydrogen peroxide efficiencies of FB-Fenton process with respect to ACT degradation and COD removal make this technology a cost-effective option in treating acetaminophen-contaminated wastewaters.

AB Tertiary wastewater treatment plant effluent before and after zonation (0.6-1.1 g O-3/g DOC) was tested for aquatic ecotoxicity in a battery of standardised microbioassays with green algae, daphnids, and zebrafish eggs. In addition, unconjugated estrogen and 17 beta-hydroxyandrogen immunoreactive substances were quantified by means of enzyme immunoassays, and endocrine effects were analysed in a 21-day fish screening assay with adult male and female medaka (Oryzias latipes). Ozonation decreased estrogen-immunoreactivity by 97.7 +/- 1.2% and, to a lesser extent, androgen-immunoreactivity by 56.3 +/- 16.5%. None of the short-term exposure ecotoxicity tests revealed any adverse effects of the tertiary effluent, neither before nor after the ozonation step. Similarly in the fish screening assay, reproductive fitness parameters showed no effects attributed to micropollutants, and no detrimental effects of the effluents were observed. Based on the presented screening, zonation effectively reduced steroid hormone levels in the wastewater treatment plant effluent without increasing the effluent's ecotoxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work makes a comparison between electrocoagulation (EC), photoelectrocoagulation, peroxi-electrocoagulation and peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation processes to investigate the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from pharmaceutical wastewater. The effects of operational parameters such as initial pH, current density, applied voltage, amount of hydrogen peroxide and electrolysis time on COD removal efficiency were investigated and the optimum operating range for each of these operating variables was experimentally determined. In electrocoagulation process, the optimum values of pH and voltage were determined to be 7 and 40V, respectively. Desired pH and hydrogen peroxide concentration in the Fenton-based processes were found to be 3 and 300 mg/L, respectively. The amounts of COD, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature and total dissolved solids (TDS) were on-line monitored.
   Results indicated that under the optimum operating range for each process, the COD removal efficiency was in order of peroxi-electrocoagulation > peroxi-photoelectrocoagulation > photoelectrocoagulation > electrocoagulation. Finally, a kinetic study was carried out using the linear pseudo-second-order model and results showed that the pseudo-second-order equation provided the best correlation for the COD removal rate.

AB Effluents from sewage treatment plants contain a mixture of micropollutants with the potential of harming aquatic organisms. Thus, addition of advanced treatment techniques to complement existing conventional methods has been proposed. Some of the advanced techniques could, however, potentially produce additional compounds affecting exposed organisms by unknown modes of action. In the present study the aim was to improve our understanding of how exposure to different sewage effluents affects fish. This was achieved by explorative microarray and quantitative PCR analyses of hepatic gene expression, as well as relative organ sizes of rainbow trout exposed to different sewage effluents (conventionally treated, granular activated carbon, zonation (5 or 15 mg/L), 5 mg/L ozone plus a moving bed biofilm reactor, or UV-light treatment in combination with hydrogen peroxide). Exposure to the conventionally treated effluent caused a significant increase in liver and heart somatic indexes, an effect removed by all other treatments. Genes connected to xenobiotic metabolism, including cytochrome p450 1A, were differentially expressed in the fish exposed to the conventionally treated effluents, though only effluent treatment with granular activated carbon or ozone at 15 mg/L completely removed this response. The mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 kDa was induced in all three groups exposed to ozone-treated effluents, suggesting some form of added stress in these fish. The induction of estrogen-responsive genes in the fish exposed to the conventionally treated effluent was effectively reduced by all investigated advanced treatment technologies, although the moving bed biofilm reactor was least efficient. Taken together, granular activated carbon showed the highest potential of reducing responses in fish induced by exposure to sewage effluents. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of solar radiation on the inactivation of multidrug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR) strains selected from an urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluent and the change of their resistance to a mixture of three antibiotics (evaluated in terms of minimum inhibit concentration (MIC)) in wastewater polluted stream were investigated. The solar photodegradation of the mixture of the three target antibiotics (amoxicillin (AMX), ciprofloxacin (CPX), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)) was also evaluated. Additionally, since UWWTP effluents are possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria, the disinfection by conventional chlorination process of the UWWTP effluent inoculated with MDR strains was investigated too. Solar radiation poorly affected the inactivation of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (40 and 60% after 180 min irradiation). Moreover, solar radiation did not affect strain resistance to AMX (MIC > 256 mu g/mL) and SMZ (MIC > 1024 mu g/mL), but affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to CPX (MIC decreased by 33% but only after 180 min of irradiation). Chlorination of wastewater sample strongly decreased the number of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (99.667 and 99.999%), after 60 min of contact time at 2.0 mg/L initial chlorine concentration, but the resistance of survived colonies to antibiotics was unchanged. Finally, the solar photodegradation rate of the antibiotic mixture (1 mg/L initial concentration respectively) resulted in the following order (half-life time): CPX (t(1/2) = 24 min)< AMX (t(1/2) = 99 min)< SMZ (t(1/2) = 577 min). Accordingly, the risk of the development of resistance to SMZ in surface water is significantly higher compared to CPX and AMX. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The site-specific daily fluctuations and scale-dependent variability of influent water quality, particularly concentrations of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs), have not yet been well described. In this study, raw wastewater from three distinct sewershed scales was sampled including a centralized wastewater treatment facility in Boulder, Colorado (population similar to 125,000) and two decentralized wastewater catchments in Golden, Colorado (clustered system population 400, and septic system population 32). Each site was sampled hourly for 26 h and samples were subsequently analyzed in triplicate for 32 TOrCs using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and stable isotope dilution. Detection frequency (DF) of the various TOrCs was positively correlated with sewershed size with the greatest DF of the targeted TOrCs at the Boulder site and with decreasing DF with decreasing sewershed size. Site-specific fluctuations were both scale and compound-specific. The 11 TOrCs detected greater than 75% of the time across all three sites were used to further investigate and quantify variability and to develop a statistical model to investigate the flow-dependence and time-dependence of TOrC variability. Sewershed scale was inversely correlated to variability with coefficients of variation ranging from 0.24 to 0.96, 0.39 to 2.22, and 0.32 to 3.93 for the Boulder, cluster, and septic sites, respectively. A significant linear relationship was observed between concentration and flow and concentration and the concentration at prior time points for most TOrCs at the Boulder site. This suggests less variable influent concentrations result from dispersion and mixing in the conveyance system and a larger number of discrete inputs. A notable exception was the chlorinated flame retardant TCPP, which is likely associated with a high concentration, low-flow industrial input. A significant linear relationship between flow and concentration and sequential time points was not common at the decentralized sites.

AB Photodecomposition might be regarded as one of the most important abiotic factors affecting the fate of UV absorbing compounds in the environment and photocatalysis has been suggested as an effective method to degrade organic pollutants. However. UV filters transformation appears to be a complex process, barely addressed to date. The white rot fungus Trametes versicolor is considered as a promising alternative to conventional aerobic bacterial degradation, as it is able to metabolise a wide range of xenobiotics. This study focused on both degradation processes of two widely used UV filters, benzophenone-3 (BP3) and benzophenone-1 (BP1). Fungal treatment resulted in the degradation of more than 99% for both sunscreens in less than 24 h, whereas photodegradation was very inefficient, especially for BP3, which remained unaltered upon 24 h of simulated sunlight irradiation. Analysis of metabolic compounds generated showed BP1 as a minor by-product of BP3 degradation by T. versicolor while the main intermediate metabolites were glycoconjugate derivatives. BP1 and BP3 showed a weak, but significant estrogenic activity (EC50 values of 0.058 mg/L and 12.5 mg/L, respectively) when tested by recombinant yeast assay (RYA), being BP1 200-folds more estrogenic than BP3. Estrogenic activity was eliminated during T. versicolor degradation of both compounds, showing that none of the resulting metabolites possessed significant estrogenic activity at the concentrations produced. These results demonstrate the suitability of this method to degrade both sunscreen agents and to eliminate estrogenic activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Gram-negative benzoic acid degrading bacterial strain Bz was isolated from the wastewater treatment plant of Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in Zibo city, China. It could utilize benzoic acid as the sole carbon and energy source for growth. Under the optimum temperature of 30 degrees C and pH value of 7.5, the benzoic acid degradation rate reached 94% in the basal medium in 96 h. Besides, it could utilize salicylic acid or phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. Physiological and biochemical experiments revealed that the bacterium shared common characters with Pseudomoas putida not only in cytochrome oxidase positive, but also in the substrates assimilation profile tested. These properties supported the bacterium to be a member of P. putida. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene of the bacterium was obtained and sequenced (JN542509). The resulting phylogenetic analysis, based on the sequence and the relatives indicated that the bacterium shared 98 to 99% homologies with the members of P. putida. Therefore, strain Bz was identified to be a member of P. putida. This study presented valuable resources for the biodegradation and biotreatment of aromatic waste.

AB Idiopathic autism, caused by genetic susceptibility interacting with unknown environmental triggers, has increased dramatically in the past 25 years. Identifying environmental triggers has been difficult due to poorly understood pathophysiology and subjective definitions of autism. The use of antidepressants by pregnant women has been associated with autism. These and other unmetabolized psychoactive pharmaceuticals (UPPs) have also been found in drinking water from surface sources, providing another possible exposure route and raising questions about human health consequences. Here, we examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine, venlafaxine & carbamazepine) in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations. We conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three. We used gene-class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders. Only sets associated with idiopathic autism were unambiguously enriched. We found that UPPs induce autism-like gene expression patterns in fish. Our findings suggest a new potential trigger for idiopathic autism in genetically susceptible individuals involving an overlooked source of environmental contamination.

AB Carbamazepine is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater effluents due to its resistance to biodegradation-based conventional treatment. Advanced oxidation can efficiently degrade carbamazepine, but the toxicity and persistence of the oxidation products may be more relevant than the parent. This study sets out to determine whether the products of advanced oxidation of carbamazepine can be biotransformed and ultimately mineralized by developing a novel methodology to assess these sequential treatment processes. The methodology traces the transformation products of the C-14-labeled carbamazepine during UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation and subsequent biotransformation by mixed, undefined cultures using liquid scintillation counting and liquid chromatography with radioactivity, mass spectrometry, and UV detectors. The results show that the oxidation byproducts of carbamazepine containing a hydroxyl or carbonyl group can be fully mineralized by a mixed bacterial inoculum. A tertiary treatment approach that includes oxidation and biotransformation has the potential to synergistically mineralize persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plant effluents. The methodology developed for this study can be applied to assess the mineralization potential of other persistent organic contaminants.

AB Polyelectrolytes have proven their advantages as draw solutes in forward osmosis process in terms of high water flux, minimum reverse flux, and ease of recovery. In this work, the concept of a polyelectrolyte-promoted forward osmosis-membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system was demonstrated and applied to recycle the wastewater containing an acid dye. A poly(acrylic acid) sodium (PAA-Na) salt was used as the draw solute of the FO to dehydrate the wastewater, while the MD was employed to reconcentrate the PAA-Na draw solution. With the integration of these two processes, a continuous wastewater treatment process was established. To optimize the FO-MD hybrid process, the effects of PAA-Na concentration, experimental duration, and temperature were investigated. Almost a complete rejection of PAA-Na solute was observed by both FO and MD membranes. Under the conditions of 0.48 g mL(-1) PAA-Na and 66 degrees C, the wastewater was most efficiently dehydrated yet with a stabilized PAA-Na concentration around 0.48 g mL(-1). The practicality of PAA-Na-promoted FO-MD hybrid technology demonstrates not only its suitability in wastewater reclamation, but also its potential in other membrane-based separations, such as protein or pharmaceutical product enrichment. This study may provide the insights of exploring novel draw solutes and their applications in FO related processes.

AB Fish in many surface freshwaters are exposed to a range of pharmaceuticals via wastewater treatment works effluent discharges. In mammals the pregnane X receptor (PXR) plays a key role in the regulation of a suite of genes involved in drug biotransformation, but information on the role of this response pathway in fish is limited. Here we investigated the effects of exposure of carp (Cyprinus carpio) primary hepatocytes to the human PXR agonist rifampicin (RIF) on expression of target genes involved in phase I (cyp2k, cyp3a) and phase II (gst alpha, gst pi) drug metabolism and drug transporters mdr1 and mrp2. RIF induced expression of all target genes measured and the PXR antagonist ketoconazole (KET) inhibited responses of cyp2k and cyp3a. Exposure of the primary carp hepatocytes to the pharmaceuticals ibuprofen (IBU), clotrimazole (CTZ), clofibric acid (CFA) and propranolol (PRP), found responses to IBU and CFA, but not CTZ or PRP. This is in contrast with mammals, where CTZ is a potent PXR-agonist. Collectively our data indicate potential PXR involvement in regulating selected genes involved in drug metabolism in fish, but suggest some divergence in the regulation pathways with those in mammals. The carp primary hepatocyte model serves as a useful system for screening for responses in these target genes involved in drug metabolism.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic pharmaceutical which is commonly found in environmental matrices. It passes through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) almost completely unaffected and has been found to be highly persistent in the environment. The application of sludge in agricultural fields and the use of WWTP effluents for irrigation constitute a potential source of soil contamination. Consequently, the assessment of the interaction between carbamazepine and soils is of crucial importance to understand its fate in the environment. To monitor the sorption behavior of carbamazepine onto agricultural soils, batch equilibrium experiments were performed using soils subjected to distinct long-term fertilizations. In order to follow the adsorption experiments, an UV spectral deconvolution methodology was applied and the results compared with those from micellar electrokinetic chromatography. The results obtained by both methods did not present significant statistical differences at 95% confidence level. Therefore, it was proven that, in the context of adsorption studies, UV spectral deconvolution is a valid alternative to common chromatographic methods, with the major advantage of being a simple and fast procedure. The adsorption of carbamazepine onto the selected soils was satisfactorily described by the Freundlich model. The obtained Freundlich parameters (K-F) (between 1.79 +/- 0.07 and 4.8 +/- 0.2 mg kg(-1) (mg L-1)(-N)) indicate that the adsorption behavior of carbamazepine is dependent on the soil fertilization. Also, it is not extensively sorbed, indicating that carbamazepine present in soils can be a potential source of contamination of surface and ground waters through run-off and infiltration.

AB Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) were used for the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in aqueous solution. The electric discharge was generated either ex situ or in situ directly on the water surface. To maintain the same ozone concentration of 40 ppm in both instances, the power injected was 0.7W in the ex situ discharge and 12W in the in situ discharge. The results showed 100% CBZ removal after 3 min of treatment with the ex situ discharge, while the in situ discharge only removed 81% of the CBZ after 60 min. According to measurements of UV absorbance at 285 nm and 254 nm. and of total organic carbon, the ex situ discharge system also proved to be more effective than the in situ system. The measurement of nitrogen oxides in both gaseous and liquid phases indicated that high energy in situ discharges produced a large amount of NOx. These species contributed to decreased pH and significantly slowed the CBZ oxidation rate, due to their competition with ozone. Production of NOx should be avoided when using the DBD technique for wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Residue of azole antifungals in the environment is of concern due to the environmental risks and persistence. Distribution, behavior, and fate of frequently used azole antifungal pharmaceuticals were investigated in wastewater at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in China. Fluconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole were constantly detected at 1-1834 ng L-1 in the wastewater. The latter four were also ubiquitously detected in sewage sludge. Fluconazole passed through treatment in the STPs and largely remained in the final effluent. On the contrary, biotransformation and sorption to sludge occurred to the other azoles. Ketoconazole was more readily bio-transformed, whereas clotrimazole, econazole, and miconazole were more likely to be adsorbed onto and persisted in sewage sludge. Lipophilicity plays the governing role on adsorption. The highest concentrations in the raw wastewater were observed in winter for the azole pharmaceuticals except for fluconazole. The seasonal difference was smoothed out after treatment in the STPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are widely distributed in urban wastewaters and can be removed to some extent by constructed wetlands (CWs). The medium-term (3-5 years) behaviour of these systems regarding PPCP removal is still unknown. Seven mesocosm-scale (1 m(2)) CWs of different configurations were operated outdoors for 39 months under the same conditions to assess their PPCP removal ability and temporal evolution. CWs differed in some design parameters, namely plant presence, species chosen (Typha angustifolia vs Phragmites australis), flow configuration and presence/absence of gravel bed (floating macrophytes surface flow, FM-SF; free-water surface flow, FW-SF; free-water subsurface flow, FW-SSF; or conventional horizontal subsurface flow, SSF). PPCP efficiencies decreased throughout time and performance differences among CWs disappeared with the systems aging. This could be due to a homogenization process in the systems caused by detrimental factors like saturation, clogging and shading. Winter efficiencies were lower than summer ones for salicylic acid, caffeine, methyl dihydrojasmonate, galaxolide and tonalide, and seasonal biological activities seem key factors to explain this fact. Maximal removal efficiencies were achieved in an unplanted-FW-SSF for ketoprofen (47-81%), naproxen (58-81%) and salicylic acid (76-98%); in an unplanted-SSF for caffeine (65-99%); in a Phragmites-FM-SF for ibuprofen (49-96%) and diclofenac (16-68%); in a Typha-FM-SF for carbamazepine (35-71%); and in a Typha-FW-SSF for methyl dihydrojasmonate (71-96%), galaxolide (67-82%) and tonalide (55-74%). Photodegradation could be involved in ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac removal. Carbamazepine and diclofenac were moderately removed by the most efficient CWs studied. Carbamazepine might be eliminated by vegetal uptake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extraction and analysis methods have been developed for the detection of the following four antibacterial agents and two natural estrogens in treated municipal wastewater sludge and commercial compost: sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), tetracycline (TET), oxytetracycline (OXY), estrone (E1), and 17 beta-estradiol (E2). The antibiotics and estrogens were extracted from secondary sludge and mixed compost using ultrasonic solvent extraction. Citric acid (pH 4.7) and methanol were used as extraction buffer, followed by tandem-solid-phase extraction cleanup, strong anion exchange + hydrophilic-lipophilic balance for antibiotics and CarboPrep/NAX for estrogens. For quantification, two different methods were employed, using HPLC-MS/MS, with an electrospray ionization source for antibiotics and an atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization source for estrogens. Recoveries were 11-31% for the sulfonamides (SMX and SDM) and tetracyclines (TET and OXY) and 30-59% for the estrogens (E1 and E2) over the entire method. Limits of detection for the extraction method were in the nanogram per gram range for dry weight sludge and compost samples. Neither of the two sulfonamide antibiotics was detected in secondary sludge or mixed compost samples. Estrogens were found in compost in amounts of 160 +/- 65 ng/g (E1) and 21 +/- 3 ng/g (E2), but not in sludge. The tetracyclines, as well as what is believed to be the 4-epimer of OXY, were found in both sludge and compost in amounts of 1.57 +/- 0.67 and 2.95 +/- 0.42 mu g/g (TET), 0.56 +/- 0.12 and 6.51 +/- 0.52 mu g/g (OXY), and 7.60 +/- 1.68 and 1.35 +/- 0.24 mu g/g (4-epi-OXY), respectively. These results indicate that sorption-prone compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and can persist through sludge digestion and that the composting process does not sufficiently eliminate these particular contaminants. Thus, biosolids (even composted) are an additional source of drug residues leaching into the environment, and it must be considered while using biosolids as fertilizer.

AB In the present work, the effectiveness of conventional wastewater treatments (activated sludge and oxidation ditches) and low-cost wastewater treatments (trickling filter beds, anaerobic lagooning and constructed wetlands) in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds has been studied. To evaluate the efficiency of removal, 16 pharmaceutically active compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups (anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, beta-blockers, nervous stimulants, estrogens and lipid regulators) have been monitored during 1-year period in influent and effluent wastewater from 11 wastewater treatment plants of Spain. Mean removal rates of pharmaceutically active compounds achieved in conventional wastewater treatments were slightly higher than those achieved in low-cost treatments, being 64% and 55%, respectively. Ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid and caffeine were the pharmaceutical compounds most efficiently removed, regardless the wastewater treatment applied, with removal rates up to 99%. Anaerobic lagooning was the less effective treatment for the removal of the most persistent compounds: carbamazepine and propranolol.

AB Estrogenic compounds in drinking water sources pose potential threats to human health. Treatment technologies are needed to effectively remove these compounds for the production of safe drinking water. In this study, GAC adsorption was first tested for its ability to remove a model estrogenic compound, 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Although GAC showed a relatively high adsorption capacity for E2 in isotherm experiments, it appeared to have a long mass transfer zone in a GAC column reactor, causing an early leakage of E2 in the effluent. With an influent E2 concentration of 20 mu g/L, the GAC reactor was able to bring down effluent E2 to similar to 200 ng/L. To further enhance E2 removal, the GAC reactor was converted to a biologically active carbon (BAC) reactor by promoting biofilm growth in the reactor. Under optimal operating conditions, the BAC reactor had an effluent E2 concentration of similar to 50 ng/L. With the empty bed contact times tested, the reactor exhibited more robust E2 removal performance under the BAC operation than under the GAC operation. It is noted that estrone (E1), an E2 biodegradation intermediate, was frequently detected in reactor effluent during the BAC operation. Results from this study suggested that BAC could be an effective drinking water treatment process for E2 removal and in the meantime El accumulation needs to be addressed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of micropollutants can be a concern for land application of biosolids. Of particular interest are nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO), nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), and nonylphenol (NP), collectively referred to as NPE, which accumulate in anaerobically digested biosolids and are subject to regulation based on the environmental risks associated with them. Because biosolids are a valuable nutrient resource, it is essential that we understand how various treatment processes impact the fate of NPE in biosolids. Thermal hydrolysis (TH) coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) is an advanced digestion process that destroys pathogens in biosolids and increases methane yields and volatile solids destruction. We investigated the impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on the subsequent biodegradation of NPE in digested biosolids. Biosolids were treated with TH, anaerobic digestion, and aerobic digestion in laboratory-scale reactors, and NPE were analyzed in the influent and effluent of the digesters. NP2EO and NP1EO have been observed to degrade to the more estrogenic NP under anaerobic conditions; therefore, changes in the ratio of NP:NPE were of interest. The increase in NP:NPE following MAD was 56%; the average increase of this ratio in four sets of TH-MAD samples, however, was only 24.6 +/- 3.1%. In addition, TH experiments performed in pure water verified that, during TH, the high temperature and pressure alone did not directly destroy NPE; TH experiments with NP added to sludge also showed that NP was not destroyed by the high temperature and pressure of TH when in a more complex sludge matrix. The post-aerobic digestion phases removed NPE, regardless of whether TH pretreatment occurred. This research indicates that changes in biosolids processing can have impacts beyond just gas production and solids destruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Results reported here highlight the potential and several challenges in the development of a novel osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Following the initial gradual decline, a stable permeate flux value was obtained after approximately four days of continuous operation. There was evidence of continuous deterioration of biological activity of the OMBR system, possibly due to the build-up of salinity in the reactor. The removal of 25 out of 27 trace organic compounds with molecular weight higher than 266 g/mol was above 80% and was possibly governed by the interplay between physical separation of the FO membrane and biodegradation. In contrast, the removal efficiency values of the other 23 trace organic compounds with molecular weight less than 266 g/mol were very scattered. The removal efficiency of these low molecular weight compounds by OMBR treatment appears to depend mostly on biological degradation. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Treated wastewater is being increasingly used for irrigation and aquifer replenishment through artificial recharge. However, wastewater reuse can result in contamination of exposed soil and groundwater by chemicals such as some pharmaceuticals and their metabolites. The fate of these molecules depends largely on their capacity to sorb onto soil and aquifer materials during infiltration. In this study, the sorption isotherm of carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-seizure medication, and two of its metabolites, i.e. carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-EP) and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), were determined in two soils in laboratory assays. In the field, the presence of CBZ and its metabolites were investigated in soil and in groundwater underlying an irrigated area with treated wastewater. The results showed that CBZ had the highest carbon normalised sorption coefficients in the two tested soils (irrigated soil and a Lufa SP2.4 reference soil) followed by CBZ-EP and DiOH-CBZ, indicating the relatively higher mobility of CBZ metabolites compared to CBZ. The chromatographic analysis revealed that CBZ and its two metabolites were present in treated wastewater used for irrigation and in groundwater. In soil samples, CBZ concentrations showed a build-up taking place with irrigation. The mobility of metabolites in soil and their potential biodegradation require further investigation.

AB In conventional sorption studies, the prior presence of contaminants in the soil is not considered when estimating the sorption parameters because this is only a transient state. However, this parameter should be considered in order to avoid the under/overestimation of the soil sorption capacity. In this study, the sorption of naproxen, carbamazepine and triclosan was determined in a wastewater irrigated soil, considering the initial mass of the compounds. Batch sorption-desorption tests were carried out at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 30-40 cm), using either 10 mM CaCl2 solution or untreated wastewater as the liquid phase. Data were satisfactorily fitted to the initial mass model. For the two soils, release of naproxen and carbamazepine was observed when the CaCl2 solution was used, but not in the soil/wastewater system. The compounds' release was higher in the topsoil than in the 30-40 cm soil. Sorption coefficients (K-d) for CaCl2 solution tests showed that in the topsoil, triclosan (64.9 L kg(-1)) is sorbed to a higher extent than carbamazepine and naproxen (5.81 and 2.39 L kg(-1), respectively). In the 30-40 cm soil, carbamazepine and naproxen K-d values (11.4 and 4.41 L kg(-1), respectively) were higher than those obtained for the topsoil, while the triclosan Ka value was significantly lower than in the topsoil (19.2 L kg(-1)). Differences in K-d values were found when comparing the results obtained for the two liquid phases. Sorption of naproxen and carbamazepine was reversible for both soils, while sorption of triclosan was found to be irreversible. This study shows the sorption behavior of three pharmaceuticals in a wastewater irrigated soil, as well as the importance of considering the initial mass of target pollutants in the estimation of their sorption parameters.

AB Surface waters worldwide are contaminated by pharmaceutical products that are released into the environment from wastewater treatment plants. Here, we hypothesize that pharmaceutical products have effects on organisms as well as genes related to nutrient cycling in complex microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, biofilms were grown in reactors and subjected low concentrations of three antibiotics [erythromycin, ER, sulfamethoxazole, SL and sulfamethazine, SN) and a lipid regulator (gemfibrozil, GM). Total community RNA was extracted and sequenced together with PCR amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Exposure to pharmaceutical products resulted in very little change in bacterial community composition at the phylum level based on 16S rRNA gene amplicons, even though some genera were significantly affected. In contrast, large shifts were observed in the active community composition based on taxonomic affiliations of mRNA sequences. Consequently, expression of gene categories related to N, P and C cycling were strongly affected by the presence of pharmaceutical products, with each treatment having specific effects. These results indicate that low pharmaceutical product concentrations rapidly provoke a variety of functional shifts in river bacterial communities. In the longer term these shifts in gene expression and microbial activity could lead to a disruption of important ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling.

AB Occurrence and removal efficiencies of fifteen pharmaceuticals were investigated in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant in Michigan. Concentrations of these pharmaceuticals were determined in both wastewater and sludge phases by a high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer. Detailed mass balance analysis was conducted during the whole treatment process to evaluate the contributing processes for pharmaceutical removal. Among the pharmaceuticals studied, demeclocycline, sulfamerazine, erythromycin and tylosin were not detected in the wastewater treatment plant influent. Other target pharmaceuticals detected in wastewater were also found in the corresponding sludge phase. The removal efficiencies of chlortetracycline, tetracycline, sulfamerazine, acetaminophen and caffeine were >99%, while doxycycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine and lincomycin exhibited relatively lower removal efficiencies (e.g., <50%). For sulfamethoxazole, the removal efficiency was approximately 90%. Carbamazepine manifested a net increase of mass, i.e. 41% more than the input from the influent. Based on the mass balance analysis, biotransformation is believed to be the predominant process responsible for the removal of pharmaceuticals (22% to 99%), whereas contribution of sorption to sludge was relatively insignificant (7%) for the investigated pharmaceuticals.

AB The stereoselectivity of R,S-venlafaxine and its metabolites R,S-O-desmethylvenlafaxine, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, O,N-didesmethylvenlafaxine, N,N-didesmethylvenlafaxine and tridesmethylvenlafaxine was studied in three processes: (i) anaerobic and aerobic laboratory scale tests; (ii) six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operating under different conditions: and (iii) a variety of wastewater treatments including conventional activated sludge, natural attenuation along a receiving river stream and storage in operational and seasonal reservoirs. In the laboratory and field studies, the degradation of the venlafaxine yielded O-desmethylvenalfaxine as the dominant metabolite under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Venlafaxine was almost exclusively converted to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under anaerobic conditions, but only a fraction of the drug was transformed to O-desmethylvenlafaxine under aerobic conditions. Degradation of venlafaxine involved only small stereoisomeric selectivity. In contrast, the degradation of O-desmethylvenlafaxine yielded remarkable S to R enrichment under aerobic conditions but none under anaerobic conditions. Determination of venlafaxine and its metabolites in the WWTPs agreed well with the stereoselectivity observed in the laboratory studies. Our results suggest that the levels of the drug and its metabolites and the stereoisomeric enrichment of the metabolite and its parent drug can be used for source tracking and for discrimination between domestic and nondomestic wastewater pollution. This was indeed demonstrated in the investigations carried out at the Jerusalem WWTP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The studied compounds belong to three different groups: PPCPs (caffeine, carbamazepine, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and trimethoprim), hormones (progesterone, estrone, and estradiol), and triazine herbicides and their metabolites (atrazine, deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, simazine, and cyanazine). In the system A. B, and C having low flow rate and high TOC, we observed the highest detection frequencies and mass flows of PPCPs compared to the other compounds, reflecting discharge of urban contaminations through WWTPs and CSOs. However, in River D, having high flow rate and low TOC, comparable frequency of detection of triazine and their by-products and PPCPs, reflecting cumulative loads of these compounds from the Great Lakes as well as persistency against natural attenuation processes. Considering large differences in the removal efficiencies of caffeine and carbamazepine, a high ratio of caffeine/carbamazepine might be an indicative of a greater proportion of raw sewage versus treated wastewater in surface waters. In addition, caffeine appeared to be a promising indicator of recent urban fecal contaminations, as shown by the significant correlation with FC (R-2 = 0.45), while carbamazepine is a good indicator of cumulative persistence compounds.

AB Background and purpose Estrogenic compounds and antibiotic residues in environment are receiving significant attention because of their potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. The objectives of this study were to determine the occurrence and seasonal variability of eight kinds of estrogenic compounds and 14 antibiotics. The study developed an occurrence database of the estrogenic compounds and antibiotics in spatial and temporal scale in Jiulongjiang River, South China, to provide useful information for environmental management of this region.
   Methods Eight estrogenic compounds and 14 antibiotic compounds were detected in Jiulongjiang River from 19 sampling sites during high-flow and low-flow season in surface water. The samples were preconcentrated by solid-phase extraction for analysis. Eight estrogenic compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Agilent 7890A-5975C), and antibiotics were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (ABI 3200 Q TRAP).
   Results All target compounds could be detected, except 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, sulfamerazine, and ofloxacin. The median concentrations for seven estrogenic compounds ranged from 6.00 to 610.72 ng/L, with the detection frequency range of 16.00-100%. However, the detection frequencies of 13 antibiotics detected varied from 50% to 100%, with the median concentrations ranged from 0.89 to 117.97 ng/L. Seasonal variations were obvious for most estrogenic compounds in Jiulongjiang River, except for octylphenol and estriol. There were significant (P < 0.001) differences for three tetracyclines, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethoxazole between in low-flow season and in high-flow season. Besides, spatially considerable variations in the concentrations were observed for antibiotics, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and bisphenol A.
   Conclusion The Jiulongjiang River water was more seriously contaminated by diethylstilbestrol, estrone, sulfamethazine, and tetracyclines. Higher overall concentration levels of estrogenic compounds and antibiotics were detected in low-flow water than those in high-flow water. The pollution of estrogenic compounds and antibiotics in Jiulongjiang River mainly came from municipal sewage and livestock breeding activities.

AB The presence of four phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs: nonylphenol [NP], NP monoethoxylate[NP1EO], bisphenol A [BPA], triclosan, [TCS]) and four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs: ibuprofen[IBF], ketoprofen [KFN], naproxen [NPX], diclofenac [DCF]) in a Greek river receiving treated municipal wastewater was investigated in this study.
   Samples were taken from four different points of the river and from the outlet of a sewage treatment plant (STP) during six sampling campaigns, and they were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   According to the results, EDCs were detected in almost all samples, whereas NSAIDs were detected mainly in wastewater and in the part of the river that receives wastewater from the STP. Among the target compounds, the highest mean concentrations in the river were detected for NP (1,345 ng L-1) and DCF (432 ng L-1). Calculation of daily loads of the target compounds showed that STP seems to be the major source of NSAIDs to the river, whereas other sources contribute significantly to the occurrence of EDCs. The environmental risk due to the presence of target compounds in river water was estimated, calculating risk quotients for different aquatic organisms (algae, daphnids, and fish). Results denoted the possible threat for the aquatic environment due to the presence of NP and TCS in the river.

AB This study aimed to investigate the removal mechanisms of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) and musks in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Biological removal and adsorption in the activated sludge tank as well as the effect of UV radiation used for disinfection purposes were considered when performing a mass balance on the WWTP throughout a 2-week sampling campaign.
   Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was carried out to analyse the PhACs in the influent and effluent samples. Ultrasonic solvent extraction was used before SPE for PhACs analysis in sludge samples. PhAC extracts were analysed by LC-MS. Solid-phase microextraction of liquid and sludge samples was used for the analysis of musks, which were detected by GC-MS. The fluxes of the most abundant compounds (13 PhACs and 5 musks) out of 79 compounds studied were used to perform the mass balance on the WWTP.
   Results show that incomplete removal of diclofenac, the compound that was found in the highest abundance, was observed via biodegradation and adsorption, and that UV photolysis was the main removal mechanism for this compound. The effect of adsorption to the secondary sludge was often negligible for the PhACs, with the exceptions of diclofenac, etofenamate, hydroxyzine and indapamide. However, the musks showed a high level of adsorption to the sludge. UV radiation had an important role in reducing the concentration of some of the target compounds (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen, clorazepate, indapamide, enalapril and atenolol) not removed in the activated sludge tank.
   The main removal mechanism of PhACs and musks studied in the WWTP was most often biological (45%), followed by adsorption (33%) and by UV radiation (22%). In the majority of the cases, the WWTP achieved > 75% removal of the most detected PhACs and musks, with the exception of diclofenac.

AB In an effort to assess the combined risk estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), and estriol (E3) pose to aquatic wildlife across United States watersheds, two sets of predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for significant reproductive effects in fish were compared to predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). One set of PNECs was developed for evaluation of effects following long-term exposures. A second set was derived for short-term exposures. Both sets of PNECs are expressed as a 17 beta-estradiol equivalent (E2-eq), with 2 and 5ng/L being considered the most likely levels above which fish reproduction may be harmed following long-term and short-term exposures, respectively. A geographic information system-based water quality model, Pharmaceutical Assessment and Transport Evaluation (PhATE (TM)), was used to compare these PNECs to mean and low flow concentrations of the steroid estrogens across 12U.S. watersheds. These watersheds represent approximately 19% of the surface area of the 48 North American states, contain 40 million people, and include over 44,000 kilometers of rivers. This analysis determined that only 0.8% of the segments (less than 1.1% of kilometers) of these watersheds would have a mean flow E2-eq concentration exceeding the long-term PNEC of 2.0ng/L; only 0.5% of the segments (less than 0.8% of kilometers) would have a critical low flow E2-eq exceeding the short-term PNEC of 5?ng/L. Those few river segments where the PNECs were exceeded were effluent dominated, being either headwater streams with a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), or flowing through a highly urbanized environment with one or several POTWs. These results suggest that aquatic species in most U.S. surface waters are not at risk from steroid estrogens that may be present as a result of human releases. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Nicotine, the main alkaloid of tobacco, is a non-prescription drug to which all members of a tobacco-smoking society are exposed either through direct smoke inhalation or through second-hand passive 'smoking'. Nicotine is also commercially available in some pharmaceutical products and is used worldwide as a botanical insecticide in agriculture. Nicotine dynamics in indoor and outdoor environments as well as the human excretions and the manufacturing process are responsible for its entry in the environment through municipal and industrial wastewater discharges. The presence of nicotine in surface and ground waters points out that it survives a conventional treatment process and persists in potable-water supplies. Complete removal of nicotine is instead reported when additional chlorination steps are used.
   In this paper a simulation of STP chlorination of nicotine and a genotoxic evaluation of its main degradation products are reported. Under laboratory conditions removal of nicotine seems not to be due to mineralization but to transformation in oxidized and chlorinated products. The by-products have been isolated after fractionation by diverse chromatographic procedures and their structures determined using mass spectrometry and H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. Preliminary genotoxic SOS Chromotests with Escherichia coli PQ37 evidence no toxicity of the products. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 21 pharmaceuticals (psychiatric drugs: alprazolam, amitriptyline, diazepam, fluoxetine, nordiazepam, carbamazepine, bromazepam; analgesics: aspirin, paracetamol; broncholidator: clenbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug: diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen; lipid regulator: gemfibrozil; stimulants: caffeine, theophylline) were identified in sites upstream and downstream of urban areas and discharge of wastewaters. Caffeine, carbamazepine, and diclofenac were relatively abundant into the surface water and could be considered as potential anthropogenic markers of wastewater discharges into rivers. A mass balance modeling has been applied to calculate approximate consumption rates for carbamazepine, diclofenac, and caffeine in both regions to assess socio-economic factors linked with pharmaceuticals behavior.

AB The European Union has defined environmental quality standards (EQSs) for surface waters for priority substances and several other pollutants. Furthermore national EQSs for several chemicals are valid in Austria. The study investigated the occurrence of these compounds in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In a first screening of 15 WWTPs relevant substances were identified, which subsequently were monitored in 9 WWTPs over 1 year (every 2 months). Out of 77 substances or groups of substances (including more than 90 substances) 13 were identified as potentially relevant in respect to water pollution and subjected to the monitoring, whereas most other compounds were detected in concentrations far below the respective EQS for surface waters and therefore not further considered. The preselected 13 compounds for monitoring were cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), diuron, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), di(ethyl-hydroxyl)phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin compounds (TBT), nonylphenoles (NP), adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and the complexing agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as well as nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). In the effluents of WWTPs the concentrations of the priority substances Cd, NP, TBT and diuron frequently exceeded the respective EQS, whereas the concentrations for DEHP and Ni were below the respective EQS. The effluent concentrations for AOX, EDTA, NTA, Cu, Se and Zn frequently are in the range or above the Austrian EQS for surface waters. Besides diuron and EDTA all compounds are removed at least partially during wastewater treatment and for most substances the removal via the excess sludge is the major removal pathway. For the 13 compounds which were monitored in WWTP effluents population equivalent specific discharges were calculated. Since for many compounds no or only few information is available, these population equivalent specific discharges can be used to assess emissions from municipal WWTPs to surface waters as well as to make a first assessment of the impact of a discharge on surface waters chemical status. Comparing discharges and river pollution on a load basis, the influence of diffuse sources becomes obvious and therefore should also be taken into consideration in river management.

AB In this paper the results of a thorough evaluation of the environmental fate and effects of azilsartan are presented. Azilsartan medoxomil is administered as a pro-drug for the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. The pro-drug is converted by hydrolysis to the active pharmaceutical ingredient azilsartan. Laboratory tests to evaluate the environmental fate and effects of azilsartan medoxomil were conducted with azilsartan and performed in accordance with OECD test guidelines. The predicted environmental concentration (PEG) in surface water was estimated at 0.32 mu g L-1 (above the action limit of 0.01 mu g L-1), triggering a Phase II assessment. Azilsartan is not readily biodegradable. Results of the water sediment study demonstrated significant shifting of azilsartan metabolites to sediment. Based on the equilibrium partitioning method, metabolites are unlikely to pose a risk to sediment-dwelling organisms. Ratios of the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) to the predicted-no-effect concentrations (PNECs) did not exceed the relevant triggers, and the risk to aquatic, sewage treatment plant (SIP), groundwater and sediment compartments was concluded acceptable. A terrestrial assessment was not triggered. Azilsartan poses an acceptable risk to the environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate and transport of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in ambient river waters is a major concern associated with effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This paper presents a methodology for quantifying the spatial distribution of EDCs in a river mixing zone. The core of the technical analysis is based on a two-dimensional steady-state analytical model characterized by ambient turbulence in the receiving water. This model was first calibrated with mass transport data from field measurements for a conservative substance (electrical conductivity) and then used to predict aqueous-phase EDC concentrations throughout a WWTP mixing zone. To demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology for water quality management purposes, the modeling framework presented in this paper was used to determine a lumped in-stream attenuation rate constant (k(d) = 3d(-1)) for 17 beta-estradiol under natural conditions. This rate constant likely accounts for the combined contributions of physical sorption, photolysis, microbial and chemical degradation, and the measured value is highly consistent with previously published results from bench-scale removal experiments.

AB Phenols pose a risk to the environment and to human health. Phenols found in rivers mainly originate from sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this paper, analytical procedures, based on deconvolution technology and retention time locking technology, were investigated to simultaneously identify and determine the concentrations of fifty different phenols in sewage water and effluents. Seventeen different phenols were found in sewage and five - including two regulated phenols (phenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol) and three un-regulated phenols (2-chlorophenol. 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol) - were identified in effluents of five STPs. A number of processes undertaken in five STPs were also investigated. These processes can be used to remove phenols at efficiency levels of between 88.95% and 99.97%. Among the processes tested, a combination of anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A(2)/O), continuous microfiltration (CMF), ozone oxidation (O-3), and chlorination, appeared to be the best option for the removal of key phenols. Among the five phenols identified in effluents, 2,5-dichlorophenol (1.89 mu g/L) and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol (22.6 mu g/L) pose the greatest ecological risk to receiving waters.

AB This study concentrates on the pretreatment of real wastewater using catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO). WO3- and PO43- contained in fosfomycin pharmaceutical wastewater (FPW) and Cu2+ contained in berberine pharmaceutical wastewater (BPW) were studied as CWAO influent. Mixture of this two streams were reused to form Cu2+ and [PxWmOy](q-). namely polyoxometalates (POMs) as co-catalyst system to treat themselves. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the initial oxygen pressure and temperature on the COD (chemical oxygen demand), TOC (total organic carbon) removal and biodegradable enhancement, it was discovered that over 40% of COD and TOC removal can be easily realized in an hour of WAO oxidation at 523 K, 1.4 MPa. The BOD5/COD (BOD5, biochemical oxygen demand in 5 days) of this two pharmaceutical mixture ascended from nonexistent to maximum 0.41 depends on the optimal FPW:BPW volume ratio 4:1, to compose POM co-catalyst system. Organic pollutants were incompletely oxidized to propionic acid and other intermediates. Some properties (e.g., TGA, IR, XRF) of POM catalyst separated from effluent, were obtained to provide additional information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antidepressant pharmaceuticals have recently been detected at low concentrations in wastewater and surface water. This work reports studies of the direct and indirect photochemical fate and treatment by advanced oxidation of three antidepressant compounds (duloxetine, venlafaxine and bupropion) in solutions of humic acid in order to elucidate their behavior in the natural environment prior to reaching a water treatment facility and potentially entering a potable water supply. Humic acid solution was prepared by adding to distilled water a known amount of organic matter as a photosensitizer. All three antidepressants react very rapidly with hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) rate constants of similar to 10(8) to 10(10) M-1 s(-1), but significantly slower with singlet oxygen ((1)Delta O-2) (similar to 10(3) to 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The steady-state concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and (1)Delta O-2, in a sample of humic acid solution were measured and used with the second order rate constants to show that the hydroxyl radical was an order of magnitude more effective than the singlet oxygen in the solar-induced photochemical degradation of the antidepressants. Excited state dissolved organic matter also accounted for a substantial portion of degradation of duloxetine, decreasing its half-life by 27% under solar irradiation. Several reaction pathways and by-products arising from the photodegradation were identified using gamma-irradiation followed by LC-MS analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of three compounds spiked in secondary treated wastewater by means of simulated solar radiation over titania suspensions was investigated. Bisphenol-A (BPA) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) were chosen as representatives of emerging micro-contaminants, while phenol was chosen as a reference contaminant. Ten titania samples were synthesized and employed to evaluate the effect of doping with nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, silver, sodium and potassium, as well as platinum dispersion on photocatalytic activity. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption and selective chemisorption of CO or hydrogen.
   A 0.5% Pt/TiO2 catalyst (38 m(2)/g surface area, 72:28 anatase:rutile, 20 and 2 nm crystallite size for TiO2 and Pt, respectively) was highly active for the degradation of the contaminants, whose reactivity increased in the order: phenol < BPA <= EE2: a commercially available Aeroxide P25 TiO2 exhibited comparable activity.
   The effect of various operating conditions, such as 0.5% Pt/TiO2 concentration (125-1000 mg/L), initial contaminant concentration (100-300 mu g/L each), photon flux (17.4 x 10(-8)-58 x 10(-8) einstein/(Ls) provided by a 150 W Xenon lamp) and the water matrix (wastewater and ultrapure water), on degradation was then assessed. Reaction rates increased linearly with catalyst concentration and photon flux, confirming the photo-induced nature of the activation of the catalytic process: likewise, a linear dependence of rate on initial concentration occurred denoting first order kinetics. Degradation in wastewater was slower than in pure water by an order of magnitude, implying the scavenging behavior of effluent's constituents against hydroxyl radicals.
   The implications for tertiary wastewater treatment (e.g. mineralization, disinfection and removal of estrogenicity) are also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigates possible uptake and bioconcentration of different classes of pharmaceuticals residues (organic contaminants) in fish bile using a simplified analytical methodology based on solid phase microextration (SPME). The use of solid phase microextraction (SPME), as a simple analytical tool, to screen for target pharmaceuticals in fish bile samples was validated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) following short-term laboratory exposures to carbamazepine and fluoxetine. While fish bioconcentrated both fluoxetine and carbamazepine from exposure water, fluoxetine accumulated to a greater degree in bile than carbamazepine. Good agreement was obtained for both analytes in bile samples between SPME and traditional liquid (solvent) extraction approaches (R-2 > 0.99). The field application of SPME sampling was further demonstrated in fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), a small-bodied fish caged upstream and downstream of a local wastewater treatment plant where fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and sertraline were detected in fish bile at the downstream location. SPME is a promising analytical tool for investigating the bioconcentration of trace contaminants in fish bile, facilitating detection of trace environmental contaminants otherwise undetectable due to low concentrations in the environment and biological tissues as well as the complexity of the sample matrices.

AB The cholesterol-lowering pharmaceutical gemfibrozil is a relevant environmental contaminant because of its frequency of detection in U.S. wastewaters at concentrations which have been shown to disrupt endocrine function in aquatic species. The treatment of gemfibrozil solutions with sodium hypochlorite yielded a 4'-chlorinated gemfibrozil analog (chlorogemfibrozil). In the presence of bromide ion, as is often encountered in municipal wastewater, hypobromous acid generated through a halogen exchange reaction produced an additional 4'-brominated gemfibrozil product (bromogemfibrozil). Standards of chloro- and bromogemfibrozil were synthesized, isolated and characterized using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to follow the in situ halogenation reaction of gemfibrozil in deionized water and wastewater matrices, and to measure levels of gemfibrozil (254 +/- 20 ng/L), chlorogemfibrozil (166 +/- 121 ng/L), and bromogemfibrozil (50 +/- 11 ng/L) in advanced primary wastewater treatment effluent treated by chlorination. Chlorogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of 11-ketotestosterone at 55.1 mu g/L and bromogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of testosterone at 58.8 mu g/L in vivo in Japanese medaka in a 21 day exposure. These results indicated that aqueous exposure to halogenated degradates of gemfibrozil enhanced the antiandrogenicity of the parent compound in a model fish species, demonstrating that chlorination may increase the toxicity of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water.

AB Data were collected at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Burlington, Vermont, USA, (serving 30,000 people) to assess the relative contribution of CSO (combined sewer overflow) bypass flows and treated wastewater effluent to the load of steroid hormones and other wastewater micropollutants (WMPs) from a WWTP to a lake. Flow-weighted composite samples were collected over a 13 month period at this WWTP from CSO bypass flows or plant influent flows (n = 28) and treated effluent discharges (n = 22). Although CSO discharges represent 10% of the total annual water discharge (CSO plus treated plant effluent discharges) from the WWTP, CSO discharges contribute 40-90% of the annual load for hormones and WMPs with high (>90%) wastewater treatment removal efficiency. By contrast, compounds with low removal efficiencies (<90%) have less than 10% of annual load contributed by CSO discharges. Concentrations of estrogens, androgens, and WMPs generally are 10 times higher in CSO discharges compared to treated wastewater discharges. Compound concentrations in samples of CSO discharges generally decrease with increasing flow because of wastewater dilution by rainfall runoff By contrast, concentrations of hormones and many WMPs in samples from treated discharges can increase with increasing flow due to decreasing removal efficiency.

TI Life Cycle Comparison of Environmental Emissions from Three Disposal
   Options for Unused Pharmaceuticals
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

AB We use life cycle assessment methodology to compare three disposal options for unused pharmaceuticals: (i) incineration after take-back to a pharmacy, (ii) wastewater treatment after toilet disposal, and (iii) landfilling or incineration after trash disposal. For each option, emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment (API emissions) are estimated along with nine other types of emissions to air and water (non-API emissions). Under a scenario with 50% take-back to a pharmacy and 50% trash disposal, current API emissions are expected to be reduced by 93%. This is within 6% of a 100% trash disposal scenario, which achieves an 88% reduction. The 50% take-back scenario achieves a modest reduction in API emissions over a 100% trash scenario while increasing most non-API emissions by over 300%. If the 50% of unused pharmaceuticals not taken-back are toileted instead of trashed, all emissions increase relative to 100% trash disposal. Evidence suggests that 50% participation in take-back programs could be an upper bound. As a result, we recommend trash disposal for unused pharmaceuticals. A 100% trash disposal program would have similar API emissions to a take-back program with 50% participation, while also having significantly lower non-API emissions, lower financial costs, higher convenience, and higher compliance rates.

AB The effect of inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the TiO2 photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants was investigated. The presence of HPO42-, NH4+, and HCO3- resulted in a significantly negative impact on the photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from synthetic water due to their strong adsorption on the surface of TiO2. However, only a weak impact was noted during photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluent with these ions added, since the presence of DOM in real wastewater played a more important role in inhibiting photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity than inorganic ions. By investigating the effect of different DOM fractions on photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity, polar compounds (PC) were found to cause a temporary increase in estrogenic activity during TiO2 photocatalysis. Fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular weight (MW) analysis on secondary effluent spiked with PC during TiO2 photocatalysis suggest that large MW organic matter (>4.5 kDa) in secondary effluent, such as humic/fulvic acid, not only could play an important role in inhibiting photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity but also is responsible for the temporary increase in estrogenic activity during the same process.

AB By using the metal reducing capacities of bacteria, Pd nanoparticles can be produced in a sustainable way ('bio-Pd'). These bio-Pd nanoparticles can be used as a catalyst in, for example, dehalogenation reactions. However, some halogenated compounds are not efficiently degraded using a bio-Pd catalyst. This study shows that the activity of bio-Pd can be improved by doping with Au(0) ('bio-Pd/Au'). In contrast with bio-Pd, bio-Pd/Au could perform the removal of the model pharmaceutical compound diclofenac from an aqueous medium in batch experiments at neutral pH and with H-2 as the hydrogen donor (first order decay constant of 0.078 +/- 0.009 h(-1)). Dehalogenation was for both catalysts the only observed reaction. For bio-Pd/Au, a disproportional increase of catalytic activity was observed with increasing Pd-content of the catalyst. In contrast, when varying the Au-content of the catalyst, a Pd/Au mass ratio of 50/1 showed the highest catalytic activity (first order decay value of 0.52 +/- 0.02 h(-1)). The removal of 6.40 mu g L-1 diclofenac from a wastewater treatment plant effluent using bio-Pd was not possible even after prolonged reaction time. However, by using the most active bio-Pd/Au catalyst, 43.8 +/- 0.5% of the initially present diclofenac could be removed after 24 h. This study shows that doping of bio-Pd nanoparticles with Au(0) can be a promising approach for the reductive treatment of wastewaters containing halogenated contaminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Removal of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofioxacin (LEVO) was studied in two oxidation processes: photocatalysis (UVC lamp (254 nm), TiO2) and ozonation. LEVO (C-o = 20 mg/L) was no longer detected after an ozone dose of 20.5 mg/L and after 180 min of photocatalytic oxidation. COD removals of 59% and 70% were measured for 270 mg/L of transferred ozone dose and 300 min of photocatalytic oxidation, respectively. Extensive treatment with ozone did not result in further reduction in COD levels reaching a plateau at the above mentioned value, however increased irradiation time led to increased COD removal during photocatalytic treatment. Both treatment methods proved to be effective ways of removing antibacterial activity. From agar diffusion test with Escherichia coli, it was observed that a transferred ozone dose of at least 20.5 mg/L and 180 min of irradiation were enough to completely remove antibacterial activity. Both treatments methods were shown to efficiently remove LEVO and its antibacterial activity and show promising results as possible applications for removal of antibiotics in wastewater.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation (O-3/UVA/TiO2) of diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and emerging water pollutant, was studied through the influence of some operational variables (gas flow rate, initial concentrations of ozone, DCF and TiO2), ozone consumption and ecotoxicity. Further, the stability and activity of the catalyst was investigated. Both ozone gas and initial diclofenac concentrations highly affected DCF and total organic carbon (TOC:) removals while the gas flow rate exerted a negligible influence under the experimental conditions here applied. Complete elimination of DCF was achieved within 6 min and from 60 to 75% of TOC removals were observed after 60 min of reaction regardless of the water matrix used, ultrapure water or urban waste wastewater. Optimum concentration of TiO2 was found between 0.5 and 2.5 g L-1 and ozone consumption around 6 mg per mg TOC consumed was obtained after 30 min of reaction. Daphnia magna exposition to untreated DCF aqueous solution led to 65% of death of these organisms, though after treatment, ecotoxicity levels of 20% were achieved. Photocatalytic ozonation showed the lowest ozone consumption and ecotoxicity compared to the other ozonation systems tested. Moreover, loss in the catalyst activity was not observed after 8 h of use as well as no leaching of Ti was detected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), represented by steroid hormones, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and bisphenol A have been determined in four sediment cores from the Gulf of Mexico, from New Orleans surface water (Lake Pontchartrain and Mississippi River), and from the influent and effluent of a New Orleans municipal sewage treatment plant. During the five-month monitoring of selected EDCs in the Mississippi River (MR) and Lake Pontchartrain (LP) in 2008, 21 of 29 OCPs in MR and 17 of 29 OCPs in LP were detected; bisphenol A was detected in all of the samples. Steroid hormones (estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) were detected occasionally. Total EDC (OCPs + PCBs + steroid hormones + bisphenol A) concentrations in the two surface water samples were found to vary from 148 to 1112 ng L-1. Strong correlation of the distribution of total OCPs, total PCBs and total EDCs between solid and water phases was found in LP, while moderate or no correlation existed in MR. OCPs, PCBs, steroid hormones, and bisphenol A were all detected in the ocean sediments, and total EDCs were measured in the range of 77 to 1796 ng g(-1) dry sediment weight. The EDCs were also found in untreated and treated municipal sewage samples with a removal efficiency of 83% for OCPs but no removal efficiency for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol.

AB In this work the effectiveness of membrane bioreactors as advanced treatment on the removal of emergent and priority organic compounds in wastewater treatment plants has been evaluated during a one-year monitoring study. The studied wastewater treatment plant operates with flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes in two parallel lines. Moreover, a reverse osmosis module connected in series after the hollow fibre membrane was evaluated for one month. Comparison of membrane bioreactor and conventional activated sludge treatment was also investigated, as well as the influence of the physicochemical properties of the compounds on the removal rates achieved. Sixteen pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups and eight priority organic pollutants, including linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, nonylphenol and its ethoxylates and phthalate, were monitored. The highest mean concentrations corresponded to priority organic pollutants (309 mu g L-1 of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate C-12) followed by pharmaceutical compounds (24.5 mu g L-1 of ibuprofen). No significant difference of effectiveness was found among flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes. However, an improvement was obtained with the addition of a reverse osmosis module for most of the compounds. Biodegradation has been shown as the main route involved in the removal of organic compounds during both technologies.

AB The Pithampur Industrial sectors I, II, and III, located approximately, 45 km from Indore in Central India have emerged as one of the largest industrial clusters in the region. Various types of industries ranging from automobiles to chemicals and pharmaceuticals have been set up in the region since 1990. Most of the industries have effluent treatment plants (ETP) for treating wastewater before its disposal on land and/or in water body. The present study is an attempt to assess the groundwater quality in the watersheds surrounding these industrial sectors to develop the baseline groundwater quality in order to enable the policy makers to facilitate decisions on the development of industries in this region. The industries are located in two sub-watersheds, namely, Gambhir river sub-watershed and Chambal river sub-watershed. Geologically, the study area is located in the Deccan traps of Cretaceous to Paleocene age. The different basaltic flow units underlie clayey soils varying in thickness from 2-3 m. The aquifer is mostly of unconfined nature. Samples have been collected from a network of observation wells set up in the watersheds. The water quality analysis of the groundwater samples has been carried out six times during three hydrological cycles of 2004, 2005, and 2006. The results indicate that a few observation wells in the vicinity of the industrial clusters have very high TDS concentration and exceed the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) guideline for TDS concentration. The contamination of groundwater has been more severe in the Gambhir watershed as compared to the Chambal watershed. The presence of the impermeable clay layers has resulted in a slow migration of contaminants from the sources. The findings reveal that there is no significant groundwater contamination in the Pithampur industrial sectors except in the vicinity of the industrial clusters, which indicates that there is good environmental space available for the expansion of industrial units in the Pithampur industrial hub.

AB Mediterranean rivers are characterized by a high flow variability, which is strongly influenced by the seasonal rainfall. When water scarcity periods occur, water flow, and dilution capacity of the river is reduced, increasing the potential environmental risk of pollutants. On the other hand, floods contribute to remobilization of pollutants from sediments. Contamination levels in Mediterranean rivers are frequently higher than in other European river basins, including pollution by pharmaceutical residues. Little attention has been paid to the transport behavior of emerging contaminants in surface waters once they are discharged from WWTP into a river. In this context, this work aimed to relate presence and fate of emerging contaminants with hydrological conditions of a typical Mediterranean River (Llobregat, NE Spain).
   River fresh water samples were collected twice a week over a period of 5 weeks at three sampling points. Sixty-six pharmaceutical compounds belonging to different therapeutical classes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
   Positive and negative correlations between the concentrations of the target analytes and hydrological variables like river flow and dissolved organic matter were observed pointing out the relevance of different hydrological phenomena like dilution effects or sediment re-suspension. Sensitivity calculations showed that the majority of compounds were sensitive to flow variations.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are commonly derived from industrial wastewater, which is often a consequence of an inadequate treatment of the latter. Improperly pretreated pharmaceutical wastewater could cause difficulties in operations of wastewater treatment plants while incomplete elimination of ECs during the processing might result in their appearance in drinking water.
   This paper deals with membrane treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater on a laboratory and a pilot scale as well as with the removal of the following veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, and febantel).
   The pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater by means of coagulation and microfiltration (MF) prevented the irreversible fouling of the fine porous structure of the reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes which were used in the final stage of wastewater processing. The percentage of the removal of the selected VPs ranges from 94% to almost 100% in the case of NF and RO membranes in both scales. The recovery percentage concerning the pilot scale amounted to 88%. Membrane cleaning was successfully carried out in both scales.
   The differences in retention between laboratory and pilot tests are due to different raw wastewater quality and different recovery and hydrodynamic of the two systems. Fouling and concentration polarization were more pronounced in laboratory setup (frame-plate module) than in pilot unit (spiral module). The proposed integrated membrane treatment (coagulation, MF, NF, and RO) can be employed for treatment of wastewater originating from pharmaceutical factory. The obtained permeate can be safely discharged to sewer system or could be reused in manufacturing process.

AB Progesterone (P4) and synthetic progestins (gestagens) from contraceptives and hormone therapy occur in treated wastewater and surface water, and they may have adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Little is known about the molecular and reproductive effects of P4 and synthetic progestins in fish, and effects of the antiprogestin mifepristone (RU486, an abortive) are unknown. We aimed at elucidating effects on the hormone system by quantitative determination of transcriptional changes of target genes induced by 2, 20, and 200 ng/L P4, RU486, norethindrone (NET), and levonorgestrel (LNG). We exposed zebrafish embryos for 144 h post fertilization (hpf) to these compounds and analyzed expressional changes of ar, esr1, vtg1, hsd17 beta 3, and progesterone (pgr), mineralo- (mr), and glucocorticoid (gr) receptors, each at 48, 96, and 144 hpf Concentrations of NET and LNG were constant during exposure, while P4 and RU486 decreased. P4 and RU486 were the most potent steroids. Significant up to 4-fold induction of pgr, ar, mr, and hsd17b3 occurred at 2 ng/L P4 and higher, while RU484 inhibited pgr expression. NET and LNG modulated some transcripts mainly above 2 ng/L. The expressional chances occurring at environmental levels may translate to negative interference with differentiation of brain and gonads, and consequently reproduction.

AB A properly configured bioreactor is in need to transfer the fungal biodegradation of recalcitrant pollutants into real applications. In this study, a novel plate bioreactor was designed to eliminate carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely concerned pharmaceutical, with the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on polyether foam under non-sterile conditions. The bioreactor was operated in both sequence batch and continuous modes. It was found that the sufficient supply with nutrients is crucial for an effective elimination of CBZ. Given the conditions, a high elimination of CBZ (60-80%) was achieved. The effective elimination was stable in a continuous operation for a long term (around 100 days). The high elimination of CBZ could also be achieved under real conditions with the effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diclofenac has been of environmental concern due to the potential harmful effects on non-target organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. In this study, we evaluated the transformation kinetics of diclofenac and its two major metabolites in two laboratory-scale experiments: the transformation of diclofenac in the presence of rat liver S9 fraction with co-factors, and the transformation of diclofenac, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac and diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide in the inoculum used for the OECD 301C ready-biodegradability test. 4'-Hydroxy-diclofenac was identified as the major phase I metabolite and diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide was identified as the major phase II metabolite in the S9 assay. Transformation of diclofenac in the microbial degradation test did not occur significantly for 28 d, whereas 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac degraded slowly, indicating that the biological removal of diclofenac is not likely to occur in conventional STPs unless sorptive removal is significant. However, diclofenac beta-O-acyl glucuronide deconjugated to form equimolar diclofenac within 7 d, in the microbial degradation test. The mixture of diclofenac and its two metabolites, formed after incubating diclofenac in S9 medium for 2 h, was spiked in the inoculum to link both assays. The concentrations of diclofenac and its metabolites, measured over time, agreed well with predicted values, using rate parameters obtained from independent experiments. The results show that phase II metabolites generated in mammals may deconjugate easily in conventional STPs to form a parent compound and that these processes should be considered during the environmental monitoring and risk assessment of diclofenac.

AB The antibiotic sulfonamide drug sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is extensively used in both human and veterinary medicine. Since it cannot be completely eliminated by the typical state-of-the-art wastewater treatment technology, it is frequently detected in the water cycle. SMX, as aromatic amine, can undergo abiotic transformations with the under denitrifying conditions produced nitrogen species nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite (NO2-). NO and aromatic amines are commonly known to form diazonium cations. Depending on the reaction conditions the diazonium cation disintegrates under cleavage of elementary nitrogen and substitutes its diazo-group by an NO(2)(-)group or by hydrogen. Following this approach, two transformation products (TPs) of the persistent SMX under denitrifying conditions were hypothesized and synthesized: 4-nitro-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (4-nitro-SMX) and N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-benzenesulfonamide (desamino-SMX). The synthesized compounds were identified by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and used as reference standards for their confirmation and quantification in denitrifying water/sediment batch experiments and in environmental samples. During the denitrifying degradation experiment SMX was no longer detected after 10 days whereas increasing concentrations of the two TPs were observed. However, at day 87 the SMX concentration recovered to 53 +/- 16% of the initial concentration after most of the nitrate was consumed. A retransformation of 4-nitro-SMX to SMX was postulated and confirmed by another anoxic water/sediment test in the absence of nitrate as electron acceptor. Both TPs were also detected in karst spring samples, highlighting the need and benefit of focusing on transformation products in environmental studies. Furthermore, the consideration of the retransformation potential of 4-nitro-SMX can substantially improve the understanding of SMX behavior during processes such as bank filtration and artificial recharge.

AB This work summarized all results obtained during almost two-years of a monitoring programme carried out in five municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) located in the north, centre and south-east of Spain. The study evaluated the occurrence and persistence of a group of 100 organic compounds belonging to several chemical groups (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and metabolites). The average removal efficiencies of the STPs studied varied from 20% (erythromycin) to 99% (acetaminophen). In analysed samples, we identified a large number of compounds at mean range concentrations between 7-59,495 ng/L and 5-32,720 ng/L for influent and effluent samples, respectively. This study also identified 20 of the mostly detected and persistent compounds in wastewater effluent, of which hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, gemfibrozil, galaxolide and three metabolites (fenofibric acid, 4-AAA and 4-FAA), presented the highest average contribution percentages, in relation to the total load of contaminants for the different STPs effluent studied.

AB Lists of compounds resulting from environmental monitoring may be conveniently represented in a very general way using Pareto distributions, after ranking them on descending order according to their concentration or hazard quotient expressed as percentages, depending on whether the objective of the monitoring is focussed on mass load occurrence or risk assessment respectively.
   Ranked distributions are characterized using appropriate indexes, such as h (Hirsch), well known in other disciplines like bibliometry. Furthermore, to such ordered distributions, simple numerical power type equations relating rank order and occurrence probability can be fitted, following the so-called power or Zipf law. Both h indices and the characteristic power law exponents are interpreted as measures of complexity of the overall mixture. On the other hand, compounds included within the h index may be seen as the most relevant in the mixture, thus providing a reasonable indication of what is worth analyzing. These concepts have been applied, as case study, to the characterization of the pharmaceutical compounds found in the input and output streams of wastewater treatment plants.
   Whereas both the concentration load and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs obviously decrease in the output of the treatment (influent > effluent, sludge), complexity quantified using the proposed indexes does not follow the same trend, being this behaviour common to the three plants examined.
   The joint combination of h compounds of the three plants studied allowed optimizing the list of compounds to be analyzed, which must be considered the key ones for the scenario under study.

AB The Llobregat River, which is characterized by important fluctuations of the flow rates, receives treated waters from WWTPs. During the years 2007 and 2008, the Llobregat River basin suffered from a severe drought which affected the supply of drinking water facilities (DWF) that rely on the exploitation of the river water. The Catalan Water Agency implemented a water reuse experiment with the objective of maintaining the river flow rate at sufficiently high level so as to ensure the supply of raw water to Barcelona's major DWF.
   A total of 103 emerging contaminants belonging to the groups of pharmaceuticals (74), illicit drugs (17) and oestrogens (12) were determined using LC-MS/MS methods in river water samples during the water reuse campaign. The effect of the reclaimed water discharge on the river water quality, in terms of contamination loads and environmental risk (based on the concentration addition mode), is discussed.
   Fifty-eight pharmaceuticals out of 74 monitored were detected at least in one sample. In river water upstream (site R0) majority of compounds were detected at low nanograms per litre levels, while downstream of discharge of tertiary effluent only few compounds were detected at levels higher than 100 ng L-1 (i.e. acetaminophen, diclofenac, erythromycin, sulfamethazine), but never exceeding 500 ng L-1. The total concentration of illicit drugs was found to be very low at both sampling sites (< 50 ng L-1). No relevant ecotoxicity risks were identified, except for pharmaceuticals vs. algae.
   In general, the discharge of reclaimed water in the river influenced perceptibly in terms of concentrations, mass loads and environmental risk, especially for pharmaceuticals and in less extent for illicit drugs. Nevertheless, it was not very significant in any case.

AB The two artificial sweeteners cyclamate (CYC) and acesulfame (ACE) have been detected in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants. As in both facilities ozonation might be applied, it is important to find out if undesired oxidation products (OPs) are formed.
   For the separation and detection of the OPs, several analytical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, were applied. In order to distinguish between direct ozone reaction and a radical mechanism, experiments were carried out at different pH values with and without scavenging OH radicals. Kinetic experiments were used for confirmation that the OPs are formed during short ozone contact time applied in waterworks. Samples from a waterworks using bank filtrate as raw water were analyzed in order to prove that the identified OPs are formed in real and full-scale ozone applications.
   In the case of CYC, oxidation mainly occurs at the carbon atom, where the sulfonamide moiety is bound to the cyclohexyl ring. Consequently, amidosulfonic acid and cyclohexanone are formed as main OPs of CYC. When ozone reacts at another carbon atom of the ring a keto moiety is introduced into the CYC molecule. Acetic acid and the product ACE OP170, an anionic compound with m/z=170 and an aldehyde hydrate moiety, were identified as the main OPs for ACE. The observed reaction products suggest an ozone reaction according to the Criegee mechanism due to the presence of a C=C double bond. ACE OP170 was also detected after the ozonation unit of a full-scale drinking water treatment plant which uses surface water-influenced bank filtrate as raw water.
   Acesulfame can be expected to be found in anthropogenic-influenced raw water used for drinking water production. However, when ACE OP170 is formed during ozonation, it is not expected to cause any problem for drinking water suppliers, because the primary findings suggest its removal in subsequent treatment steps, such as activated carbon filters.

AB The presence of the anesthetic lidocaine (LDC), the analgesic tramadol (TRA), the antidepressant venlafaxine (VEN) and the metabolites O-desmethyltramadol (ODT) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) was investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, in surface waters and in groundwater. The analytes were detected in all effluent samples and in only 64% of the surface water samples. The mean concentrations of the analytes in effluent samples from WWTPs with wastewater from only households and hospitals were 107 (LDC), 757 (TRA), 122 (ODT), 160 (VEN) and 637 ng L-1 (ODV), while the mean concentrations in effluents from WWTPs treating additionally wastewater from pharmaceutical industries as indirect dischargers were for some pharmaceuticals clearly higher. WWTP effluents were identified as important sources of the analyzed pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in surface waters. The concentrations of the compounds found in surface waters ranged from <LOQ to 176 (LDC), 381 (TRA), 261 (ODT), 122 (VEN) and 743 ng L-1 (ODV) and were dependent on the concentrations of the compounds in the WWTP effluents, the proportion of wastewater in the recipient water, the mean flow rate of the surface water, and the proximity of the sampling point to the WWTP discharge point. The dependence of the concentrations of the target compounds in the surface water on the distance between the sampling points and the points of WWTP discharge into the recipient rivers and streams indicates possible degradation of the compounds in the surface waters. Infiltration of the target analytes into groundwater was not observed.

AB This work presents an effective sample preparation method for the evaluation of seven pharmaceutical compounds belonging to different therapeutic classes in purified water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The target compounds include caffeine (stimulant), nicotine (stimulant), atenolol (beta blocker), metamizole (anti-inflammatory and analgesic), fluoxetine (antidepressant), paraxanthine (stimulant) and clofibric acid (lipid regulator). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were selected as extraction and detection techniques, respectively. A detailed study of the experimental conditions of extraction was performed. Under optimal conditions, recoveries obtained were in the range of 21% to 100%, and the relative standard deviations were below 12%. The detection and quantification limits of the method were in the range 2.2-97.4 and 21.1-324.7 ng L-1, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to evaluate the presence of these pharmaceutical compounds in wastewaters samples from wastewater treatment plants located on the Gran Canaria Island (Spain). Most of the compounds were detected at concentrations up to 12.31 mu g L-1 in the WWTP influents that were studied.

AB This is the first report on the occurrence of cocaine (COC) and benzoylecgonine (BE) residues in six samples collected from different wastewater treatment plants (WTP) located in the Brazilian Federal District (FD). Concentrations of BE in the influent sewage were used to calculate cocaine consumption (kg year(-1) per 1000 inhabitants) for each region attended by the WTP from two sampling campaigns (March and June, 2010). Among the WTP studied, samples from Samambaia showed higher concentrations (from 3866 to 2477 ng L-1 of BE and 805 to 579 ng L-1 of COC) and doses per inhabitants (more than 13 doses inhabitant(-1) per year). The extrapolation to the whole FD population points out to an annual consumption reaching 1.0 ton of free base cocaine, or 1.1 tons of cocaine hydrochloride. The work also addresses the influence of the cocaine presentation form (free base or hydrochloride) and the integration with chemical profiling results in a more realistic estimate, mainly concerning the viewpoints of forensics and law enforcement.

AB The occurrence of a range of recalcitrant organic micropollutants in our aquatic environment has led to the development of various tertiary wastewater treatment methods. In this study, biogenic manganese oxides (Bio-MnOx), biogenic silver nanoparticles (Bio-Ag0) and ionic silver were used for the oxidative removal of the frequently encountered drug diclofenac and its dechlorinated form, 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA). Diclofenac was rapidly degraded during ongoing manganese oxidation by Pseudomonas putida MnB6. Furthermore, whereas preoxidized Bio-MnOx, Bio-Ag0 and Ag+ separately did not show any removal capacity for diclofenac, an enhanced removal occurred when Bio-MnOx and silver species were combined. Similar results were obtained for APA. Finally, a slow removal of diclofenac but more rapid APA degradation was observed when silver was added to manganese-free P. putida biomass. Combining these results, three mechanisms of diclofenac and APA removal could be distinguished: (i) a co-metabolic removal during active Mn2+ oxidation by P. putida; (ii) a synergistic interaction between preoxidized Bio-MnOx and silver species; and (iii) a (bio)chemical process by biomass enriched with silver catalysts. This paper demonstrates the use of P. putida for water treatment purposes and is the first report of the application of silver combined with biogenic manganese for the removal of organic water contaminants.

AB Diclofenac is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and the receiving water bodies. In this study, biogenic Pd nanoparticles (bio-Pd) were successfully applied in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for the catalytic reduction of diclofenac. Hydrogen gas was produced in the cathodic compartment, and consumed as a hydrogen donor by the bio-Pd on the graphite electrodes. In this way, complete dechlorination of 1 mg diclofenac l-1 was achieved during batch recirculation experiments, whereas no significant removal was observed in the absence of the biocatalyst. The complete dechlorination of diclofenac was demonstrated by the concomitant production of 2-anilinophenylacetate (APA). Through the addition of -0.8 V to the circuit, continuous and complete removal of diclofenac was achieved in synthetic medium at a minimal HRT of 2 h. Continuous treatment of hospital WWTP effluent containing 1.28 mu g diclofenac l-1 resulted in a lower removal efficiency of 57%, which can probably be attributed to the affinity of other environmental constituents for the bio-Pd catalyst. Nevertheless, reductive catalysis coupled to sustainable hydrogen production in a MEC offers potential to lower the release of micropollutants from point-sources such as hospital WWTPs.

AB The mineralization of flumequine, an antimicrobial agent belonging to the first generation of synthetic fluoroquinolones which is detected in natural waters, has been studied by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) like electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) with UVA light. The experiments were performed in a cell containing a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air-diffusion cathode to generate H2O2 at constant current. The Fe2+ ion added to the medium increased the solubility of the drug by the formation of a complex of intense orange colour and also reacted with electrogenerated H2O2 to form hydroxyl radical from Fenton reaction. Oxidant hydroxyl radicals at the BDD surface were produced from water oxidation. A partial mineralization of flumequine in a solution near to saturation with optimum 2.0 mM Fe2+ at pH 3.0 was achieved by EF. The PEF process was more powerful, giving an almost total mineralization with 94-96% total organic carbon removal. Increasing current accelerated both treatments, but with decreasing mineralization current efficiency. Comparative treatments using a real wastewater matrix led to similar degradation degrees. The kinetics for flumequine decay always followed a pseudo-first-order reaction and its rate constant, similar for both EAOPs, raised with increasing current. Generated carboxylic acids like malonic, formic, oxalic and oxamic acids were quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC. Fe(III)-oxalate and Fe(III)-oxamate complexes were the most persistent by-products under EF conditions and their quicker photolysis by UVA light explains the higher oxidation power of PEF. The release of inorganic ions such as F-, NO3- and in lesser extent NH4+ was followed by ionic chromatography. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the removal efficiencies of 68 selected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) spiked in a wastewater matrix by ferrate (Fe(VI)) and further evaluated the degradation of these micropollutants present in secondary effluents of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by applying Fe(VI) treatment technology. Fe(VI)treatment resulted in selective oxidation of electron-rich organic moieties of these target compounds, such as phenol, olefin, amine and aniline moieties. But Fe(VI) failed to react with triclocarban, 3 androgens, 7 acidic pharmaceuticals, 2 neutral pharmaceuticals and erythromycin-H2O.Thirty-one target EDCs and PPCPs were detected in the effluents of the two WWTPs with concentrations ranging from 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng L-1 to 1156 +/- 182 ng L-1.Fe(VI) treatment resulted in further elimination of the detected EDCs and PPCPs during Fe(VI) treatment of the secondary wastewater effluents. The results from this study clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of Fe(VI) treatment as a tertiary treatment technology for a broad spectrum of micropollutants in wastewater. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent widely used in many household and personal care products. Widespread use of this compound has led to the elevated concentrations of triclosan in wastewater, wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters. In this study removal of triclosan by aqueous ozone was investigated and the degradation products formed during ozonation of an aqueous solution of triclosan were analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS. The following transformation products have been identified: 2,4-dichlorophenol, chlorocatecol, mono-hydroxy-triclosan and di-hydroxy-triclosan during treatment process. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of pure triclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol have been investigated and the results showed reduced genotoxic effects after ozonation, though the respective chlorophenol is harmful to aquatic organisms.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in bodies of water worldwide, yet their effects on the environment are not fully understood. Recent toxicity studies suggest that mixtures of PPCPs at low concentrations may be detrimental to exposed organisms, highlighting the need to remove PPCPs from wastewater treatment plant effluent before it is discharged to the environment. In this study, the utility of biofilm-based PPCP removal as a means to prevent environmental PPCP contamination was investigated. The removal of 14 PPCPs, each at an initial concentration of 10 mu g/L, was studied in laboratory sand columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. The examined PPCPs included biosol, biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, p-chloro-m-xylenol, chlorophene, sodium diclofenac, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, triclosan, and valproic acid. Ten of the PPCPs were removed by greater than 95% during column passage, while the four other compounds proved more recalcitrant. The effect of the concentration (either 50 or 1000 mu g/L) of an easily degradable primary substrate (acetate) supplied along with the mixture of PPCPs was examined. Most of the tested PPCPs were removed consistently by the biofilms regardless of the concentration of acetate, although the extent of removal for three compounds showed dependence on acetate concentration, and two behaved with no reproducible pattern over time. Biofilm protein measurements indicated that the mixture of PPCPs supplied to columns suppressed biofilm growth, suggesting toxicity of the PPCPs to the biofilm communities. This laboratory-scale experiment suggests that biofilm-based water treatment strategies, such as soil aquifer treatment and slow sand filtration, may be well-suited for the removal of many PPCPs from impacted water.

AB The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine is one of the most abundant pharmaceuticals in the German aquatic environment. The effect of low carbamazepine concentrations (1-50 mu g L-1) is discussed controversially, but ecotoxicological studies revealed reproduction toxicity, decreased enzymatic activity and bioaccumulation in different test organisms. Therefore, as a preventive step, an efficient and cost-effective technique for wastewater treatment plants is needed to stop the entry of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment. Cavitation, the formation, growth, and subsequent collapse of gas- or vapor-filled bubbles in fluids, was applied to solve this problem. The technique of Hydrodynamic-Acoustic-Cavitation was used showing high synergistic effect. Under optimized conditions carbamazepine (5 mu g L-1) was transformed by pseudo-first order kinetics to an extent of >96% within 15 min (27% by hydrodynamic cavitation, 33% by acoustic cavitation). A synergistic effect of 63% based on the sum of the single methods was calculated. Carbamazepine concentrations were monitored by a sensitive and selective immunoassay and after 60 min no known metabolites were detectable by LC-MS/MS. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study focuses on the removal of 32 selected micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors and biocides/pesticides) found in an effluent coming from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) based on activated sludge. Dissolved organic matter was present, with an initial total organic carbon of 15.9 mg L-1 and a real global quantity of micropollutants of 29.5 mu g L-1. The treatments tested on the micropollutants removal were: UV-light emitting at 254 nm (UV254) alone, dark Fenton (Fe-2+,Fe-3+/H2O2) and photo-Fenton (Fe-2+,Fe-3+/H2O2/light). Different irradiation sources were used for the photo-Fenton experiences: UV254 and simulated sunlight. Iron and H2O2 concentrations were also changed in photo-Fenton experiences in order to evaluate its influence on the degradation. All the experiments were developed at natural pH, near neutral. Photo-Fenton treatments employing UV254, 50 mg L-1 of H2O2, with and without adding iron (5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ added or 1.48 mg L-1 of total iron already present) gave the best results. Global percentages of micropollutants removal achieved were 98 and a 97% respectively, after 30 mm of treatments. As the H2O2 concentration increased (10, 25 and 50 mg L-1), best degradations were observed. UV254, Fenton, and photo-Fenton under simulated sunlight gave less promising results with lower percentages of removal.
   The highlight of this paper is to point out the possibility of the micropollutants degradation in spite the presence of DOM in much higher concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to examine sorption of a suite of 19 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) to activated sludge. Compounds examined in this study included neutral, nonionized TOrCs as well as acidic TOrCs which may carry a negative charge and basic TOrCs which may carry a positive charge at the pH of wastewater. These TOrCs were evaluated to examine how sorptive behavior might differ for TOrCs in different states of charge. Additionally, multiple sludges from geographically and operationally different wastewater treatment plants were studied to elicit how solid-phase characteristics influence TOrC sorption. Characterization of sludge solids from 6 full scale treatment facilities and 3 bench-scale reactors showed no significant difference in fraction organic carbon (f(oc)) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Sorption experiments demonstrated that sorption of TOrCs also exhibits little variation between these different sludges. Organic carbon normalized partition coefficients (log K-oc) were determined as a measure of sorption, and were found to correlate well with octanol water partition coefficients (log K-ow) for nonionized TOrCs, and log D-ow for anionic TOrCs where log D-ow is greater than 2. These data were used to construct a linear free energy relationship (LFER), which was comparable to existing LFERs for sorption onto sludge. No trend in sorption was apparent for the remaining anionic TOrCs or for the cationic TOrCs. These data suggest that predicting sorption to activated sludge based on K-ow values is a reasonable approach for neutral TOrCs using existing LFERs, but electrostatic (and likely other) interactions may govern the sorptive behavior of the charged organic chemicals to sludge.

AB The photochemical formation of hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) from effluent organic matter (EfOM) was evaluated using three bulk wastewater samples collected at different treatment facilities under simulated sunlight. For the samples studied, the formation rates of HO center dot (R-HO center dot) were obtained from the formation rate of phenol following the hydroxylation of benzene. The values of R-HO center dot ranged from 2.3 to 3.8 x 10(-10) M s(-1) for the samples studied. The formation rate of HO center dot from nitrate photolysis (R-NO3(HO center dot)) was determined to be 3.0 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot M-NO3(-1) s(-1). The HO center dot production rate from EfOM (R-EfOM(HO)) ranged from 0.76 to 1.3 x 10(-10) M s(-1). For the wastewater samples studied, R-EfOM(HO center dot) varied from 1.5 to 2.4 x 10(-7) M-HO center dot M-C(-1) s(-1) on molar carbon basis, which was dose to HO center dot production from nitrate photolysis. The apparent quantum yield for the formation of HO center dot from nitrate (Phi(a)(NO3-HO center dot)) was determined as 0.010 +/- 0.001 for the wavelength range 290-400 nm in ultrapure water. The apparent quantum yield for HO center dot formation in EfOM (Phi(a)(EfOM-HO center dot)) ranged from 6.1 to 9.8 x 10(-5), compared to 2.99 to 4.56 x 10-5 for organic matter (OM) isolates. The results indicate that wastewater effluents could produce significant concentrations of HO center dot, as shown by potential higher nitrate levels and relatively higher quantum yields of HO center dot fori-nation from EfOM.

AB A simple and cost effective analytical system combining flow injection (FI) continuous liquid-liquid extraction and sequential injection colorimetric detection was exploited. The standard or sample was injected into a reagent stream to form a less polar ion-association compound in the aqueous phase before merging with organic solvent to produce tiny segments of aqueous and organic phases alternately. The extraction occurred at the interface of the two phases while they were flowing through an extraction coil to be collected in a test tube. Phase separation occurred in the test tube, then the organic phase was aspirated by a sequential injection (SI) system to monitor the absorbance signal with a simple LED-LDR colorimeter. The extraction and detection processes could be operated independently. That means that while the detection of the signal was in operation, a new sample could be immediately injected for the new cycle of extraction to minimize the use of chemicals and time consumption. The system has been successfully demonstrated for the determination of anionic surfactant in wastewater samples and diphenhydramine hydrochloride in pharmaceutical samples.

AB Effluents from four healthcare facilities were characterized for the concentration of 16 common active pharmaceutical ingredients. The sampled facilities included a hospital, nursing care, assisted living, and independent living facility located within a single municipal wastewater system in Texas. Eleven of the 16 monitored pharmaceuticals were detected in at least 1 healthcare facility effluent and 2 measured antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were detected in all 4 facility effluents. Active pharmaceutical ingredient concentrations ranged from non-detectable levels for several corticosteroids in all facility effluents to 180 mu g/L sulfamethoxazole in the nursing care wastewater effluent. The mass of active pharmaceutical ingredients discharged to the municipality's wastewater conveyance system was determined by combining individual facility concentration data and daily wastewater flow. The estimated daily mass loading of all 16 pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.16 g/day to 23 g/day in the assisted living facility and nursing wastewater effluents, respectively. The combined active pharmaceutical ingredient mass loading for all four facilities was 42.6 g/day. These findings provide source characterization data for 16 common pharmaceuticals in healthcare facility wastewater and provide a basis for risk assessment of pharmaceuticals present in healthcare facility wastewaters.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are increasingly considered for de-centralized wastewater treatment. As MBR can be operated with higher sludge retention time and total suspended solids than conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) the elimination of micropollutants is slightly better for MBR than for WWTP. However to be able to use the MBR filtrate for artificial ground water recharge it is necessary to further improve elimination of micropollutants. In this study, the MBR process has therefore been combined with the adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC). PAC was dosed to the MBR filtrate of a pilot plant and removed again after a contact time of 30 min. PAC was recycled to the MBR process tank to use the residual adsorption capacity. The process was operated continuously for a period of 110 d. With 5-10 mg l(-1) PAC dosage a 50-80% improved elimination of carbamazepine and diclofenac could be achieved compared to the process without PAC.

AB The aquifer of the Tula Valley in Mexico is recharged by the infiltration of wastewater used for agricultural irrigation. This aquifer is considered to be a possible source of water for Mexico City, and although, in general, the water is good quality it still contains hardness and specific emerging pollutants. This research aims to identify a suitable treatment process based on membrane nanofiltration as it is a proven technology. Four nanofiltration membranes were compared using the critical flux concept in order to select the two that produced the largest amount of permeate. Membrane fouling was assessed by investigating the deposition of calcium using SEM images. To control hardness scaling, pretreatment with 150% of lime was employed. Finally, one membrane was selected based on its capability to remove carbamazepine, bisphenol A, triclosan, butilbenzylphthalate, and 4-nonylphenol. The selected membrane was operated at 800 kPa, producing 87.30 l m(-2) h(-1).

AB Capability of nanofiltration membranes (NF) to remove pharmaceutical active compounds from wastewater streams was investigated. Sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac sodium, hydrochlorothiazide, 4-acetamidoantipyrine, nicotine and ranitinide hydrochloride were selected as model compounds since they are widely produced as pharmaceutical agents. Two commercially available polyamide nanofiltration membranes (NF-90 and NF-270 from Dow FilmTec) were tested. Solute retention by NF-90 membrane was very high in all cases (over 95%), whereas NF-270 retention systematically appeared lower ranging from 75% (nicotine) to 95% (ranitidine hydrochloride). Temporal evolution of flux decline was also investigated. The influence of physicochemical properties of both membrane and solutes on membrane performance was analyzed to explore the main solute-membrane interactions that determine the solute transfer across the membrane. The influence of operation pressure on NF-90 and NF-270 rejection was also studied.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of medium-pressure I imps in the direct and indirect photodegradation of tetracyclines (TCs). We conducted a kinetic study of the process, determining the quantum yield for three tetracyclines (tetracycline, chlorotetracycline and oxytetracycline). We also analyzed the influence of different operational variables, such as: initial concentration; solution pH; presence of natural organic matter (NOM); the chemical composition of water, using ultrapure water (UW), surface water (SW), groundwater (GW), and wastewater (WW); the behavior of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, and the system toxicity during TCs photodegradation The results obtained shown that medium-pressure mercury lamp radiation is effective for the photooxidation of TCs in aqueous phase, mainly when these are at low concentrations. The rate constants obtained indicate that the photodegradation is pH-dependent and favored at pH 10 regardless of the tetracycline considered. The presence of H2O2 in the medium substantially increased the TC degradation rate and considerably reduced the time required to degrade 100% of the initial TC concentration. The TC photooxidation rate was higher in natural waters than in ultrapure water, attributable to the presence of dissolved organic matter, which can act as a photosensitizer, thereby favoring indirect TC degradation through the formation of radical species such as HO center dot. TOC values at the end of the treatment indicated that the percentage mineralization is a function of the initial TC concentration. The medium toxicity increased at the beginning of TC photooxidation, and treatment times of around 60 min are generally required for the toxicity to be lower than in the original solution.

AB For nearly two decades, the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) has been used as a valuable tool for determining the total estrogenic potency of various environmental samples, including influent and effluent streams at municipal wastewater plants. However, applying the YES assay to wastewater sludges and stabilized biosolids has been problematic. This is due to co-extracted compounds from the solids either proving toxic to the yeast or masking the presence of estrogenic substances. The present research describes the development and validation of sample preparation steps that mitigate the toxicity effects of municipal wastewater sludge and biosolid samples in the YES assay, while allowing for reliable dose-dependent expression of estrogenic activity. A copper work-up for sulfur removal and chromatographic cleanup with silica and alumina were required in addition to solid-phase extraction to adequately remove interfering compounds. Sample stabilization methods such as autoclaving, lyophilization and formaldehyde treatment were found to be detrimental to the assay. Hence, heat-drying is recommended to prevent cytotoxicity and the degradation of estrogenic substances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microscale sealed vessel pyrolysis (MSSVpy) was used to characterise the hydrophobic (HPO) and colloid (COL) fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the effluents (EFFs) of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and several primary source waters (SWs). The EFFs showed a large range of anthropogenically sourced organics - including the metabolites of industrial chemicals (e.g., dioxanes, n- and sec-alkyl substituted benzenes and long chain alkyl phenols), pharmaceuticals (e.g., N- and S-heterocycies) and human waste (e.g., S- and N-organics, steranes/sterenes) - as well as high concentrations of alkyl aromatic and N-organic products (e.g., alkyl indoles, carbazoles and beta-carbolines) attributed to the treatment biota. Some anthropogenic chemicals are potentially toxic at even trace levels, whilst the N-organics may be precursors for toxic N-disinfection by-products. Much lower concentrations of just a few of the anthropogenic and N-organic products were detected by more traditional flash pyrolysis (Flash-py) of the EFF samples, reflecting the higher sensitivity of MSSVpy to many chemical functionalities. Few of these products were detected in the corresponding MSSVpy analysis of the SWs, but these samples did show relatively high abundances of lignin (e.g., alkylphenols) and carbohydrate (e.g., furans) derived products. Their lower EFF abundances are consistent with efficient removal by the water treatment procedures applied. Conversely, the detection of the anthropogenics in the treated EFFs reflects their general resistance to treatment. Their occurrence in the HPO fractions isolated by XAD resin separation suggests a potential relationship with the structurally stable macromolecular fraction of the DOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present study deals with removal of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C2NP) as a model contaminant from pharmaceutical and pesticide industries using titanium dioxide nanoparticles as an adsorbent. 4C2NP is recalcitrant and persistent toward biodegradation and its generation in aqueous environment during formulation, distribution and field application of pesticides is often unavoidable. Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of contact time, nano-titanium dioxide dosage, initial pH, initial 4C2NP concentration and temperature on adsorption efficiency. The results showed that the adsorption capacity was increased with increasing 4C2NP concentration and temperature. Optimum conditions for 4C2NP adsorption were found to be initial pH a parts per thousand 2, nano-titanium dioxide dosage a parts per thousand 0.01 g/250 mL and equilibrium time a parts per thousand 1 h. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles recorded a maximum capacity of 86.3 mg/g at optimal conditions. The linear correlation coefficients of Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were obtained. The results revealed that the Freundlich isotherm fitted the experimental data better than the other isotherm models.

AB Determining the fate of emerging organic contaminants in an aquatic ecosystem is important for developing constructed wetlands (CWs) treatment technology. Experiments were carried out in subsurface flow CWs in Singapore to evaluate the fate and transport of eight pharmaceutical compounds. The CW system included three parallel horizontal subsurface flow CWs and three parallel unplanted beds fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The findings of the tests at 2-6 d HRTs showed that the pharmaceuticals could be categorized as (i) efficiently removed compounds with removal higher than 85% (ketoprofen and salicylic acid); (ii) moderately removed compounds with removal efficiencies between 50% and 85% (naproxen, ibuprofen and caffeine); and (iii) poorly removed compounds with efficiency rate lower than 50% (carbamazepine, diclofenac, and clofibric acid). Except for carbamazepine and salicylic acid, removal efficiencies of the selected pharmaceuticals showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement in planted beds as compared to the unplanted beds. Removal of caffeine, ketoprofen and clofibric acid were found to follow first order decay kinetics with decay constants higher in the planted beds than the unplanted beds. Correlations between pharmaceutical removal efficiencies and log K-ow were not significant (p > 0.05), implying that their removal is not well related to the compound's hydrophobicity.

AB zonation is an advanced water treatment process used to remove organic micropollutants (OMPs) such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). In this study, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, for ozonation and advanced oxidation process (AOP), were developed with percent-removal of OMPs by ozonation as the criterion variable. The models focused on PPCPs and pesticides elimination in bench-scale studies done within natural water matrices: Colorado River, Passaic River, Ohio River and Suwannee synthetic water. The OMPs removal for the different water matrices varied depending on the water quality conditions such as pH, DOC, alkalinity. The molecular descriptors used to define the OMPs physico-chemical properties range from one-dimensional (atom counts) to three-dimensional (quantum-chemical). Based on a statistical modeling approach using more than 40 molecular descriptors as predictors, descriptors influencing ozonation/AOP were chosen for inclusion in the QSAR models. The modeling approach was based on multiple linear regression (MLR). Also, a global model based on neural networks was created, compiling OMPs from all the four river water matrices. The chemically relevant molecular descriptors involved in the QSAR models were: energy difference between lowest unoccupied and highest occupied molecular orbital (E-LUMO-E-HOMO), electron-affinity (EA), number of halogen atoms (#X), number of ring atoms (#ring atoms), weakly polar component of the solvent accessible surface area (WPSA) and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C). All the QSAR models resulted in a goodness-of-fit, R-2, greater than 0.8. Internal and external validations were performed on the models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence and dissipation of 14 selected antibiotics comprising tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and chloramphenicols were investigated in two swine wastewater treatment systems in east China in three sampling surveys. The compounds were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The aqueous samples were unavoidably contaminated with antibiotics and the target antibiotics present in high contaminations were tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, and sulfadiazine, with maximum concentrations of the individual contaminants reaching 41.6 x 10(3), 23.8 x 10(3), 13.7 x 10(3), 685.6 x 10(3), and 98.8 x 10(3) ng/l, respectively. The concentration ranges of these compounds were in the same order of magnitude as previously reported values in China and elsewhere. Biological activity can significantly degrade the contaminants but showed low efficiencies of dissipation of other analytes at lower levels of contamination. The removal efficiencies varied for different compounds and depended on their physiochemical properties and the treatment processes utilized at each waste treatment plant. Some target antibiotics were present in feeds obtained from swine farms at a range of average concentrations between 0.1 and 46.8 mu g/kg. However, the extremely high levels of the main contaminants found in these wastewaters cannot be ascribed solely to the pattern of consumption of prescription feeds.

AB Increased attention is currently directed towards potential negative effects of pharmaceuticals and other micro-pollutants discharged into the aquatic environment via municipal sewage water. A number of additional treatment technologies, such as ozonation, have therefore been suggested as promising tools for improving the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). Constructed wetlands are also capable of removing a variety of micro-pollutants, including some pharmaceuticals, and could hence be a resource efficient complement to more advanced treatment technologies. The purpose of the present study was therefore to increase the knowledge base concerning the potential use of constructed wetlands as a treatment step to reduce emissions of organic micro-pollutants from municipal sewage effluents. Under cold winter conditions, incoming and outgoing waters from four Swedish free water surface wetlands, operated as final treatment steps of sewage effluent from municipal STPs, were sampled and analyzed for levels of a set of 92 pharmaceuticals and 22 inorganic components as well as assessed using subchronic ecotoxicity tests with a macro-alga and a crustacean.
   Sixty-five pharmaceuticals were detected in the range from 1 ng L-1 to 7.6 mu g L-1 in incoming and outgoing waters from the four investigated wetlands. Although the sampling design used in the present study lacks the robustness of volume proportional to 24 h composite samples, the average estimated removal rates ranged from 42% to 52%, which correlates to previous published values. The effects observed in the ecotoxicity tests with the macro-alga (EC(50)s in the range of 7.5-46%) and the crustacean (LOECs in the range of 11.25-90%) could not be assigned to either pharmaceutical residues or metals, but in general showed that these treatment facilities release water with a relatively low toxic potential, comparable to water that has been treated with advanced tertiary treatments.
   From the present study it can be concluded that constructed wetlands may provide a complementary sewage treatment option, especially where other treatment is lacking today. To fully remove micro-pollutants from sewage effluent, however, other more advanced treatment technologies are likely needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Antineoplastics in excreta from patients have been considered to be one of the origins of cytotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic contaminants in surface water. Recent studies have demonstrated that antineoplastics in clinical wastewater can be detoxified by electrolysis. In this study, to develop a method for the detoxification of antineoplastics in excreta, methotrexate solution in the presence of human urine was electrolyzed and evaluated. We found that urine inhibits detoxification by electrolysis; however, this inhibition decreased by diluting urine. In urine samples, the concentrations of active chlorine generated by anodic oxidation from 0.9% NaCl solution for inactivation of antineoplastics increased in dilution-dependent and time-dependent manner. These results indicate that electrolysis with platinum-based iridium oxide composite electrode is a possible method for the detoxification of a certain antineoplastic in urine. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Human pharmaceuticals are routinely being detected in the environment, and there is growing concern about whether these drugs could elicit effects on aquatic organisms. Regulatory paradigms have shifted accordingly, with a greater emphasis on chronic toxicity data compared with acute data. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 210 Early Life Stage Test has been proposed as a good measure of the potential for pharmaceuticals to elicit chronic toxicity. To begin building a data set regarding the early life-stage toxicity of pharmaceuticals to fish, fathead minnows (FHM) were exposed to amiodarone, carbamazepine, clozapine, dexamethasone, fenofibrate, ibuprofen, norethindrone, or verapamil. Survival and growth were used to assess chronic toxicity in FHM at 28 days posthatch. Exposure of FHM to carbamazepine, fenofibrate, and ibuprofen resulted in no significant adverse effects at the concentrations tested. FHM survival was not impacted by verapamil exposure; however, growth was significantly decreased at 600 mu g/L. Dexamethasone-exposed FHM showed a significant decrease in survival at a concentration of 577 mu g/L; however, growth was not impacted at the concentration tested. Norethindrone exposure resulted in a significant decrease in survival and dry weight at 14.8 and 0.74 mu g/L, respectively. Exposure to amiodarone and clozapine resulted in a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in growth at concentrations of 1020 and 30.8 mu g/L, respectively. Although the effect levels derived in this study are greater then concentrations observed in the environment, these data suggest that synthetic progestins may require additional research.

AB A survey on the presence of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater of a Spanish Mediterranean area (Castellon province) was carried out. The scope of the study included a wide variety of pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutical classes. For this purpose, 112 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, from different conventional wastewater treatment plants were collected. Two monitoring programmes were carried out along several seasons. The first was in June 2008 and January 2009, and the second in April and October 2009. During the first monitoring, the occurrence of 20 analytes in 84 urban wastewater samples (influent and effluent) was studied. The selection of these pharmaceuticals was mainly based on consumption. From these, 17 compounds were detected in the samples, with analgesics and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and lipid regulators being the most frequently detected groups. 4-Aminoantipyrine, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, naproxen and venlafaxine were the compounds most frequently found. In the highlight of these results, the number of analytes was increased up to around 50. A lot of antibiotic compounds were added to the target list as they were considered "priority pharmaceuticals" due to their more potential hazardous effects in the aquatic environment. Data obtained during the second monitoring programme (spring and autumn) corroborated the results from the first one (summer and winter). Analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators together with quinolone and macrolide antibiotics were the most abundant pharmaceuticals. Similar median concentrations were found over the year and seasonal variation was not clearly observed. The removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater treatment plants was roughly evaluated. Our results indicated that elimination of most of the selected compounds occurred during the treatment process of influent wastewater, although it was incomplete. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are consumed in large amounts as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs worldwide. Based on what has been learnt from studies of other human pharmaceuticals, they are likely to be present in the aquatic environment. However, to date, information on the environmental concentrations of GCs is very limited. The situation is complicated by the fact that a considerable number of GCs are in everyday use in most developed countries. Hence, obtaining a full picture of GC concentrations in the aquatic environment using the traditional analytical chemistry approach would be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we took a modelling approach to predict the total environmental concentration of all synthetic GCs (consisting of 28 individual GCs) in the River Thames, as a first step in risk assessment of these drugs. Using reliable data on consumption, the LF2000-WQX model predicts mean concentrations up to 30 ng/L of total GCs in surface water as a best case scenario when the lowest excretion and highest removal rates in sewage treatment works were used, whereas mean concentrations up to 850 ng/L were predicted when the highest excretion and lowest removal rates are considered. We also present the 10th and 90th percentile concentrations (which indicate the likely range of concentrations seen from high flow to low flow conditions in the river) of the highest and lowest consumed GCs, to show the spatial and temporal variations of the concentrations of individual GCs, These data probably provide reliable estimates of the likely range of concentrations of GCs in a typical river impacted by effluent from many sewage treatment plants. Results also identify the hot spots where field studies on fish could be focused. To determine if aquatic organisms face any threat from GCs, laboratory toxicity studies should be conducted using concentrations similar to those reported here. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, and the concerns for negative effects on aquatic organisms, has gained increasing attention over the last years. As ecotoxicity data are lacking for most active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), it is important to identify strategies to prioritise APIs for ecotoxicity testing and environmental monitoring. We have used nine previously proposed prioritisation schemes, both risk- and hazard-based, to rank 582 APIs. The similarities and differences in overall ranking results and input data were compared. Moreover, we analysed how well the methods ranked seven relatively well-studied APIs. It is concluded that the hazard-based methods were more successful in correctly ranking the well-studied APIs, but the fish plasma model, which includes human pharmacological data, also showed a high success rate. The results of the analyses show that the input data availability vary significantly: some data, such as logP, are available for most API while information about environmental concentrations and bioconcentration are still scarce. The results also suggest that the exposure estimates in risk-based methods need to be improved and that the inclusion of effect measures at first-tier prioritisation might underestimate risks. It is proposed that in order to develop an adequate prioritisation scheme, improved data on exposure such as degradation and sewage treatment removal and bioconcentration ability should be further considered. The use of ATC codes may also be useful for the development of a prioritisation scheme that includes the mode of action of pharmaceuticals and, to some extent, mixture effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reclaimed water irrigation can satisfy increasing water demand, but it may also introduce pharmaceutical contaminants into the soil and groundwater environment. In this work, a range of laboratory experiments were conducted to test whether biochar can be amended in soils to enhance removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from reclaimed water. Eight types of biochar were tested in laboratory sorption experiments yielding solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d) of 2-104 L/kg. Two types of biochar with relatively high Kd were used in column leaching experiments to assess their effect on reclaimed water SMX transport through soils. Only about 2-14% of the SMX was transported through biochar-amended soils, while 60% was found in the leachate of the unamended soils. Toxicity characteristic leaching experiments confirmed that the mobility and bioavailability of SMX in biochar-amended soils were lower than that of unamended soils. However, biochar with high accumulations of SMX was still found to inhibit the growth of the bacteria compared to biochar with less SMX which showed no effects. Thus, biochar with very high pharmaceutical sorption abilities may find use as a low-cost alternative sorbent for treating wastewater plant effluent, but should be used with caution as an amendment to soils irrigated with reclaimed water or waste water.

AB Black light photocatalytic ozonation of two pharmaceutical compounds, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF), and the resulting total organic carbon (TOC) are studied. DCF and SMX removals from some mg.L-1 to 100 mu g.L-1 are achieved in approximately 7 and 15 min ozonation, respectively, regardless of the ozone process, while the resulting TOC is eliminated via hydroxyl radical reactions. For initial concentrations lower than 50 mu g.L-1, competition between direct ozonation and hydroxyl radical oxidation to eliminate SMX and DCF takes place. The initial reaction period for cases of high and low concentration is simulated through fast-moderate and slow gas-liquid second order reaction kinetics, respectively. For high starting concentrations the calculated results suggest the presence of ozone fast reacting intermediates. For low starting concentration, calculated results indicate the importance of hydroxyl radical oxidation and the synergic effect of ozone and photocatalytic oxidation. Kinetic data of TOC ozonation, photocatalytic oxidation, and photocatalytic ozonation are also presented.

AB Ciprofloxacin was identified among the top 10 of high priority pharmaceuticals detected in aquatic environment. Potassium ferrate(VI) is a strong oxidant which possesses very high redox potential and has been widely studied in water disinfection and removing organic and inorganic pollutants. There has been one published work to detail the removal of phosphorus as well as micro-pollutants including ciprofloxacin by ferrate in wastewater treatment. However, developing a simple ciprofloxacin detection method and study of feasibility of its treatment by ferrate was the objective of this work. Solid phase extraction (SPE) and UV/vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm was employed to analyse CIP. A series of jar test experiments was carried out to evaluate the ferrate performance for CIP reduction. Results demonstrated that a SPE coupled with simple UV/vis spectrophotometric method can detect CIP with detection limit of 10 mu g/L for model wastewater samples. Ferrate can remove at least 60% of CIP from model wastewater even at very low ferrate doses (<0.3 mg/L). Besides, with increasing in ferrate dose up to 1 mg/L as Fe, the removal efficiency of CIP was higher than 80%. However, increasing ferrate dose further did not show significant increasing in CIP removal. Initial pH of CIP model wastewater samples has no obvious influence on CIP removal, while final solution pH (adjusted and after dosing ferrate) affected the performance of ferrate treatment significantly. CIP removal efficiency by ferrate decreased significantly if final pH of the waste water solution was greater than CIP's pK(a) (i.e. pH > 8). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photolytic and photocatalytic removals of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated under UVC radiation. Wastewater collected from WYETH, St-Laurent, Canada contained high concentrations of EE2 and LNG in suspension and coloring agent tartrazine in solution. Aqueous phase removals of EE2 and LNG were studied as individual contaminants in water and in complex matrices including: co-contaminants in water, in simulated synthetic wastewater and in the wastewater. After 30 min of UVC photocatalysis of the individual contaminants, removal efficiencies of EE2 and LNG were 92% and 97%, respectively, while higher photolytic removal was observed for LNG (94%) compared to EE2 (60%). Hydroxyl radicals were shown to contribute significantly to the removal of both compounds in water. In contrast to EE2, photolytic removal of LNG was higher than its photocatalytic removal efficiencies in all complex matrices. Higher photolytic removal of LNG was attributed to the fact that it absorbs UVC radiation considerably more than EE2. Lower photocatalytic removals of LNG in complex matrices compared to its photocatalytic removal as an individual contaminant was due to the presence of EE2 at concentrations up to five times larger than LNG in water, thus leading to increased competition for hydroxyl radicals and retarding LNG removal. In the wastewater matrix photocatalytic removals for EE2 and LNG were similar at 48%, whereas the photolytic removal of LNG (76%) was higher than EE2 (29%). The applicability of UVC processes for reduction of hormone content in similar wastewaters was demonstrated. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biologically treated wastewater spiked with a mixture of 56 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) was treated with 0-20 mg/L chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution in laboratory-scale experiments. Wastewater effluents were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in Sweden, one with extended nitrogen removal (low COD) and one without (high COD). About one third of the tested APIs resisted degradation even at the highest ClO2 dose (20 mg/L), while others were reduced by more than 90% at the lowest ClO2 level (0.5 mg/L). In the low COD effluent, more than half of the APIs were oxidized at 5 mg/L ClO2, while in high COD effluent a significant increase in API oxidation was observed after treatment with 8 mg/L ClO2. This study illustrates the successful degradation of several APIs during treatment of wastewater effluents with chlorine dioxide. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The documented presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water sources has prompted a global interest in understanding their environmental fate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can potentially alter the fate of these contaminants in aqueous systems by forming contaminant-DOM complexes. In-situ measurements were made to assess the interactions between three common PPCP contaminants and two distinct DOM sources: a wastewater treatment plant (WWOM) and the Suwannee River, GA (SROM). Aqueous DOM solutions (8.0 mg L-1 C, pH 7.4) were spiked with a range of concentrations of bisphenol-A, carbamazepine and ibuprofen to assess the DOM fluorophores quenched by PPCP interaction in excitation-emission matrices (EEM). Interaction effects on target analyte (PPCP) concentrations were also quantified using direct aqueous injection ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). At low bisphenol-A concentration, WVVOM fluorescence was quenched in an EEM region attributed to microbial by product-like and humic acid-like DOM components, whereas carbamazepine and ibuprofen quenched fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Fluorescence quenching of SROM by bisphenol-A and carbamazepine was centered on humic acid-like components, whereas ibuprofen quenched the fulvic acid-like fluorophores. Nearly complete LC-MS/MS recovery of all three contaminants was obtained, irrespective of analyte structure and DOM source, indicating relatively weak PPCP-DOM bonding interactions. The results suggest that presence of DOM at environmentally-relevant concentration can give rise to PPCP interactions that could potentially affect their environmental transport, but these DOM-contaminant interactions do not suppress the accurate assessment of target analyte concentrations by aqueous injection LC-MS/MSMS.

AB This study aims to assess the occurrence, fate and temporal and spatial distribution of anthropogenic contaminants in a river subjected to different pressures (industrial, agricultural, wastewater discharges). For this purpose, the Henares River basin (central Spain) can be considered a representative basin within a continental Mediterranean climate. As the studied river runs through several residential, industrial and agricultural areas, it would be expected that the chemical water quality is modified along its course. Thereby the selection of sampling points and timing of sample collection are critical factors in the monitoring of a river basin. In this study, six different monitoring campaigns were performed in 2010 and contaminants were measured at the effluent point of the main wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the river basin and at five different points upstream and downstream from the WWTP emission point. The target compounds evaluated were personal care products (PCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides. Results show that the river is clearly influenced by wastewater discharges and also by its proximity to agricultural areas. The contaminants detected at higher concentrations were the PCPs. The spatial distribution of the contaminants indicates that the studied contaminants persist along the river. In the time period studied no great seasonal variations of PCPs at the river collection points were observed. In contrast, a temporal trend of pesticides and PAHs was observed. Besides the target compounds, other new contaminants were identified and evaluated in the water samples, some of them being investigated for the first time in the aquatic environment. The behaviour of three important transformation products was also evaluated: 9,10-anthracenodione, galaxolide-lactone and 4-amino-musk xylene. These were found at higher concentrations than their parent compounds, indicating the significance of including the study of transformation products in the monitoring programmes.

AB Data are presented on the concentrations of alkylphenol and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) and persistent organic compounds in largemouth bass collected from a waste-water dominated stream in downtown Chicago. The fish residue concentrations of APES are compared to concentrations of the APEs in the water that were collected at weekly intervals over two months bracketing the fall (2006) and a spring (2007) fish collection. The concentrations of APEs were significantly higher in the spring-collected fish (5.42 mu g/g) versus the fall (0.99 mu g/g) tand these differences were shared by differences in the water concentrations (spring - 11.47 versus fall - 3.44 mu g/L). The differences in water concentration were negatively correlated with water temperatures observed over the two sampling times. Fish residue concentrations of persistent organic compounds (PCBs, PBDEs, toxaphene, and many legacy pesticides including the DDT family) did not vary from fall to spring. Some of these residue concentrations were comparable to the highest NPE (nonylphenol ethoxylate) homologue concentrations, e.g. NP1EO was 3.5 mu g/g in the bass for the spring, the PBDE-congener 47 and p,p'-DDE averaged 1.0 mu g/g and 0.5 mu g/g, respectively, over both seasons. All the other persistent single-analyte concentrations were lower. Biological endpoints for endocrine effects measured in the same fish showed that there was an apparent positive correlation for physiological effects based on increased vitellogenin levels in males versus concentration of NPEs; however there were no observable histological differences in fall versus spring fish samples.

AB This pilot-scale research project investigated and compared the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and other micropollutants from treated wastewater by ozone/biofiltration and reverse osmosis (RO). The reduction in UV254 absorbance as a function of ozone dose correlated well with the reduction in nonbiodegradable dissolved organic carbon and simultaneous production of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). BDOC analyses demonstrated that ozone does not mineralize organics in treated wastewater and that biofiltration can remove the organic oxidation products of ozonation. Biofiltration is recommended for treatment of ozone contactor effluent to minimize the presence of unknown micropollutant oxidation products in the treated water. Ozone/biofiltration and RO were compared on the basis of micropollutant removal efficiency, energy consumption, and waste production. Ozone doses of 4-8 mg/L were nearly as effective as RO for removing micropollutants. When wider environmental impacts such as energy consumption, water recovery, and waste production are considered, ozone/biofiltration may be a more desirable process than RO for removing PPCPs and other trace organics from treated wastewater.

AB Removal of seven active pharmaceutical substances (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, clofibric acid, mefenamic acid, and gemfibrozil) was assessed by batch experiments, with suspended biofilm carriers and activated sludge from several full-scale wastewater treatment plants. A distinct difference between nitrifying activated sludge and suspended biofilm carrier removal of several pharmaceuticals was demonstrated. Biofilm carriers from full-scale nitrifying wastewater treatment plants, demonstrated considerably higher removal rates per unit biomass (i.e. suspended solids for the sludges and attached solids for the carriers) of diclofenac, ketoprofen, gemfibrozil, clofibric acid and mefenamic acid compared to the sludges. Among the target pharmaceuticals, only ibuprofen and naproxen showed similar removal rates per unit biomass for the sludges and biofilm carriers. In contrast to the pharmaceutical removal, the nitrification capacity per unit biomass was lower for the carriers than the sludges, which suggests that neither the nitrite nor the ammonia oxidizing bacteria are primarily responsible for the observed differences in pharmaceutical removal. The low ability of ammonia oxidizing bacteria to degrade or transform the target pharmaceuticals was further demonstrated by the limited pharmaceutical removal in an experiment with continuous nitritation and biofilm carriers from a partial nitritation/anammox sludge liquor treatment process.

AB The sorption and biodegradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), in an activated sludge system were investigated. Experiments were carried out by contacting 100 mu g/L of each sulfonamide compound individually with 2.56 g/L of MLSS at 25 +/- 0.5 degrees C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen of 3.0 +/- 0.1 mg/L in a batch reactor over different periods of 2 d and 14 d. All sulfonamides were removed completely over 11-13 d. Sorptive equilibrium was established well within the first few hours, followed by a lag period of 1-3 days before biodegradation was to deplete the antibiotic compounds linearly in the ensuing 10 days. Apparent zeroth-order rate constants were obtained by regression analysis of measured aqueous concentration vs. time profiles to a kinetic model accounting for sorption and biodegradation; they were 8.1, 7.9, and 7.7 mu g/L/d for SDM, SMX, and SMM, respectively, at activated sludge concentration of 2.56 g/L. The measured kinetics implied that with typical hydraulic retention time (e.g. 6 h) provided by WWTP the removal of sulfonamide compounds from the wastewater during the activated sludge process would approximate 2 mu g/L.

AB The goal of this paper was to develop a modified photo-Fenton treatment able to degrade micro pollutants in municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents at a neutral pH with minimal iron and H2O2 concentrations. Complexation of Fe by ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) leads to stabilization and solubilization of Fe at natural pH. Photo-Fenton experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant. Samples were treated with solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by HPLC-Qsrap-MS. The rapid degradation of contaminants within the first minutes of illumination and the low detrimental impact on degradation of bicarbonates present in the water suggested that radical species other than HO center dot are responsible for the efficiency of such photo-Fenton process. Disinfection of MWTP effluents by the same process showed promising results, although disinfection was not complete.

AB With the recent emergence of estrogenic contaminants as reclaimed wastewater quality issue, our study has investigated the removal of bisphenol-A (BPA) using a submerged membrane bioreactor. Experiments were performed at initial BPA concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 15 mg/L. A very low sludge mineralization occurred in the bioreactor (with a VSS/TSS ratio around 0.8-0.9), irrespective of the variation of biomass concentration and a long retention time of solids. The specific oxygen uptake rate values recorded did not reveal any significant change in the microbial respiratory activity in the absence (2.00 mg O-2/g VSS h) and in the presence (1.4 mg O-2/g VSS h) of BPA in the synthetic effluent. The performance of the bioreactor in terms of COD removal remained constant and reached 99% irrespective of the hydraulic retention time imposed (3-6 h), whereas 66-99% of COD removal was recorded while using conventional activated sludge system. The limit of the toxicity (21.6 g BPA/m(3)/d) determined for the bioreactor membrane system was higher than that recorded for the conventional activated sludge (2.5 g BPA/m(3)/d). BPA was effectively removed in the membrane bioreactor (abatement >= 98% was reached) due to adsorption and biodegradation/transformation processes. Residual BPA concentrations recorded in the mixed liquor remained low (0.017-0.004 mg/L), when the raw wastewater contained a concentration of 1.0 mg BPA/L. This indicates that BPA was not accumulated in the membrane bioreactor, but bacteria oxidized it. Likewise, the membrane bioreactor was found to be effective in removing ammonia-nitrogen (>99% of N-NH4 removed), whereas 61% of phosphate (P-PO4) could be simultaneously removed. The membrane bioreactor was a total barrier for total suspended solid and turbidity was effectively removed (residual turbidity was lower than 1.0 NTU). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Some of the pharmaceuticals that are not extensively investigated in the aquatic environment are the anesthetic lidocaine (LDC), the analgesic tramadol (TRA), and the antidepressant venlafaxine (VEN). LDC metabolizes to 2,6-xylidine (2,6-DMA) and monoethylglycinexylidine (MEGX), TRA to O-desmethyltramadol (ODT), and VEN to O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV). Within this study, the distribution and behavior of these compounds in German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated.
   Methods Samples of influents and effluents from WWTPs in Hesse, Germany were collected between January and September 2010. Analytes were extracted from wastewater samples by solid-phase extraction and from solid samples by sonication. Extracts were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   Results LDC, TRA, VEN, ODT, and ODV were detected in all analyzed influent and effluent samples. 2,6-DMA could not be identified. MEGX was not detected. TRA and ODV were present in untreated wastewater at the highest concentrations (max, 1,129 (TRA) and 3,302 ng L-1 (ODV)), while the concentrations of LDC and VEN were all significantly lower (mean, 135 (LDC) and 116 ng L-1 (VEN)). All of the analytes were only partially removed in the WWTPs. The mean ratios between the concentrations of the metabolites and their respective parent compounds in influents were 4.7 (ODV/VEN) and 0.7 (ODT/TRA). These values remain approximately constant comparing influents and effluents.
   Conclusions LDC, TRA, VEN, ODT, and ODV are only partially removed from sewage water by WWTPs and thus are continuously discharged in respective recipient rivers. A further transformation of TRA and VEN into the known metabolites during treatment in the WWTPs is not observed.

AB Purpose The present research aims to optimize the removal of ibuprofen (IBP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic drug from the aqueous solution using a synthesized magnetic carbon-iron nanocomposite, and to investigate the individual and combined effects of the independent process variables.
   Method Combining the adsorptive capability of carbon and magnetic property of iron, a carbon-iron nanocomposite was synthesized. A four-factor Box-Behnken experimental design-based optimization modeling was performed for maximizing the removal of IBP from water by the nanocomposite using the batch experimental data. A quadratic model was built to predict the responses. Significance of the process variables and their interactions was tested by the analysis of variance and t test statistics.
   Results The experimental maximum removals of IBP from the aqueous solution by carbon and magnetic nanocomposite were 14.74% and 60.39%, respectively. The model predicted maximum removal of 65.81% under the optimum conditions of the independent variables (IBP concentration 80 mg/l; temperature 48 degrees C; pH 2.50; dose 0.6 g/l) was very close to the experimental value (65.12 +/- 0.92%). pH of the solution exhibited most significant effect on IBP adsorption.
   Conclusion The developed magnetic nanocomposite was found superior than its precursor carbon exhibiting higher removal of IBP from the water and can be easily separated from the aqueous phase under temporary external magnetic field. The developed magnetic nanocomposite may be used for an efficient removal of IBP from the water.

AB Photolytic reactions are often complex, involving various competing or parallel pathways and leading to multiple reaction products. Removal of anthelmintic drugs (AD) - levamisole (LEV), albendazole (ABZ), praziquantel (PZQ), febantel (FEBA) from water and their photodegradation products with reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes were investigated in this work. Simulation of photodegradation of ADs was carried out under laboratory conditions with UV lamp at a wavelength of 254 nm for 4 h.
   Reverse osmosis (LFC-1 and XLE) and tight nanofiltration (NF90) membranes showed good removal (> 83%) of anthelmintic drugs in binary solutions and in mixture. Other nanofiltration (NF270, NF and DK) membranes had rejection between 22 and 45% for smaller drugs (LEV and ALB) and > 90% for PZQ and FEBA. These results show that main rejection mechanism in binary solutions was size exclusion and in mixture additional physico-chemical interactions had influence.
   After the UV treatment anthelmintic drugs were degraded into several photodegradation products (5 for LEV, 2 for ABZ, 1 for PZQ and 8 for FEBA). Reverse osmosis and NF90 membranes removed > 95% of all photodegradation products (except FEBA, around 70%) and other nanofiltration membranes between 33 and 99.99%.

AB Trimethoprim (TMP) is a widely prescribed antibiotic frequently detected in the aquatic environment. This study investigates the reactions of TMP and two sub structure model compounds [2, 4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine (DAMP) and 3, 4, 5-trimethoxytoluene (TMT)] with chlorine dioxide (ClO2), one of the common water disinfection oxidants, in batch reactors. A second-order kinetic model that incorporates the organic compounds' acid-base speciation can sufficiently describe the reaction kinetics and is used to evaluate molecules' reactive sites. TMP's apparent second-order rate constant (k(app)) with ClO2 ranges at 5-33 M-1 . s(-1) from pH 2.7 to 9.1, corresponding to a half-life of 40.8 min at pH 7 and 1 mg/L of ClO2. The reaction's pH dependence is linked to protonation of the ring nitrogens on TMP's 2, 4-diaminopyrimidinyl moiety. Comparison among TMP, DAMP, and TMT reveals that the reactivity of TMP to ClO2 resides mostly in its diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at neutral to alkaline pH, but centers in its trimethoxybenzyl moiety at acidic conditions. LC/MS analysis shows that oxidation of TMP by ClO2 generates Cl and OH substitutions at both diaminopyrimidinyl and trimethoxybenzyl moieties and other products. The reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to model the decay of TMP by ClO2 in surface water samples, but overestimate the decay in wastewater samples. Overall, transformation of TMP by ClO2 can be expected under typical ClO2 disinfection conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000420. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB This paper reports a sensitive analytical method based on microwave-assisted extraction and continuous solidphase extraction (SPE), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS), for the simultaneous determination of residues of 18 pharmaceuticals (analgesics, antibacterials, anti-epileptics, beta-blockers, lipid regulators and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), one personal care product and 3 hormones in soils, sediments and sludge. The analytes are extracted with 3:2 methanol/water under the action of microwave energy and the resulting extract is passed through a SPE column to clean up the sample matrix and preconcentrate the analytes. Then, the analytes, trapped on Oasis-HLB sorbent, are eluted with ethyl acetate, silylated and determined by GC-MS. The proposed method provides a linear response over the concentration range 2.5-20000 ng/kg with correlation coefficients higher than 0.994 in all cases. Also, it features low limits of detection (0.8-5.1 ng/kg), good precision (within- and between-day relative standard deviation less than 7%) and recoveries ranging from 91 to 101%. The method was successfully applied to agricultural soils, river and pond sediments, and sewage sludge. All samples contained some target analyte and sludge contained most -some at considerably high concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Applying sewage sludge to soil is a common practice in many parts of the world. Thus, pharmaceutical compounds, such as azoles, can be released into the environment after sludge is applied to soil. To understand the fate of clotrimazole and fluconazole (pharmaceuticals used as antifungals in humans) in soil after its amendment with sludge, a reliable and sensitive method has been developed to determine these compounds in the solid and aqueous phases of soil. Desorption of clotrimazole from soil amended with sludge was negligible, whereas a rapid desorption of fluconazole was observed. Dissipation rates of these azoles were determined in amended soil incubated at 25 degrees C with moisture contents ranging from 4.5 to 20%. Clotrimazole was more persistent than fluconazole in dry soil, whereas the contrary occurred in wet soil. Partitioning soil:soil solution of these azoles varied with time and moisture contents. Clotrimazole was found in soil with negligible amounts in soil solution, whereas fluconazole was approximately partitioned 50:50 during the assay time (60d) at any soil moisture content. Occasional rainfall coupled with a relatively low binding soil capacity can result in the contamination of surface and groundwaters by fluconazole, whereas clotrimazole will remain in the soil.

AB The authors examined effects of three common contaminants, caffeine (CF), acetaminophen (AC), and diclofenac (DF), as well as their mixtures on the development, functioning, and biodiversity of river biofilm communities. Biofilms were cultivated in rotating annular reactors. Treatments included AC, CF, DF, AC+CF, AC+DF, CF+DF, AC+CF+DF at 5 mu g/L, and their molar equivalent as carbon and nutrients. Incubations using 14C-labeled AC, DF, and CF indicated that 90% of the CF, 80% of the AC, and less than 2% of the DF were converted to CO2. Digital imaging revealed a variety of effects on algal, cyanobacterial, and bacterial biomass. Algal biomass was unaffected by AC or CF in combination with DF but significantly reduced by all other treatments. Cyanobacterial biomass was influenced only by the AC+DF application. All treatments other than AC resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial biomass. Diclofenac or DF+CF and DF+AC resulted in increases in micrometazoan grazing. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of Eubacterial community DNA, evaluated by principal component analysis and analysis of similarity, indicated that relative to the control, all treatments had effects on microbial community structure (r=0.47, p<0.001). However, the AC+CF+DF treatment was not significantly different from its molar equivalent carbon and nutrient additions. The Archaeal community differed significantly in its response to these exposures based on community analyses, confirming a need to integrate these organisms into ecotoxicological studies. Environ.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have emerged as a group of potential environmental contaminants of concern. The occurrence of gemfibrozil, a lipid-regulating drug, was studied in the influent and effluent at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and groundwater below a land application site receiving treated effluent from the WWTP. In addition, the sorption of gemfibrozil in two loam soils and sand was assessed, and biological degradation rates in two soil types under aerobic conditions were also determined. Results showed that concentrations of gemfibrozil in wastewater influent, effluent, and groundwater were in the range of 3.47 to 63.8 mu g/L, 0.08 to 19.4 mu g/L, and undetectable to 6.86 mu g/L, respectively. Data also indicated that gemfibrozil in the wastewater could reach groundwater following land application of the treated effluent. Soilwater distribution coefficients for gemfibrozil, determined by the batch equilibrium method, varied with organic carbon content in the soils. The sorption capacity was silt loam>sandy loam>sand. Under aerobic conditions, dissipation half-lives for gemfibrozil in sandy loam and silt loam soils were 17.8 and 20.6 days, respectively; 25.4 and 11.3% of gemfibrozil was lost through biodegradation from the two soils over 14 days.

AB An increasing number of pharmaceutical active substances are produced through biotechnological processes. For sustained and safe growth of the host organisms as well as optimal expression, purification, and formulation of the product, biotechnological manufacturing processes need optimal and robust environmental conditions, which are attained through the use of buffers, chelators, and antibiotics, beside nutrients. These ancillary substances are drained with the wastewater to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and are released after treatment with the effluent to receiving waters. The potential risks of such substances to WWTPs and surface waters were investigated. Three common buffers (morpholinoethane sulfonic acid [MES], morpholinopropanesulfonic acid [MOPS], 1,4-piperazine (diethanesulfonic acid) [PIPES]), one chelator (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]), and one antibiotic (gentamycin) were searched in the literature for environmental data or tested for biodegradability and inhibition of activated sludge as well as acute toxicity to algae, daphnids, and fish. Amounts of the ancillary substances used in the European biotechnological production plants of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd in Basle (Switzerland) and Penzberg (Germany), and actual wastewater fluxes through the respective WWTP, as well as realistic dilution factors for the local receiving water, were documented. Based on this information, site-specific predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the WWTPs and surface waters in Basle and Penzberg were extrapolated. These PECs were compared with predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) for the WWTP and surface waters, derived from sludge inhibition and ecotoxicity results, respectively. For all five ancillary substances investigated, all PEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios are <1, indicating no significant risk to the WWTPs or the receiving waters at both sites. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The acute and chronic toxicological effects of Carbamazepine (CBZ) on Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa were explored for the first time in this study. The results showed that CBZ could significantly inhibit the growth of the two algae in almost all treatment groups. EC50 values indicated that, CBZ had a relatively limited acute toxic effect (0-144h) on S. obliquus and C. pyrenoidosa, while, chronic tests (5-30 d) displayed higher toxicity. Chlorophyll a syntheses were nearly all inhibited by CBZ exposure. However, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in acute tests of both algae were markedly promoted. According to the results, Chlorophyll a content and CAT activity of S. obliquus were more sensitive to CBZ than that of C. pyrenoidosa. While for SOD, quite to the contrary, C. pyrenoidosa was more vulnerable. We obtained a similar result in chronic tests. This research furthers our understanding of CBZ toxicity to aquatic organisms.

AB The paper presents an analysis of measured riverine concentrations of 16 common organic water contaminants. From observed concentrations we back-calculate emissions and chemical half lives through a simple inverse model. The analysis does not allow identifying a single half life/emission factor combination, but a set of combinations which are Pareto-optimal (or "non-dominated"). The approach is shown to provide a rational basis for the screening of chemicals in rivers: with reference to the 16 chemicals considered here, estimated emission factors and half lives are consistent with the ones reported in other studies. For more precise estimates, prior knowledge about either emission factors or half lives is necessary. For the considered chemicals, loads to European seas can be subsequently estimated with an uncertainty usually within a factor of 2. The approach can be proposed for the inventorying of catchment-specific chemical pollutant emissions required for European environmental policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inhibition of mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is well characterized; major hepatic CYPs can be inhibited by drugs and other environmental contaminants. CYP function and inhibition has not yet been well established in fish yet these studies are important for several reasons. First, such studies will provide functional information for non-mammalian CYPs. Second, specific inhibitors can be used as a diagnostic tool for studying CYP-mediated reactions. Lastly, pharmaceutical mixtures are found in the aquatic environment and adverse effects associated with drug-drug interactions, including CYP inhibition by ;pharmaceuticals may be of concern. Using liver microsomes from untreated and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF)-treated rainbow trout, eight fluorescent CYP-mecliated catalytic assays were used to assess in vitro CYP inhibition by four pharmaceuticals: fluoxetine, ciprofloxacin, gemfibrozil and erythromycin. Expressed zebrafish CYP1 proteins (CYP1A, CYP1B1,CYP1C1 and CYP1C2) were assessed for inhibition with selected substrates. All pharmaceuticals decreased the metabolism of a number of substrates. Fluoxetine was the strongest and most broad inhibitor of CYP-mediated reactions in liver microsomes. Zebrafish CYP1s were strongly inhibited by erythromycin and fluoxetine. Although the pharmaceuticals are selective CYP inhibitors in mammals, inhibition across a number of substrates suggests they are broad inhibitors in fish. These data demonstrate that in vitro hepatic CYP inhibition by pharmaceuticals is possible in fish and the patterns seen here are different than what would be expected based on CYP inhibition in mammals.

AB A monitoring programme was carried out on wastewater, surface and drinking water on the NW area of Spain during the four seasons of a year period (November 2007-September 2008). This study covered a series of emerging pollutants of different classes, including pharmaceuticals, neutral and acidic organophosphorus flame retardant/plasticizers (OPs), triclosan, phenoxy-herbicides, insect repellents and UV filters. From the total set of 53 compounds, 19 were found in raw wastewater with median concentrations higher than 0.1 mu g L-1. Among them, salicylic acid, ibuprofen and the UV filter benzophenone-4 (BP-4) were the most concentrated, exceeding the 1 mu g L-1 median value. Subsequently, 11 of these contaminants are not efficiently enough removed in the small WWTPs tested and their median concentrations in effluents still surpassed the 0.1 mu g L-1, so that they can spread through surface water. These chemicals are the pharmaceuticals naproxen, diclofenac and atenolol; the OPs tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tri(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) and diethylhexyl phosphate (DEHP); and the sulphonate UV filters BP-4 and 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulphonic acid (PBSA). These OPs were then the dominant emerging pollutants occurring in surface and drinking water, where they are detected in the 20-200 ng L-1 range. Pharmaceuticals and UV filters are typically below the 10 ng L-1 level. Finally, herbicides were only detected in the last sampling campaign under the 100 ng L-1 drinking water European Union limit.

AB Concentration levels of six natural and anthropogenic origin steroid estrogens, namely, diethylstilbestrol (DES), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethinylestradiol (EE2), and estradiol-17-valerate (Ev), from different effluents in Beijing were assessed. Sampling sites include two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), a chemical plant, a hospital, a pharmaceutical factory, a hennery, and a fish pool. In general, concentrations of estrogens in the effluents varied from no detection (nd) to 11.1 ng/l, 0.7 to 1.2 x 10(3) ng/l, nd to 67.4 ng/l, nd to 4.1 x 10(3) ng/l, nd to 1.2 x 10(3) ng/l, and nd to 11.2 ng/l for DES, E1, E2, EE2, E3, and Ev, respectively. The concentration levels of steroid estrogens from different effluents decreased in the order of pharmaceutical factory and WWTP inlets > hospital > hennery > chemical factory > fish pool. This study indicated that natural estrogens E1, E2, and E3 and synthetic estrogen EE2 are the dominant steroid estrogens found in the different Beijing effluents. For source identification, an indicator (hE = E3/(E1 + E2 + E3)) was used to trace human estrogen excretion. Accordingly, hE in effluents from the hospital and WWTP inlets exceeded 0.4, while much smaller values were obtained for the other effluents. Human excretions were the major contributor of natural estrogens in municipal wastewater. Estimation results demonstrated that direct discharge was the major contributor of steroid estrogen pollution in receiving waters.

AB Streptomycin is a common contaminant in a variety of industrial and agricultural wastewaters. The available information on the potential toxicity of streptomycin of fresh algae implicated in the treatment of biological wastewater is extremely limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of streptomycin on physiological indices and photosynthesis-related gene transcription. The results of short-term batch bioassays indicated that streptomycin was more sensitive to cyanobacteria than to green algae. The EC50 of streptomycin in Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris were 0.28 and 20.08 mg L-1, respectively. These selected streptomycin concentrations inhibited algal cell growth and decreased chlorophyll or phycocyanobilin content. Streptomycin also destroyed the overall membrane system, which was speculated from malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage increasing after streptomycin exposure. Two algae were induced to increase their antioxidant enzyme activities to withstand streptomycin. However, the balance between oxidant substance and antioxidant enzyme was broken, because reactive oxygen species (ROS) content simultaneously increased. Streptomycin inhibited photosynthesis-related gene transcription in C. vulgaris and M. aeruginosa. Transcript levels of psaB, psbA, and rbcL in C. vulgaris decreased to only 14.5%, 32.2%, and 9.3% of the control, respectively. Similarly, the transcript levels of psaB, psbD, and rbcL in M. aeruginosa decreased markedly in the present of streptomycin. The transcription of these genes was 12.4%, 26.1%, and 28.4% of the control after 0.1 mg L-1 streptomycin exposure, respectively. Our results demonstrate that streptomycin is toxic to fresh algae, affects photosynthesis-related gene transcription, and blocks electron transport and ROS overproduction.

AB Synthetic glucocorticoids are pharmaceutical compounds prescribed in human and veterinary medicine as anti-inflammatory agents and have the potential to contaminate natural watersheds via inputs from wastewater treatment facilities and confined animal-feeding operations. Despite this, few studies have examined the effects of this class of chemicals on aquatic vertebrates. To generate data to assess potential risk to the aquatic environment, we used fathead minnow 21-d reproduction and 29-d embryolarvae assays to determine reproductive toxicity and early-life-stage effects of dexamethasone. Exposure to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L in the 21-d test caused reductions in fathead minnow fecundity and female plasma estradiol concentrations and increased the occurrence of abnormally hatched fry. Female fish exposed to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L also displayed a significant increase in plasma vitellogenin protein levels, possibly because of decreased spawning. A decrease in vitellogenin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in liver tissue from females exposed to the high dexamethasone concentration lends support to this hypothesis. Histological results indicate that a 29-d embryolarval exposure to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L caused a significant increase in deformed gill opercula. Fry exposed to 500 mu g dexamethasone/L for 29?d also exhibited a significant reduction in weight and length compared with control fry. Taken together, these results indicate that nonlethal concentrations of a model glucocorticoid receptor agonist can impair fish reproduction, growth, and development. Environ. Toxicol.

AB Nowadays, the scientific community has focused and prioritised research on "emerging pollutants". The term "emerging pollutants" stands for the substances that are released in the environment for which currently no regulations are established for their environmental monitoring. Their occurrence is reported worldwide in a range of aquatic environments, such as lakes, rivers, freshwater catchments, estuaries, reservoirs and marine waters. Nevertheless, due to their large number (ranging in an order of thousands), only few of these compounds are toxicologically evaluated. Published data concerning occurrence and potential toxicological effects is limited. The contamination source of the aquatic environment is mainly the effluents from the sewage treatment plants (STPs). Reliable methods are available for residue analysis of these pollutants down to low ng L-1 levels. However, an urgent need is highlighted for the investigation (primarily in environmental media and following in biological ones) of the toxicity and transformation pathways of all emerging pollutants. The aims of this mini-review are to briefly present: (a) the major classes of emerging pollutants; (b) the reasons why these substances constitute an environmental issue; and (c) developments and applications of environmental analysis in this field.
