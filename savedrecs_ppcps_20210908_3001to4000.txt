AB Chemical synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater must be pretreated before traditional biological treatment to improve the biodegradability of pollutants due to their high concentration and complex composition. This study investigated O-3 and O-3/H2O2 systems to pretreat hydrocortisone wastewater. The optimum treatment efficiency of the O-3 system was achieved under pH value of 5.76, dosage of O-3 of 217.5 mg/L, and reaction time of 90 min. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) was 94% and 92%, respectively. The ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and COD (B/C) increased from 0.066 to 0.310. Moreover, the optimum H2O2/O-3 molar ratio was 0.3 with the optimum pH of 3, and reaction time was reduced to 15 min to reach COD removal efficiency of 67.3% in the O-3/H2O2 oxidation system. Interestingly, isobutanol was assumed to be a good hydroxyl radical trapping agent due to the great decrease of Fenton reagent reaction rate constant. By comparing two different kinetic models, oxidation mechanism could be interpreted by the pseudo first-order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient R-2 above 0.9787. It can be concluded that ozonation system was controlled by both direct oxidation and free radical oxidation, and particularly the later one played a dominant role.

AB The cholesterol-lowering pharmaceutical gemfibrozil is a relevant environmental contaminant because of its frequency of detection in U.S. wastewaters at concentrations which have been shown to disrupt endocrine function in aquatic species. The treatment of gemfibrozil solutions with sodium hypochlorite yielded a 4'-chlorinated gemfibrozil analog (chlorogemfibrozil). In the presence of bromide ion, as is often encountered in municipal wastewater, hypobromous acid generated through a halogen exchange reaction produced an additional 4'-brominated gemfibrozil product (bromogemfibrozil). Standards of chloro- and bromogemfibrozil were synthesized, isolated and characterized using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry was used to follow the in situ halogenation reaction of gemfibrozil in deionized water and wastewater matrices, and to measure levels of gemfibrozil (254 +/- 20 ng/L), chlorogemfibrozil (166 +/- 121 ng/L), and bromogemfibrozil (50 +/- 11 ng/L) in advanced primary wastewater treatment effluent treated by chlorination. Chlorogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of 11-ketotestosterone at 55.1 mu g/L and bromogemfibrozil demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the levels of testosterone at 58.8 mu g/L in vivo in Japanese medaka in a 21 day exposure. These results indicated that aqueous exposure to halogenated degradates of gemfibrozil enhanced the antiandrogenicity of the parent compound in a model fish species, demonstrating that chlorination may increase the toxicity of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface water.

AB A mixture of urban and hospital effluents (50 % v/v) was evaluated for ecotoxicity with an advanced bioassay battery. Mixed effluents were tested before any treatment, after biological treatment alone, and after biological treatment followed by a tertiary ozonation (15 mg O-3/L). Laying a high value on the continuance of organisms' fitness, essential to preserve a healthy receiving ecosystem, the main objective of this study was to combine normalized bioassays with newly developed in vivo and in vitro tests in order to assess alteration of embryo development, growth and reproduction, as well as genotoxic effects in aquatic organisms exposed to complex wastewater effluents. Comparison of the bioassays sensitivity was considered. Contrary to the lack of toxicity observed with normalized ecotoxicity tests, endpoints measured on zebrafish embryos such as developmental abnormalities and genotoxicity demonstrated a residual toxicity in wastewater both after a biological treatment followed or not by a tertiary O-3 treatment. However, the ozonation step allowed to alleviate the residual endocrine disrupting potential measure in the biologically treated effluent. This study shows that normalized bioassays are not sensitive enough for the ecotoxicological evaluation of wastewaters and that there is a great need for the development of suitable sensitive bioassays in order to characterize properly the possible residual toxicity of treated effluents.

AB Biological treatment of saline wastewater is considered unfavorable due to salinity inhibition on microbial activity. In this study, intertidal wetland sediment (IWS) collected from a high saline environment Was investigated: as a novel inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline pharmaceutical wastewater. Two parallel lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR) were set up to compare the organic removal potential of IWS with conventional anaerobic digested sludge (ADS). Under steady-state condition, IWS reactor (R-i) showed organic reduction performance significantly superior to that of ADS reactor (R-a), achieving COD removal efficiency of 71.4 +/- 3.7 and 32.3 +/- 6.1%, respectively. In addition, as revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, a higher relative abundance of methanogenic populations was detected in R-i. A further 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing test was conducted to understand both the bacterial and archaeal community populations in the two AnSBRs. A predominance of halophilic/tolerant microorganisms (class Clostridia of bacteria, genera Methanosarcina, and Methanohalophilus of archaea) in R-i enhanced its organic removal, efficiency. Moreover, several Microbial groups related with degradation of hardly biodegradable compounds (PAHs, n-alkenes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alkanes, etc.) were detected in the IWS. All these findings indicated that IWS is a promising inoculation source for anaerobic treatment of saline wastewater.

AB The transmission and toxicity of metals and metalloids were initially investigated with various nanofiltration (NF) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, under oxic condition, using wastewater effluent and seawater samples. Various metals and metalloids were categorized into three groups according to their properties, such as specific gravity and concentration level, as well as others. The levels of various transition metals and metalloids included in the wastewater effluent and seawater samples were within ng/L-mu g/L range; the concentrations of almost all compounds were substantially reduced to ng/L or a few mu g/L levels after membrane filtrations, as measured by ICP-MS. Toxicity measurements were performed using bioassays, including both the Microtox and daphnia methods, for raw and membrane treated samples of wastewater effluent and seawater. The results indicated that (1) the SWRO membrane exhibited very good removal efficiencies for all metals and metalloids tested, (2) most metals and metalloids tested were efficiently removed by the tight NF membranes employed; however, some metals and metalloids included in seawater were not efficiently removed by the relatively loose NF membrane, (3) based on the Microtox measurements, only the seawater sample treated using the relatively loose NF membrane provided a relatively high toxic unit close to 1.0; otherwise, all other samples (both raw and membrane treated samples) exhibited relatively low toxicities.

AB The pollution of pharmaceutical wastewater has attracted global attention. Photocatalysis is an attractive yet challenging method for the degradation of pharmaceutical residues. Fabricating efficient Z-scheme hetero-junctions with intimate interface contact for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts is a challenge. Herein, novel visible-light-driven direct Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 hetero-junctions with intimate interface contact were successfully synthesized by in situ hydrothermal growth of Bi2WO6 directly on the surface of CuInS2 network-like microspheres, and the content of CuInS2 was optimized. The photocatalytic activity of optimal Z-scheme 15% CuInS2/Bi2WO6 for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC center dot HCl) is more than three times that of bare CuInS2 and 17% higher than that of Bi2WO6, which is attributed that the intimate interface contact can assure excellent interfacial charge transfer abilities. Moreover, Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions are highly stable with no inactivation in photocatalytic cycles. More importantly, real pharmaceutical industry wastewater can be efficiently disposed by Fenton-aided photocatalysis of Z-scheme CuInS2/Bi2WO6 hetero-junctions with COD removal efficiency being 90.5%, which is much higher than the reported results, and thus sets a new performance benchmark for practical application in real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical substances and their residues are increasingly present in the environment. Therefore, attempts at their removal are made by using different processes. Increasingly important among these processes are those modeled on natural phenomena which occur in wetland ecosystems, called technical scale constructed wetlands. Microbial degradation is an important process in these constructed wetlands. The biodegradation of chemicals often involves a complex series of biochemical reactions and usually varies with the microorganisms involved. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and other parameters of wastewater in the microcosm of down- flow constructed wetlands. The Spearman correlation coefficient attained negative values in the case of comparison of the Shannon biodiversity index and the parameters of purified wastewater. This dependence was pronounced. In the case of pharmaceutical substances dosed with wastewater, the Spearman correlation coefficient assumed positive values. The highest value assumed by the Spearman correlation coefficient (0.9) was for the removal of diclofenac and Shannon index values for the planted columns, with a very high relationship. For unplanted columns, this value equaled 0.6. For sulfamethoxazole, the value for planted columns was 0.7, and for unplanted - 0.7. The presence of plants did not have an impact on the Shannon biodiversity index.

AB Widespread detection of numerous micropollutants including aromatic pharmaceuticals in effluents of wastewater treatment plants has prompted much research aimed at efficiently eliminating these contaminants of environmental concerns. In the present work, a novel hybrid bioreactor (HBR) of cross-linked enzymes aggregates of laccase (CLEA-Lac) and polysulfone hollow fiber MF membrane was developed for the elimination of acetaminophen (ACT), mefenamic acid (MFA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) as model aromatic pharmaceuticals. The MF alone showed removals of the three drugs varying approximately from 50 to 90% over the course of 8 h in the filtrate of aqueous solution. Synergistic action of the MF and CLEA-Lac during operation achieved eliminations from aqueous solution of around 99%, nearly 100% and up to 85% for ACT, MFA and CBZ, respectively. Under continuous operation, the HBR demonstrated elimination rates of the drugs from filtered wastewater up to 93% after 72 h for CBZ and near complete elimination of ACT and MFA was achieved within 24 h of treatment. Concomitantly to the drugs eliminations in the wastewater, the CLEA-Lac exhibited 25% residual activity while being continuously recycled with no activity in the filtrate. Meanwhile, the filtrate flowrate showed only minor decline indicating limited fouling of the membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Losing streams that are influenced by wastewater treatment plant effluents and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) can be a source of groundwater contamination. Released micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupters and other ecotoxicologically relevant substances as well as inorganic wastewater constituents can reach the groundwater, where they may deteriorate groundwater quality. This paper presents a method to quantify exfiltration mass flow rates per stream length unit M-ex of wastewater constituents from losing streams by the operation of integral pumping tests (IPTs) up- and downstream of a target section. Due to the large sampled water volume during IPTs the results are more reliable than those from conventional point sampling. We applied the method at a test site in Leipzig (Germany). Wastewater constituents K+ and NO3- showed M-ex values of 1241 to 4315 and 749 to 924 mg m(stream)(-1) d(-1), respectively, while Cl- (16.8 to 47.3 g m(stream)(-1) d(-1)) and SO42- (20.3 to 32.2 g m(stream)(-1) d(-1)) revealed the highest observed M-ex values at the test site. The micropollutants caffeine and technical-nonylphenol were dominated by elimination processes in the groundwater between upstream and downstream wells. Additional concentration measurements in the stream and a connected sewer at the test site were performed to identify relevant processes that influence the concentrations at the IPT wells.

AB This study investigates the application of a photocatalytic process involving fly ash (FA) as a Fenton-like catalyst (without iron) for the removal of paracetamol (Para) in water. The active sites in Fenton-type reactions were found to be the trace metals in FA such as nickel, copper, and manganese. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies of the synergic process (UV-FA + H2O2) were compared with UV alone, FA, FA + UV, FA + H2O2, and H2O2 alone. Moreover, the effect of different pH, catalyst dose, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, and the effect of hydrogen peroxide dose was investigated. Para removal efficiency by different processes were found out to be Fly ash + UV + H2O2 > Fly ash + H2O2 > Fly ash > Fly ash + UV > UV. The adsorption of para on fly ash was found to have no significant effect on removal efficiencies. The optimum conditions were found out to be pH = 3, 8 mM concentration of H2O2, 0.2 g dose of fly ash for the synergic process. Although the synergic process was the best at pH 3, however, even near wastewater pH it was found to be effective. It is therefore concluded that fly ash + UV + H2O2 based synergic process is effective for the removal of pharmaceuticals even near wastewater pH.

AB Recently it has been proposed to use sensors based on genetically engineered reporter cells to perform continuous online water monitoring. Here we describe the design, assembly and performance of a novel flow-through device with immobilized genetically modified yeast cells that produce a fluorescent protein upon stimulation with diclofenac whose intensity is then detected by fluorescence microscopy. Although other devices employing immobilized cells for the detection of various analytes have already been described before, as novelty our system allows safe enclosure of the sensor cells, and thus, to obtain fluorescent signals that are not falsified by a loss of cells. Furthermore, the yeast cells are prevented from being released into the environment. Despite the safe containment, the immobilized reporter cells are accessible to nutrients and analytes. They thus have both the ability to grow and respond to the analyte. Both in cell culture medium and standardized synthetic wastewater, we are able to differentiate between diclofenac concentrations in a range from 10 to 100 mu M. As particularly interesting feature, we show that only the biologically active fraction of diclofenac is detected. Nowadays, contamination of wastewater with diclofenac and other pharmaceutical residues is becoming a severe problem. Our investigations may pave the way for an easy-to-use and cost-efficient wastewater monitoring method.

AB A simple and effective method was developed for norfloxacin detection using an innovative magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (MMIP) with the aid of computer simulation. The best two functional monomers are selected according to the docking results. Four kinds of MMIP were synthesized with different functional monomers (methylacrylic acid and acrylamide) and solvents (dimethylsulfoxide and ethanol). The zeta potential was introduced to explain the interaction mechanism between MMIP and norfloxacin when the pH system was optimized. The final MMIP (MMIP-1) possesses a high efficiency recognition for norfloxacin (163.07 mu g mg(-1)) because of the thin layer of MIP (30 nm). Transmission electron microscopy shows uniform morphology for MMIP-1 (460 nm) with a core-shell structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry were used to study the chemical groups and magnetic properties of the materials. MMIP-1 possesses a high imprinting factor (greater than 3). A possible mechanism for the adsorption behavior was briefly explained with the Freundlich model and rate controlled steps. Simulated pharmaceutical wastewater was used for method validation and the method was then used to research using the method with real pharmaceutical wastewater. Because of its good properties, MMIP-1 proved to be an effective material when applied for norfloxacin extraction in complex pharmaceutical wastewater with detection using high performance chromatography.

AB This study analyzed 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in two rivers with different urbanization levels in the surrounding watershed (urban and suburb) in Beijing, China. Along the rivers, effluent samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and wastewater samples from direct discharge outlets were also collected to reveal their possible contribution to the occurrence of PPCPs in these two rivers. Among the 15 PPCPs, 14 compounds were detected with caffeine (maximum 11 900 ng L-1) being the dominant compound. The total concentration of the detected PPCPs in direct discharge outlets (median 4706 ng L-1) was much higher than that in river waters (2780 ng L-1) and WWTP effluents (1971 ng L-1). The suburban-influenced Liangshui River had significantly higher PPCP concentrations compared to the urban-influenced Qing River due to more input of untreated wastewater from direct discharge outlets. Source apportionment showed that approximately 55% of the total PPCPs were contributed by untreated wastewater in the suburban-influenced river. Finally, ecological risk assessment has been regarded as a necessary part of general research. According to the environmental risk assessment results, caffeine, trimethoprim and metoprolol were found to be the most critical compounds, due to their high risk quotient values. The results of the present study can provide useful information for future PPCP pollution control and sustainable water management in Beijing, China.

AB The persistence of acesulfame (ACE) in wastewater treatment (and subsequently the aquatic environment) has led to its use as a marker substance for wastewater input into surface water and groundwater. However, ACE degradation of >85% during summer and autumn was observed in nine German wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Annual removal performance was more stable in larger plants, enhanced by low biological oxygen demand and impeded by water temperatures below 10 degrees C. Literature data suggest that the potential to degrade ACE emerged in WWTPs around the year 2010. This development is ongoing, as illustrated by ACE content in the German rivers Elbe and Mulde: Between 2013 and 2016 the ACE mass load decreased by 70-80%. In enrichment cultures with ACE as sole carbon source the carbonaceous fraction of ACE was removed completely, indicating catabolic biotransformation and the inorganic compound sulfamic acid formed in quantitative amounts. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes suggests that several species are involved in ACE degradation, with proteobacterial species affiliated to Phyllobacteriaceae, Methylophilaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Pseudomonas becoming specifically enriched. ACE appears to be the first micropollutant for which the evolution of a catabolic pathway in WWTPs has been witnessed. It can yet only be speculated whether the emergence of ACE removal in WWTPs in different regions of the world is due to independent evolution or to global spreading of genes or adapted microorganisms.

AB Every day a large amount of products has been released by chemical and pharmaceutical industries threatening the environment and human health. Moreover, their removal using conventional oxidation methods is difficult because a lot of pollutants are biorecalcitrant. Photocatalysis, an advanced oxidation technology, appears one of the most viable solutions due to its ability to oxidize a wide range of toxic organic compounds into harmless compounds such as CO2 and H2O by irradiation with UV light. Organic pollutants can be removed from water by a UV-driven photocatalytic process involving nanoparticles with semiconducting properties. However, their use in a photoreaction system suffers of the disadvantage due to the no-uniform photon distribution inside the reactor core. The chapter describes a possible solution for enhancing the photon distribution inside the photoreactors, using inorganic and organic light-emitting particles (phosphors) coupled with photocatalysts to be applied in water and wastewater treatment. The chapter also underlines the difference between inorganic particles having down-conversion, up-conversion, and long-afterglow luminescence properties. Additionally, the use of up-conversion organic phosphors has been proposed. Finally, some examples concerning the use of semiconductors coupled with different photoluminescent materials in the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater are presented.

AB A wastewater coming from a pharmaceutical plant of chemical organic synthesis with a TOC of ca 1.4 g/L and low biodegradability has been treated by coupling of advanced Fenton oxidation process and subsequent biological treatment. The influence of the reaction temperature, the hydrogen peroxide concentration and the iron/copper loadings as catalysts in the Fenton process were studied. A moderate oxidant concentration (7.5 mgH(2)O(2)/ mgTOC) and a temperature of 70 degrees C enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater with a TOC reduction of ca. 35%. A subsequent biological treatment operating with HRT and SRT of 2 days and 20 days, respectively, allowed increasing the TOC removal above 90%. The oxidant concentration and the reaction temperature of Fenton process as pre-treatment to increase biodegradability were significantly lower than the values of the Fenton process currently implemented in the pharmaceutical plant to achieve an almost complete mineralization of the organic matter (21.4 mgH(2)O(2)/mgTOC and 120 degrees C, respectively). The techno-economical evaluation of the coupling Fenton/biological system compared to the Fenton process as unique treatment, showed that the lower oxidant uptake of the Fenton process for the coupling system is economically more profitable than using an excess of oxidant and a higher reaction temperature for the intensive Fenton process.

AB Erioglaucine (CAS No. 3844-45-9) is a widely used acid aminotriphenylmethane dye of an intense blue color. Erioglaucine containing wastewater streams are not affected by activated sludge treatment plants. Therefore, pretreatment is necessary before discharging. In the industry the standard procedure is to use NaOCl for this purpose. Experiments showed that wastewater treated with this method could contain between 100 and 200 mg l(-1) of adsorbable organic chlorine (AOX) compounds of a questionable ecotoxicological relevance. Alternative treatment methods with reagents containing H2O2 have been investigated. The experimental results are assessed in terms of color and DOC reduction, H2O2 consumption, and enhancement of biodegradability. A combination of activated carbon and H2O2 proved not to be a viable alternative. Treatment with Fentons reagent (H2O2 and Fe2+) was found to be effective in terms of color removal as well as enhanced biodegradability. in the optimum operating range of pH and H2O2/Fe2+ ratio 5 mi of a 35% H2O2 solution are sufficient for the treatment of Ig Erioglaucine. Between 10 and 40 degrees C, the reaction is completed in less than 4h. The environmental effects of the Erioglaucine degradation with Fentons reagent are small compared with the NaOCl treatment. Therefore, oxidation of Erioglaucine containing wastewater with NaOCl should be replaced by a treatment with Fentons reagent. The assumption is that the results obtained for Erioglaucine also apply to other structurally related aminotriphenyl dyes.

AB This study assessed the performances of Fenton, ultraviolet/Fenton, ultrasound/Fenton and tri-hybrid process to remove COD from actual pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. This is the first data set on this type of wastewater yet assembled. Individual Fenton oxidation process shows fair COD removal efficiency (41.1%) under below optimum conditions: the mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+ of 4:1, the initial pH value of 4, Fe2+ dosage of 0.01 mol L-1. The ultraviolet/Fenton treatment showed a better COD removal efficiency than using Fenton alone which can be explained by the fact of synergetic effect. The combination of ultrasound with 60-minute Fenton oxidation provides greater COD removal efficiency, 61.1%, than that of ultrasound alone (48%) and Fenton oxidation alone (41.1%) which suggests that the combination of two individual processes can produce a synergistic effect. The tri-processes hybrid method can significantly increase the COD removal efficiency compared to that of individual and bi-process combination. Increasing UV exposure time can significantly increase the COD removal efficiency. Increasing of FeSO4 concentration the COD removal first increased at the range of 0.002-0.01 mol L-1 and then slightly decreased at higher concentrations. The highest COD removal rate, 91%, was found at the tri-hybrid process with 120 minutes ultrasound, 90-minute UV irradiation at the FeSO4 concentration of 0.01 mol L-1.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are becoming increasingly recognised as important micropollutants to be monitored in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), since WWTP effluents represent an important point source to natural aquatic systems. In this study, the abundance of 65 PPCPs was analysed in 5 Portuguese WWTPs during the spring and autumn. Due to the fact that analytical approaches normally used to quantify the abundance of these compounds are labour intensive and require various specific procedures, this study proposes a set of simplified analytical methods for the quantification of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and polycyclic musks in liquid and sludge samples. The analytical methods were validated using influent wastewater matrices, showing comparable limits of detection and quantification as literature values for most PPCPs, with the exception of the estrogenic compounds. The PhAC concentrations detected in the WWTP survey were in the range of 0.050-100 mu g L-1 in the influent and up to 50 mu g L-1 in the effluent, where the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most abundant and frequently detected group. Some musks were detected up to 11.5 mu g L-1 in the influent and 0.9 mu g L-1 in the effluent, and adsorbed in the sludge up to 22.6 mu g g(-1).

AB Effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) are complex mixtures of chemicals including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2). The objective of this study was to evaluate selected responses of two fish species, in two different years, exposed in situ to MWTP effluent. Biological markers of exposure (plasma vitellogenin (VTG) and antioxidant enzymes) were measured in two species of male fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), caged at sites associated with wastewater outfall. The estrogenicity of the final effluent in 2010 was determined to be 17.0 + 0.4 ng/L estrogen equivalents (EEQ) and reduced to 7.5 + 2.9 ng/L EEQ after infrastructure upgrades. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the effluent and surface water in both years confirmed the exposures at each downstream site. Despite the presence of estrogenic compounds in the MWTP effluent, no effluent-caged male fish demonstrated plasma VTG induction. Minnows and trout that received an intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/g EE2 showed VTG induction at both field sites. In 2012, the liver somatic index (LSI) of both species increased with exposure, as did changes in antioxidant enzymes, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. Multiple biological mechanisms are modified by effluent exposure, and multiple endpoints are needed to assess risk.

AB Polyether ionophore antibiotics such as Lasalocid A, Salinomycin and Semduramicin, which are used a lot in veterinary medicine, have high toxicity among other antibiotics. They cannot be eliminated by conventional wastewater treatment and leak into surface and ground water which can have detrimental damage on aquatic environment. Membrane processes like ultrafiltration can be a solution as tertiary and advanced treatment for this issue. Unfortunately, they can be easily fouled by dissolved substances. In this study, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were used as novel antifouling agents and chemically coated on the amidoximated membranes with different half generations (G0-G2.5). New membranes exhibited great performances in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater with these antibiotics. G2.5 PAMAM-coated ultrafiltration membranes were selected as optimum membranes with 120.4 L/m(2).h of pure water flux, 91.3% of Semduramicin rejection, low contact angle (51.2?) and zeta potential (-56.1 mV). The flux profiles of these membranes revealed that the flux reduction does not occur after 1-1.5 h of filtration. These profiles were fitted by power law model. In addition to the surface charge and pore size, the branches of dendrimers, which had negative charges, acted great roles during the filtration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanofiltration (NF) has great potential in removing trace organic micropollutants in wastewater, especially pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, little information is available on PPCPs rejections under complex feed water matrices, which better represent real wastewater treatment conditions. In this paper, the PPCPs rejection behaviors and the dominating mechanisms by NF membranes were studied under multi mixed influent matrices which contained various inorganic ions, humic acids and sodium alginate. The results showed that the DF30 membrane had the highest rejection of negatively charged indomethacin (95.4%) and diclofenac sodium (94.1%) in pure water. Our study also showed that electrostatic effect and steric hindrance were the primary rejection mechanisms of PPCPs by DF30 membrane in pure water. The predominant fouling of DF30 membrane could be explained by the complete blocking model in the filtration of mixed influent matrices containing both inorganic ions and organic matters. The components in membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent was beneficial to retention of positively and neutrally charged PPCPs, but had no significant effects on retention of negatively charged PPCPs. Risk quotients of the six target PPCPs in NF effluent were all lower than 0.1, likely indicating low risk to aquatic organisms. This work has potential implications for a deeper understanding of PPCPs rejections by NF in wastewater treatment.

AB This work compares the removal of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ubiquitous antioxidant in food and pharmaceuticals, from water either by electrocoagulation (EC) with an Fe/Fe cell or H2O2-based electrochemical advanced oxidation processes like electrochemical oxidation (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectroFenton (PEF) with an air-diffusion cathode. BHA degradation by EC was very poor, whereas the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was more effectively abated in urban wastewater. The effect of pH, number of Fe/Fe pairs and current on the EC performance was examined. The additive was also slowly degraded by EO-H2O2 with a RuO2 based or BDD anode in 50mM Na2SO4 solution. In the simulated matrix, BHA decay by EO-H2O2 was substantially enhanced owing to active chlorine generation from anodic oxidation of Cl-, whereas the center dot OH-mediated oxidation at the BDD surface accounted for DOC decay. In EF and PEF, the center dot OH produced in the bulk upgraded the mineralization, primordially using BDD. In raw urban wastewater at natural pH 7.9, the time course of BHA and DOC contents was affected by NOM oxidation, being accelerated in the order: EO-H2O2 < EF < PEF. The quickest decontamination of urban wastewater occurred in PEF at pH 3.0, because of the higher amounts of center dot OH in the bulk along with WA photolysis.

AB Monitoring and quantification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the environment constitute important and challenging tasks, as they are directly associated with human health. Three commonly used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), namely, omeprazole sodium (OMP), pantoprazole sodium (PNT), and lansoprazole sodium (LNZ) are well separated and quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in pharmaceutical industrial wastewater. The separation of the studied drugs was performed on a stationary phase with a Waters(TM) column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m). The mobile phase was composed of methanol:0.05 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 7.5 using NaOH) (50:50, v/v). The elution process was done in gradient mode by changing the relative proportions of the mobile phase components with time to get an optimum separation pattern. The flow rate of the developing system was adjusted to 0.8 mL/minute. Detection of the separated drugs was performed at 230 nm. The studied drugs were quantified in the concentration range of 10-200 ng/mL for all drugs. The cited method was fully validated according to the international conference on harmonization (ICH-Q2B) guidelines, then it was applied successfully for quantification of the studied PPIs in real wastewater samples after their solid phase extraction (SPE).

AB This study evaluates the influence of UV dose on degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) in wastewater under UV-C (lambda = 254 nm) photolysis with and without H2O2. The rate of degradation of CBZ exhibited a direct dependence on the intensity of incident UV irradiation as the rate of degradation was observed to increase linearly (R-2 = 0.98) with UV intensity between 1.67 and 8.95 x 10(17) photons/s. More than 95% of the CBZ that spiked in wastewater rapidly degraded within 4 min with a first-order rate constant of 1.2 min(-1) for an optimum H2O2 dose of 100 mg/L. Bench-scale continuous flow reactor experiments also showed that CBZ degraded with first-order kinetics at a rate constant of 1.02 min(-1). The kinetic parameters obtained for a continuous bench-scale reactor were in good agreement with the relationships developed through batch experiments with only a marginal deviation of +/- 6.5%. The relationship between UV intensity and CBZ degradation rate obtained in this study was extrapolated to the UV disinfection unit of a wastewater treatment plant to predict possible degradation of CBZ during UV disinfection. The addition of 100 mg/L of H2O2 to the secondary-treated effluent entering the UV disinfection unit is predicted to achieve over 60% degradation of CBZ.

AB Despite contributing 75% of the total wastewater flow to domestic sewers, little is currently known concerning the detailed production patterns and characteristics of grey wastewater. In this study, an inventory of the consumption of household chemicals including a diary survey of water-consuming activities was carried out over seven consecutive days in a block of flats. In total 290 parameters in 92 household chemicals were registered in the inventory in which 30 out of 38 tenants participated. The study was accompanied by quantitative analyses of selected parameters and a screening for organic components in grey wastewater. More than 190 individual components were identified by GC-MS. Identified substances were grouped into eight substance classes based on their application and their concentrations were semi-quantitatively assessed. Several fragrances like citronellol, hexyl cinnamic aldehyde and menthol as well as some preservatives, e.g. citric acid and triclosan, were identified. The measurements also showed that unwanted and unexpected compounds like drugs and pesticides could be present, as well as chemicals not directly deriving from household chemicals or personal care products, e.g. flame-retardants. The inventory provided detailed information about the consumption of various types of household chemicals, but no information on compound concentrations could be assessed due to the limited data in the list of contents of the household chemicals. It was shown that tracking of potentially toxic compounds used in households was possible.

AB The water quality of the effluents is mainly focused on physicochemical and microbiological parameters. However, the ecotoxicological assessments are crucial to ensure an effective water quality of the effluents. This work aims to assess the ecotoxicity of effluents originated from WWTPs with different wastewater treatment technologies. For that, effluent samples from three WWTPs with different treatment processes were seasonally collected. Physicochemical parameters were determined, the toxicity towards daphnia, protozoan, and microalgae organisms was evaluated, and data correlated. Toxicity assays showed different susceptibility of the organisms to the effluents and that toxicity is dependent on the season and wastewater treatment technology. No toxicity was observed to daphnia in winter and spring, but similar to 100% of mortality was observed in effluent from WWTP A in summer. Growth inhibition was observed for both protozoan and microalgae for all effluents and in all seasons with highest values in spring in WWTP C (similar to 80%) for the protozoan while the highest microalgae growth inhibition percentage was observed for WWTP B in both spring (similar to 80%) and summer (similar to 80%). These results show that effluents might have negative impacts into their receiving water systems and highlight that a global assessment of effluent quality should include ecotoxicological assays to complement physicochemical and microbiological data for an operative environmental management of wastewater treatment plants.

AB Inadequate treatment of hospital wastewater could result in considerable risks to public health due to its macro- and micropollutant content. In order to eliminate this problem, a new nanoparticle composite was produced under laboratory conditions and a photocatalytic degradation approach was used. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP) (macro) and oflaxin (micro) pollutant removal were investigated with the nano graphene oxide magnetite (Nano-GO/M) particles by two different processes, namely adsorption and photodegradation. Low removal efficiencies (21-60%) were obtained in the adsorption process for the parameters given above, after 90 min contact time at a pH of 7.8 with 5 g/L Nano-GO/M composite. Using the photodegradation process, higher removal efficiencies were obtained with 2 g/L Nano-GO/M composite for COD (88%), TSS (82%), TKN (95%) and oflaxin (97%), at pH 7.8 after 60 min irradiation time at a UV power of 300 W. The synthesized nanoparticle was reused for two sequential treatments of pharmaceutical wastewater with no significant losses of removal efficiencies (for oflaxin 97%-90%). The quality of the treated hospital wastewater was first class according to the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulations criteria. This water could also be used for irrigation purposes.

AB A novel technology for enhanced municipal wasterwater treatment was assessed based on the dual functions of Fe(VI) to oxidize micropollutants and remove phosphate by formation of ferric phosphates. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reactions of selected pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, and organic model compounds with Fe(VI) were in the range of 1 (trimethylamine) to 9000 M-1 s(-1) (aniline) in the pH-range 7-8. The selected compounds contained electron-rich moieties (ERM) such as phenols, anilines, amines, and olefins. Oxidation experiments in wastewater spiked with micropollutants at concentrations in the low mu M range at pH 7 and 8 showed that Fe(VI) doses higher than 5 mg Fe L-1 are capable of eliminating various ERM-containing micropollutants by more than 85%. In comparison to ozone, Fe(VI) was. as effective or slightly less effective in terms of micropollutants oxidation, with Fe(VI) having the benefit of phosphate removal. To lower phosphate from 3.5 to 0.8 mg PO4-P L-1 (regulatory limit for wastewater discharge in Switzerland), a Fe(VI) dose of 7.5 mg Fe L-1 was needed. Overall, this study demonstrates Fe(VI) as a promising tool for an enhanced wastewater treatment to remove micropollutants as well as to control phosphate in a single treatment step.

AB Pharmaceuticals are a subset of micropollutants, present in the environment in trace concentrations. Because of their persistent nature, these chemicals are of particular concern. Little is known about how mixtures of pharmaceutical residues, found in WWTP effluents, affect the environment or public health. Yet, numerous studies show negative outcomes for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms, suggesting that they are given both to bioaccumulation and uptake in plants. Israel leads the world in effluent reuse (86%), almost exclusively utilized for purposes of agricultural irrigation. Pharmaceuticals, however, are not included in Israel's water regulatory oversight or management, essentially creating an epidemiological experiment among its citizens and environment. Globally, these compounds also are not commonly subject to monitoring or regulation. This study reviews and analyzes water policies and regulation worldwide that address the presence of pharmaceuticals in water resources, with a particular focus on Australia, Singapore, Switzerland, and the USA. Furthermore, the study investigates the reasons why these chemicals are not yet regulated in Israel. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the data and analysis of the regulatory rationale in other countries, a list of recommended pharmaceutical standards that should be measured and monitored in Israel's wastewater treatment system is proposed. The suggested prioritization criteria should be at the heart of a new regulatory agenda for controlling pharmaceutical contamination in wastewater.

AB This study assessed the effects and removal options of the macrolide spiramycin, currently used for both in human and veterinary medicine- with a special focus on advanced oxidation processes based on heterogeneous TiO(2)(- )assisted photocatalysis. spiramycin real concentrations were investigated on a seasonal basis in a municipal waste-water treatment plant (up to 35 mu g L-1), while its removal kinetics were studied considering both aqueous solutions and real wastewater samples, including by-products toxicity assessment. High variability of spiramycin removal by activated sludge treatments (from 9% (wintertime) to >99.9% (summertime)) was observed on a seasonal basis. Preliminary results showed that a total spiramycin removal (>99.9%) is achieved with 0.1 g L-1 of TiO2 in aqueous solution after 80 min. Integrated toxicity showed residual slight acute effects in the photocatalytic treated solutions, independently from the amount of TiO2 used, and could be linked to the presence of intermediate compounds. Photolysis of wastewater samples collected after activated sludge treatment during summer season (SPY 5 mu g L-1) allowed a full SPY removal after 80 min. When photocatalysis with 0.1 g L-1 of TiO2 was carried out in wastewater samples collected in winter season (SPY 30 mu g L-1) after AS treatment, SPY removal was up to 91% after 80 min.

AB Four water samples collected using standard depth and width water-column sampling methodology were compared to an innovative passive, in situ, sampler (the polar organic chemical integrative sampler or POCIS) for the detection of 96 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) in a stream that receives agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastewaters. Thirty-two OWCs were identified in POCIS extracts whereas 9 24 were identified in individual water-column samples demonstrating the utility of POCIS for identifying contaminants whose occurrence are transient or whose concentrations are below routine analytical detection limits. Overall, 10 OWCs were identified exclusively in the POCIS extracts and only six solely identified in the water-column samples, however, repetitive water samples taken using the standard method during the POCIS deployment period required multiple trips to the sampling site and an increased number of samples to store, process, and analyze. Due to the greater number of OWCs detected in the POCIS extracts as compared to individual water-column samples, the ease of performing a single deployment as compared to collecting and processing multiple water samples, the greater mass of chemical residues sequestered, and the ability to detect chemicals which dissipate quickly, the passive sampling technique offers an efficient and effective alternative for detecting OWCs in our waterways for wastewater contaminants.

AB The use of recycled glass as a substrate for constructed wetlands was assessed through two studies. The first study examined the dissipation of atenolol, carbamazepine, and sulfamethoxazole in mesocosm-modeled wetlands using glass or limestone gravel as substrates, with or without cattails (Typha spp.). Following pseudo-first-order kinetics, atenolol dissipated the fastest from the water surface of the mesocosms (t(1/2)similar to 1 day), followed by sulfamethoxazole (t(1/2)similar to 14 days), and carbamazepine (t(1/2)similar to 48 days), with no significant differences across treatments. Increased half-lives were observed at greater depth, likely due to light screening. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis diagnosed sunlight absorption rates and second-order hydroxyl-mediated indirect photolysis rates to be the main sources of uncertainty in our dissipation rate estimates, compared to our observed rates. The second study examined in situ pharmaceutical removal in tertiary pilot-scale subsurface filters made of crushed recycled glass or sand in a wastewater treatment facility in Manitoba, Canada. Glass and sand showed no significant differences for pharmaceutical removals; atenolol and metoprolol were removed below limits of detection, while carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole persisted over a retention time of 24 h. Overall, recycled glass performed similarly to traditional substrates for wetland-based wastewater treatment.

AB Cytostatics are a major class of chemotherapy drugs with great potential to cause genotoxic and/or mutagenic effects in all organisms. Currently, hospital wastewater treatment systems (HWTS) are not able to remove these compounds and they are discharged to the environment. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the oxidative degradation of the cytostatic drugs doxorubicin ( DOXO) [(8s, 10s)-10-(4-amino-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-tetrahydro-2h-pyran-2-yloxy)-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrotetracene-5,12-dione] and methotrexate (METHO) {N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid} by ozonolysis alone and using a combined sonolysis/ozonolysis process on bench-scale at different pH values. Besides determining the degradation efficiency, a kinetic approach was applied to determine the reaction order and rate constants for different oxidative processes carried out at pH 7.0, which is the normal pH of hospital wastewater. The results showed that the removal efficiency of these compounds is pH-dependent. A combination of sonolysis and ozonolysis processes is more efficient than the ozonolysis process alone for the degradation of doxorubicin at all pH values, while methotrexate can easily be degraded by ozonolysis alone or sonolysis/ozonolysis methodologies at any pH.

AB With limited budgets, utilities may forego potable reuse of municipal wastewater to meet regulations requiring nitrate and contaminant removal from discharges. At 85% recovery, reverse osmosis (RO)-based potable reuse rejects contaminants into a concentrate flowrate that is 6.7-fold lower than wastewater discharges. This study evaluated the footprint and cost savings associated with treating nitrate and contaminants in RO concentrate vs. wastewater effluent. Pilot-scale ozone and biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment of RO concentrate provided design parameters needed for this comparison. Addition of 60 mg C per L methanol as a carbon source was needed to achieve complete denitrification of 70 mg N per L nitrate within a 30 min BAC empty bed contact time. Combined with pre-ozonation at 0.5 mg O-3/mg DOC, this treatment removed >74% of fipronil, imidacloprid, atenolol, DEET and sulfamethoxazole. Estimates indicated that applying ozone/BAC treatment to RO concentrate rather than conventional wastewater effluent for contaminant removal prior to discharge would offset 60% of the footprint and 25% of the cost required for the RO-based potable reuse train. Considering these savings, the reuse train cost could be recouped if the product water were sold at rates below those current in southern California. These results suggest synergy rather than competition between potable reuse and contaminant removal.

AB Four pilot-scale constructed wetlands (free water surface, SF; horizontal subsurface flow, HSF; vertical subsurface flows with different water level, VSF-L and VSF-H) were operated to assess their ability to remove sulfamethazine (SMZ) and tetracycline (TC) from wastewaters, and to investigate the abundance level of corresponding resistance genes (sulI, sulII, tetM, tetW and tetO) in the CWs. The results indicated that CWs could significantly reduce the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater, and the mass removal rate range of SMZ and TC were respectively 11%-95% and 85%-95% in the four systems on the basis of hydraulic equilibrium; further relatively high removal rate was observed in VSF with low water level. Seasonal condition had a significant effect on SMZ removal in the CWs (especially SMZ in SF), but TC removal in VSFs were not considered to have statistically significant differences in winter and summer. At the end period, the relative abundances of target genes in the CWs showed obvious increases compared to initial levels, ranging from 2.98 x 10(-5) to 1.27 x 10(-1) for sul genes and 4.68 x 10(-6) to 1.54 x 10(-1) for tet genes after treatment, and those abundances showed close relation to both characteristic of wastewater and configuration of CWs.

AB A three-phase hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) method was evaluated for the extraction and preconcentration of naproxen and diclofenac using a polypropylene membrane followed by analysis using HPLC or LC/MS. In this technique, the drugs were extracted into di-n-hexyl ether immobilized in the wall pores of a porous hollow fiber from 50mL of sludge slurry sample as a donor phase with pH 3, and then back-extracted into the acceptor phase located in the lumen of the hollow fiber. Experimental factors were studied in 16 trials using a Taguchi orthogonal array experimental design with an OA(16) (4(5)) matrix. The significance of these factors was investigated using analysis of variance. The extraction time was statistically demonstrated as the main factor for the extraction of naproxen and diclofenac, while ionic strength played the role of the second most important factor for HF-LPME extraction of diclofenac. The method permitted a detection limit of 0.2-0.7ngg(-1) with relative standard deviation values of 3-5%. Enrichment factors of 2,300 for naproxen and 1,400 for diclofenac were achieved. The method was applied to determine naproxen and diclofenac in sewage sludge from sewage treatment plant, Kallby (Lund, Sweden).

AB In this study, seasonal variations in the concentration profile of four analgesics and one lipid regulator were monitored on their way from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, along a river, and into a lake.
   From December 2007 to December 2008, water samples were collected monthly (n = 12) from an upstream point, the effluent, four downstream points of the WWTP, and at the point where the river merges with the lake, and the concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and ketoprofen were determined. The analytical methodology involved solid-phase extraction of the target compounds from water samples followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for compound separation and detection.
   The studied pharmaceuticals were found in the effluent at concentrations ranging from 31 to 1,852 ng l(-1) depending on the season. In the river and lake, the concentrations were much lower (6-400 ng l(-1)) mainly due to dilution but also to a season-dependent contribution from natural transformation processes. The mean mass flow of all analgesics was highest during winter while the highest mean mass flow of the lipid regulator bezafibrate was observed in spring.
   The WWTP is the main source of the target compounds in the aquatic environment. The observed winter accumulation signifies the importance of natural transformation processes, which can only be estimated based on mass flow data, on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.

AB The persistence and fate of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been investigated in laboratory-scale experiments, including studies with various aqueous solutions, water/sediment systems, and activated sludge-amended medium. The samples were placed in the dark and/or in a growth chamber fitted with fluorescent lamps simulating the ultraviolet output of sunlight. Over a period of 30 d, fluoxetine was hydrolytically and photolytically stable in all aqueous solutions except synthetic humic water (pH 7), in which the degradation rate was increased by approximately 13-fold in comparison with buffered solutions at the same pH. Fluoxetine rapidly dissipated from the aqueous phase in water/sediment systems, primarily because of distribution to sediments. The dissipation rate from the aqueous phase was similar between light and dark systems, indicating a low contribution of photodegradation to the dissipation of fluoxetine in this system. The potential impact of fluoxetine in aquatic environments would be decreased because of adsorption to sediments. Based on results of ready-biodegradability investigations, fluoxetine would not be expected to rapidly biodegrade in wastewater treatment plants. A photoproduct was detected only in a sample of synthetic humic water and was identified as norfluoxetine formed by demethylation. Results indicate that fluoxetine is relatively recalcitrant to hydrolysis, photolysis, and microbial degradation and that it is rapidly removed from surface waters by adsorption to sediment, where it appears to be persistent.

AB In the current study, the Fe2O3/biochar nanocomposite was synthesized through a self-assembly method, followed by the immobilization of Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) on its surface to produce the P. putida/Fe2O3/biochar magnetic innovative nanocomposite. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized using different techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Then, the efficiencies of this material to remove calconcarboxylic acid (CCA) organic dye, ammonium ions (NH4+), and phosphate ions (PO43-) from industrial wastewater were analyzed. The removal rates of up to 82%, 95%, and 85% were achieved for CCA dye, PO43-, NH4+, respectively, by the synthesized composite. Interestingly, even after 5 cycles of reuse, the prepared nanocomposite remains efficient in the removal of pollutants. Therefore, the P. putida/Fe3O4/biochar composite was found to be an actual talented nanocomposite for industrial wastewater bioremediation.

AB The adsorption of entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer (AG-AC) was investigated by measuring the removal of organic compounds. The general concept is that the entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer could be used as a low-cost adsorbent for ascorbic acid and lactose removal from industrial wastewater. Ascorbic acid and lactose are the most pharmaceutical wastes that can introduce throughout the industrial process and lead to an increase in the amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater. Different ascorbic acid and lactose concentrations were prepared in the laboratory. The efficient removal is affected by external variables (eg, pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, concentrations, and stirring rate). Percent removal for ascorbic acid and lactose at pH 3 using dose 30 g for 60 minutes with a fixed stirring rate at 100 rpm was about 70% and 50%, respectively. Ascorbic acid and lactose adsorption onto entrapped activated carbon in alginate polymer obey well with Freundlich adsorption isotherm.

Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) concentrations in secondary effluents varied between 90 and 150 ng/L SMX was extracted using SPE and was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. SMX (maximum concentration of 37 ng/L) was detected in the water table region. in two monitoring wells, after an unsaturated zone transport period of about 16 years. The maximum SMX concentration detected in the pumping well was of 20 ng/L These results question wastewater effluent disposal strategies including the suitability of irrigation with effluents on the replenishment area of an aquifer supplying drinking water.

AB The impact of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the biotreatment of a chemical synthesis wastewater emerging from a pharmaceutical industry was studied. The aim of this addition was to decrease inhibitory and non-biodegradable organics. In the first step, PAC was directly added to activated sludge. In the next step, the wastewater was first contacted with PAC and then treated in an activated sludge reactor. COD, oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral measurements were carried out for the evaluation of performance. Direct PAC addition and PAC pretreatment led to similar results, but direct PAC addition was considered more practical than pretreatment with PAC. With the addition of PAC, the level of non-biodegradable matter and the colour of the wastewater were significantly reduced. In any case, the addition of PAC increased the OUR of activated sludge, indicating that inhibition could be decreased. The combined evaluation of OUR, spectral parameters and COD gave a better insight into the processes taking place than the COD parameter alone.

AB Industrial discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment in some middle-and low-income countries is not sufficiently regulated. The phytotoxicity of metronidazole (FLAGYL)one of the most commonly used over the counter (OTC) antibiotics, to soybean (Glycine max) is investigated. Relative growth rate (RGR) expressed in gram per gram per day (gg(-1)d(-1)) was applied to plants destructively harvested at maturity (42 d), to determine the toxicological impact. Differences between mean RGR of the three groups were performed at 0.05 significance level. Multiple comparisons suggest that there was a statistical significant difference among mean RGR for all treatment groups. Metronidazole is toxic to soybean plants (Glycine max) based on dose-response criterion. There is a need to enforce treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater effluent by Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies (PMCs) before discharge into the environment.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Biotransformation of most organic micropollutants (OMPs) during wastewater treatment is not complete and an unexplained steady decrease of the biotransformation rate with time is reported for many OMPs in different biological processes. To minimize and accurately predict the emission of OMPs into the environment, the mechanisms and limitations behind their biotransformations should be clarified. Aiming to achieve this objective, the present study follows a mechanistic modelling approach, based on the formulation of four models according to different biotransformation hypotheses: Michaelis-Menten kinetics, chemical equilibrium between the parent compound and the transformation product (TP), enzymatic inhibition by the TP, and a limited compound bioavailability due to its sequestration in the solid phase. These models were calibrated and validated with kinetic experiments performed in two different anaerobic systems: continuous reactors enriched with methanogenic biomass and batch assays with anaerobic sludge. Model selection was conducted according to model suitability criteria (goodness of fitting the experimental data, confidence of the estimated parameters, and model parsimony) but also considering mechanistic evidences. The findings suggest that reversibility of the biological reactions and/or sequestration of compounds are likely the causes preventing the complete biotransformation of OMPs, and biotransformation is probably limited by thermodynamics rather than by kinetics. Taking into account its simplicity and broader applicability spectrum, the reversible biotransformation is the proposed model to explain the incomplete biotransformation of OMPs.

AB The design criteria for wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the sludge retention time, respectively, have a significant impact on micropollutant removal. The upgrade of an Austrian municipal WWTP to nitrogen removal (best available technology, BAT) resulted in increased elimination of most of the analyzed micropollutants. Substances, such as bisphenol-A, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and the antibiotics erythromycin and roxithromycin were only removed after the upgrade of the WWTP. Nevertheless, the BAT was not sufficient to completely eliminate these compounds. Thus, a pilot scale ozonation plant was installed for additional treatment of the effluent. The application of 0.6 g O-3 g DOC-1 increased the removal of most of the micropollutants, especially for compounds that were not degraded in the previous biological process, as for example carbamazepine and diclofenac. These results indicated that the ozonation of WWTP effluent is a promising technology to further decrease emissions of micropollutants from the treatment process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A Xanthomonas sp. was isolated from the sludge on the drain outlet of a pharmaceutical factory. Then, the bacterium and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were co-attached to an oxygen electrode for rapid analysis of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The response current was linear with BOD values in the range 10 to 300 mg/L for standard BOD solution with a response time of 35 seconds (R = 0.9994) and 20 to 580 mg/ L for pharmaceutical wastewater with a response time <= 200 seconds (R = 0.9985), which means that this modified electrode might be used for online BOD analysis of pharmaceutical wastewater. Further studies revealed that the modified electrode can be used for BOD measurement in a high-salt condition. Also, the bacterium/CNTs biofilm can maintain its activity and good performance, even after being sealed and stored at 4 degrees C for 50 days. Water Environ. Res., 80, 699 (2008).

AB Pharmaceuticals in surface water are a threat to drinking water supplies. The removal of 12 pharmaceuticals was investigated in a full scale constructed wetland processing hospital wastewaters in East Ukraine. Passive integrative samplers POCIS were used to monitor target compounds in the wastewater inlet and outlet at the beginning of the constructed wetland operation in 2012 and three years later in 2015. Pharmaceuticals were effectively removed; however, their removal efficiency differed among the compounds and years of the operation. An increase of removal efficiency was observed for androstenedione, carbamazepine, caffeine, diclofenac, estrone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, propranolol and triclosan with greater water residence time and an increase in macrophyte cover. Removal patterns of pharmaceuticals were discussed based on specific physical chemical properties of molecules, changes in the operational conditions of the constructed wetland and inlet pollutant concentrations. Further research is needed to fully understand how the maturation of constructed wetlands influences the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater.

AB The degradation of a pharmaceutical wastewater using a ferrioxalate-assisted solar/photo-Fenton system has been studied. The photochemical reaction was carried out in a pilot plant consisting of a compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar reactor. An optimization study was performed combining a multivariate experimental design and Neuronal Networks that included the following variables: initial concentrations of H2O2, catalyst Fe (II) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4), temperature and solar power. Under optimal conditions, 84% TOC (Total Organic Carbon) removal was achieved in 115 min. Oxalic acid had a positive effect on mineralization when solar power was above 30 W m(-2). The minimum amount of H2O2 to degrade 1 mol of TOC was found to be 3.57 mol. Both the H2O2 conversion efficiency and the degree of mineralization were highest when the oxalic/Fe(II) initial molar relation was close to 3. HO center dot radicals were the main oxidative intermediate species in the process, although hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2 center dot) also played a role. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging contaminants are a wide group of chemical products that are found at low concentrations in the environment. These contaminants can be either natural, e. g., estrogens, or synthetics, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, which can enter the environment through the water and sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The growth of Trametes versicolor on membrane biological reactor (MBR) sludge in bioslurry systems at the Erlenmeyer scale was assessed and its capacity for removing pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) was evaluated. The ability of the fungus to remove hydrochlorothiazide (HZT) from liquid media cultures was initially assessed. Consequently, different bioslurry media (complete nutrient, glucose and no-nutrient addition) and conditions (sterile and non-sterile) were tested, and the removal of spiked HZT was monitored under each condition. The highest spiked HZT removal was assessed under non-sterile conditions without nutrient addition (93.2%). Finally, the removal assessment of a broad set of pharmaceuticals was performed in non-spiked bioslurry. Under non-sterile conditions, the fungus was able to completely degrade 12 out of the 28 drugs initially detected in the MBR sludge, achieving an overall degradation of 66.9%. Subsequent microbial analysis showed that the microbial diversity increased after 15 days of treatment, but there was still some T. versicolor in the bioslurry. Results showed that T. versicolor can be used to remove PPCPs in bioslurry systems under non-sterile conditions, without extra nutrients in the media, and in matrices as complex as an MBR sludge.

AB Enrofloxacin (ENRO), a fluoroquinolone, was quantified in overflows from an animal lot and residential sewage lagoons and in a receiving-stream (Gans Creek). The concentrations of ENRO in samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In total, ninety samples including duplicates were analyzed during several monthly sampling campaigns. The samples collected represented the residential sewage lagoon overflow (RLO), animal lot lagoon overflow (ALLO), the combined overflows (RLO and ALLO), and Gans Creek (upstream, midstream and downstream positions). The frequency of detection of ENRO was 90% for RLO and 100% for both ALLO and Gans Creek. The highest concentration of ENRO (0.44 mu g/L) was found in ALLO sample collected during high precipitation. ENRO levels found in RLO samples ranged from < LOQ to 259 ng/L and the highest value observed also coincided with high flow. The levels of ENRO found in Gans Creek ranged from 17-216 ng/L. A preliminary ecotoxicological assessment was conducted through calculation of the risk quotients (RQs) for organisms based on the ratio of the measured environmental concentrations in this study to the predicted-no-effect-concentrations (acute and chronic effect) data. From the RQs, high risks were observed for Microcystis aeruginosa (cyanobacteria; RQ = 4.4); Anabaena flosaquae (cyanobacteria; RQ = 1.3); and Lemna minor (aquatic vascular plant; RQ = 2.0). The long-term effects of mixtures of PHCs on Gans Creek watershed are probable.

AB A bio-electrochemical reactor (BER) operating at different cathode potentials ranging from - 300 to -1000 mV (vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) was used to reduce adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) in pharmaceutical wastewater. Cathode polarization enriched the electron donor of the biological system. Thus, the AOX removal efficiency in the BER improved from 59.9% to 70.2%, and the AOX removal rate increased from 0.87 to 1.17 mg AOX/h when the cathode potential was reduced from - 300 to - 1000 mV with the addition of methyl viologen, a known redox mediator. The decrease of the cathode potential was also beneficial for methane production, and the inhibition of the methanogenic process enhanced the AOX removal. Additionally, cathode coulombic efficiency analysis demonstrated that the proportion of electrons used for AOX reduction decreases with decreasing potential, from 37.6% at - 300 mV to 17.3% at -1000 mV, although the AOX removal efficiency improves.

AB Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is a promising agent for the adsorptive removal of organic micropollutants (OMP) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Reliable and predictive test methods are required for the selection and for the quality control of PAC. In the present investigation, a pragmatic test method using indicative target OMP and photometric analyses was developed. Eight different PAC were compared according to the test method and according to removals of individual OMP in WWTP effluent. The test method allowed identification of the PAC with the highest and the lowest removals of benzotriazole and elucidated differences of the PAC with regard to removals of individual OMP. In WWTP effluent both positive and negative correlations between OMP removals with different PAC were observed: Some PAC removed diclofenac, carbamazepine and metoprolol to a comparatively greater extent while other PAC are comparably more efficient for benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazole and acesulfame adsorption.

AB Investigation on the sources, discharges and related risks for the environment of the pharmaceutical substance (PhS) diclofenac (DCF) was performed in Lithuania, a country of the Baltic Sea region, for the first time. The investigation only refers to DCF as a PhS for human use; emissions from animal husbandry were not considered. In the first stage of the research, the main sources and pathways of DCF via substance flow analysis were identified within the country. During the second stage, DCF flows along the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two different cities were measured in order to assess the current levels of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. Furthermore, environmental risk assessment was carried out by taking into account the parameters of consumption data and elimination rate in WWTPs. Then, the assessment of different technical and managerial removal approaches was accomplished in an environmental management model of wastewater containing PhS, based on the framework of environmental systems theory.

AB Presence of pathogenic microorganism in anodic effluent of microbial fuel cell (MFC) makes it unfit for reuse. In this study, performance of dual chamber MFC was evaluated in terms of organic matter removal, power generation and disinfection in cathodic chamber. Anodic effluent was treated further in cathodic chamber for achieving disinfection with different doses of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with available chlorine varying from 0.67, 1.32, 2, 3 and 4g/L. Addition of different doses of NaOCl resulted in satisfactory disinfection along with removal of nitrogenous compounds. Power output of MFC improved up to 3 g/L of available chlorine (6.5 W/m(3)); however, further increase in chlorine concentration decreased the power. Voltammetric and impedance analysis showed higher and faster electron reduction and decrease in polarization resistance at 3 g/L dose. Higher organic matter removal from wastewater and complete elimination of microorganism, along with improved power output, demonstrates effectiveness of hypochlorite as catholyte.

AB Diffuse pollution in rural areas due to agricultural runoff is a widespread and difficult problem to address due to the large areas affected. Drainage channels receive polluted water, but its introduction into conventional treatment network is often unfeasible. Within this context, microalgae-based treatment systems could be used as alternative treatment plants. A new design of semi-closed (hybrid) tubular horizontal photobioreactor (HTH-PBR) with low energy requirements has been evaluated for microalgae cultivation at full-scale (8.5 m(3)), using agricultural runoff as feedstock. This novel system was tested in batch and continuous mode over 4 and 135 d. Considering a full-scale application in an agricultural context, a batch test was carried out to evaluate the performance of the system. An increase of 22% in the biomass concentration in 4 d was registered, and all nutrients were consumed during the first two days. In the continuous experiment carried out over winter (December April), productivity was between 2 and 14 g g [TSS] m(-3) d, but values up to 76.4 g [TSS] m(-3) d were reached at the end of the study in spring, despite the low nutrients concentration in the feedstock. Elimination of emerging contaminants was also evaluated, obtaining the highest removals for the synthetic musk fragrances tonalide and galaxolide (73% and 68%), and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (61%).

AB Despite all its advantages and potential, cross-linking enzyme aggregate (CLEA) technology is still not applied at an industrial scale for enzyme insolubilization for bioremediation purposes. In this study, the enzyme polymer engineered structure (EPES) method was used to enhance CLEA stability and reuse. A crude laccase from Trametes hirsuta was successfully insolubilized to form EPES-CLEAs. The polymeric network provided excellent stability (> 90%) to CLEAs after a 24-h incubation in a non-buffered municipal wastewater effluent (WW), and the biocatalysts were recycled using a centrifugation process. While CLEAs activity dropped to 17%, EPES-CLEAs showed a laccase activity retention of 67% after five cycles of 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) oxidation. After 8 h of treatment in WW, the EPES-CLEAs were equally as effective in removing cannabidiol (CBD) as the free-LAC (similar to 37%). This research demonstrates that the EPES method is a promising alternative for CLEA stabilization and reuse in environmental conditions.

AB The characterization of the pharmaceutical wastewater by physicochemical analysis of some parameters showed a significant pollution load, expressed particularly by organic pollutants (chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand). The removal of chemical oxygen demand by adsorption on anthracite is investigated in this study. The adsorption isotherms are realized in batch system; several working parameters, such as mass of adsorbent, contact time, temperature and particle size of anthracite were studied in an attempt to achieve a higher removal efficiency.
   The adsorption treatment achieved a maximum reduction of 70% for chemical oxygen demand under the following experimental conditions: 20 degrees C, 3 g of adsorbent, contact time: 1 hour and particle size of 0.6 mm. The adsorption follows well the Freundlich model and the adsorption kinetics is the pseudo-first-order type. The free energy change of COD adsorption on anthracite was calculated, and it indicates that adsorption is a spontaneous and physical process.

AB In order to analyse genetic relationships between functional strain Xhhh previously constructed through protoplast fusion for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and its parents, random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPID) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to investigate genetic similarities among the strains based on genome and functional genes analyses. A total of 739 clear and consistent bands were produced in the RAPID fingerprint analysis with 40 primers. The genetic similarity indices between Xhhh and parental strains PC (Phanerochaete chrysosporium), SC (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and XZ (native bacterium Bacillus sp.) were 36.21%, 37.73% and 37.48%, respectively. With PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, Xhhh was found containing functional genes of mnp and lip from PC, FLO1 from SC and 165 rDNA fragments from XZ. Experimental results of genetic analyses were in accordance with Xhhh biochemical and phenotypic characteristics, and protoplast fusion technique is considered as a promising technique in environmental pollution control.

AB Inefficient ketoprofen removal from pharmaceutical wastewater may negatively impact the ecosystem and cause detrimental risks to human health. This study was conducted to determine the cytotoxicity effects of ketoprofen on HEK 293 cell growth and metabolism, including cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) expression, at environmentally relevant concentrations. The cytotoxic effects were evaluated through the trypan blue test, DNS assay, MTT assay, and the expression ratio of the COX-1 gene. The results of this study show insignificant (p > 0.05) cytotoxic effects of ketoprofen on cell viability and cell metabolism. However, high glucose consumption rates among the treated cells cause an imitation of the Warburg effect, which is likely linked to the development of cancer cells. Apart from that, the upregulation of COX-1 expression among the treated cells indicates remote possibility of inflammation. Although no significant cytotoxic effects of ketoprofen were detected throughout this study, the effects of prolonged exposure of residual ketoprofen need to be evaluated in the future.

AB The distribution of 14 ARGs, intI1, and 16S rDNA were analysed in 4 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 2 effluent receiving areas (ERAs), and Hangzhou Bay (HZB). The results showed that each integrated WWTP (IWWTP) received higher abundance of ARGs than pharmaceutical WWTPs (PWWTPs), and IWWTPs removed ARGs more efficiently than PWWTPs. The WWTP effluents greatly contributed to the ARGs pollution in the water environments of the ERAs and HZB, and the total abundance of the ARGs displayed a distance decay pattern. In coastal sediments, more ARGs were accumulated in remote sites. The correlation analysis showed that the occurrence of ARGs was more related to 16S rDNA and intI1 in the WWTPs. Three macrolides resistance genes (ermB, mphA, and vatB) had strong correlations with 16S rDNA and intI1 in all the sample groups. Our study clearly reveals the link between land WWTPs discharge and emerging pollution of ARGs in coastal environments.

AB Photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline using MWCNT/TiO(2)nanocomposite was investigated under UVC irradiation. The effective operational parameters included pH, irradiation time, photocatalyst dosage, weight ratio of MWCNT to TiO2 and tetracycline concentration and were studied consecutively. Complete removal of tetracycline concentrations of up to 10 mg/L was obtained at MWCNT to TiO2 ratio of 1.5 (w/w%), pH 5, photocatalyst dosage of 0.2 g/L. Pseudo-first order kinetic model was best fitted with the experimental results (R-2: 0.91-0.98 for different tetracycline concentrations). Based on TOC analysis, mineralization was 37% in the same reaction conditions for initial tetracycline concentration of 10 mg/L and reached to 83% after 300 min. In the case of real pharmaceutical wastewater, the COD concentration of 2267 mg/L decreased to 342 mg/L after 240 min in the same operational conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fenamates are a class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are not fully removed during wastewater treatment and can be released to surface waters. Here, near-surface photochemical half-lives were evaluated to range from minutes to hours of four fenamates and the closely related diclofenac. While quantum yields for direct photochemical reactions at the water surface vary widely from 0.071 for diclofenac to < 0.001 for mefenamic acid, all fenamates showed significant reactivity towards singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical with bimolecular reaction rate constants of 1.3-2.8 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) and 1.1-2.7 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Photodecay rates increased in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) for diclofenac (+ 19%), tolfenamic acid (+ 9%), and mefenamic acid (+ 95%), but decreased for flufenamic acid (- 2%) and meclofenamic acid (- 14%) after accounting for light screening effects. Fast reaction rate constants of all NSAIDs with model triplet sensitizers were quantified by laser flash photolysis. Here, the direct observation of diphenylamine radical intermediates by transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates one-electron oxidation of all fenamates. Quenching rate constants of these radical intermediates by ascorbic acid, a model antioxidant, were also quantified. These observations suggest that the balance of oxidation by photoexcited triplet DOM and quenching of the formed radical intermediates by antioxidant moieties determines whether net sensitization or net quenching by DOM occurs in the photochemical degradation of fenamates.

AB The occurrence and transport of 12 antibiotics (from the tetracycline, sulfonamide, quinolone, and macrolide families) was studied in a 72-km stretch of the Haihe River, China, and in six of its tributaries. Aqueous and sediment samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. Sulfonamides were detected at the highest concentrations (24-385 ng/L) and highest frequencies (76-100%). Eight of the 12 antibiotics likely originated from veterinary applications in swine farms and fishponds, and concentrations at these sources (0.12-47 mu g/L) were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than in the effluent of local wastewater treatment plants. Sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) was detected in all swine farm and fishpond samples (maximum concentration 47 mu g/L), which suggests its potential usefulness to indicate livestock source pollution in the Haihe River basin. Hydrological and chemical factors that may influence antibiotic distribution in the Haihe River were considered by multiple regression analysis. River flow rate exerted the most significant effect on the first-order attenuation coefficient (K) for sulfonamides, quinolones, and macrolides, with higher flow rates resulting in higher K, probably due to dilution. For tetracyclines, sediment total organic matter and cation exchange capacity exerted a greater impact on K than flow rate, indicating that adsorption to sediments plays an important role in attenuating tetracycline migration. Overall, the predominance of sulfonamides in the Haihe River underscores the need to consider regulating their veterinary use and improving the management and treatment of associated releases.

AB Air-liquid exchange process could spread pathogens and pharmaceutical emerging pollutants into the air as aerosol particles in an Urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs). These particles can later be transported to places where such pollution is unforeseen. In this study, measurements were conducted in the aeration area of a UWTP in northern Taiwan. According to this investigation, nanoparticles are major contributors to both the number and volume concentration of particles. Most fluorescent particles may be bacterial aggregates or fungal species. Moreover, nine common emerging contaminants were analyzed and found in both air and water samples. Among these contaminants, the most abundant chemicals in the air were erythromycin-H2O (191.45 pg/m(3)) and methamphetamine (39.02 pg/m(3)). These results imply that UWTPs could be an emission source of emerging contaminants and bioaerosols, and the potential risk of inhalation exposure should be carefully evaluated.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) is one of the largest sources of pharmaceutical release. The present paper proposes the sustainable and controllable hospital wastewater treatment method based on the photo-Fenton process using MnO2 and moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) treatment followed by ozonation process. The method has satisfactory removal rates of Ibuprofen and Ofloxacin>90%. Evaluation of the optimum operational parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), ozone consumption (OC), time of ozone exposure (TOE), manganese oxide (MnO2) concentration (MOC) was carried out. It was established that the optimal performance occurred at following conditions - HRT (16-20 hours), MLSS (2500-3500 mg/L), OC (7-9 L/hrs), TOE (4-10 min) and MOC (1.9-2.7 mg/L). It is proposed for practical application to control the HWW in two stages. The first stage includes preliminary tests for evaluation of optimum MOC. The second stage is based on continuous evaluation of HRT and TOE using analytical modelling functions.

AB In this study, the effects of organic loading rate (OLR) and the addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on the performance and membrane fouling of MBR were conducted to treat real pharmaceutical process wastewater. Over 145 days of operation, the MBR system was operated at OLRs ranging from 1 to 2 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) without sludge wasting. The addition of PAC provided an improvement in the flux, despite an increase in the OLR:PAC ratio. The results demonstrated that the hybrid PAC-MBR system maintained a reduced amount of membrane fouling and steadily increased the removal performance of etodolac. PAC addition reduced the deposition of extracellular polymeric substance and organic matter on the membrane surface and resulted an increase in COD removal even at higher OLRs with low PAC addition. Membrane fouling mechanisms were investigated using combined adsorption fouling models. Modified fouling index values and normalized mass transfer coefficient values indicated that predominant fouling mechanism was cake adsorption.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the fate of the antimicrobial agent triclosan (TCS) in a conventional septic tank. The main mechanism of TCS removal from wastewater was identified to be rapid TCS sorption to suspended particles followed by settling of these particles to the bottom of the septic tank. Sorption to particles was completed within minutes while the settling took several days. Therefore, in a septic tank the removal of TCS from wastewater is mainly determined by the removal of suspended particles by sedimentation. Over 5 days of hydraulic residence time the initial dissolved TCS concentration of 100 mu g L-1 was reduced by 87 +/- 8%. During the first 24 hours, 66-86% of all removed TCS was retained, whereas during the remainder of the experiment a slight but steady decrease in TCS concentration was observed. This was most likely caused by TCS diffusion and its subsequent sorption onto the septic sludge.

AB Caffeine is one of the most consumed substances, and it has been largely detected in aquatic ecosystems. We investigated the trends in caffeine consumption over three decades and its relationships with gross domestic product (GDP) and human development index (HDI) to understand global patterns and to identify potential hotspots of contamination. The total caffeine consumption is increasing mainly due to population growth. Moreover, caffeine consumption per capita is also increasing in some countries, such as Brazil, Italy, and Ethiopia. A high positive correlation between caffeine consumption per capita with HDI and GDP was found for coffee-importing countries in Europe, while a high negative correlation was found for coffee-exporting countries in Africa. The literature review showed that the highest caffeine concentrations coincide with countries that present an increasing caffeine consumption per capita. Also, approximately 35% of the caffeine concentrations reported in the literature were above the predicted no-effect concentration in the environment and, again, overlaps with countries with increasing per capita consumption. Despite the high degradation rate, caffeine consumption tends to increase in a near future, which may also increase the overall amount of caffeine that comes into the environment, possibly exceeding the thresholds of several species described as tolerant to the current environmental concentrations. Therefore, it is essential to prevent caffeine from reaching aquatic ecosystems, implementing sewage treatment systems, and improving their efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous release of personal care products in environmental systems provokes adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems, as result of compound-specific biological interactions and chemical activity. Such substances are classified as organic compounds and are frequently found on consumer goods used by people in everyday activities. This study investigates the presence and risks of four parabens and triclosan on tributaries of the Iguassu River, located in the south region of Brazil. Important reservoirs used for potable water consumption are in the Upper Iguassu basin. Monitoring efforts were conducted in three rivers in the form of five campaigns along 10 control sections. Compound concentrations were determined by solid phase extraction and gas chromatography hyphenated to a mass spectrometer. Estimation of environmental risk for each compound was performed employing risk indexes, considering detected concentrations for the sections, lethal and effective median concentrations (LC and EC50) for various trophic levels reported in the literature. Concentration values show clear anthropic influence, presumably from raw domestic sewage discharges or effluents from wastewater treatment plants. Annual subtropical seasonality and low rainfall rates during winter can influence and increase the detected concentrations, also influencing the hazard quotient (HQ). The environmental risk assessment reveals that HQ tends to increase along the river course. As for the sensitivity of different trophic levels, parabens tend to affect particular trophic groups, while triclosan affects all four trophic groups.

AB Source point treatment of effluents with a high load of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), such as hospital wastewater, is a matter of discussion among the scientific community. Fungal treatments have been reported to be successful in degrading this type of pollutants and, therefore, the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor was applied for the removal of PhACs from veterinary hospital wastewater. Sixty-six percent removal was achieved in a non-sterile batch bioreactor inoculated with T. versicolor pellets. On the other hand, the study of microbial communities by means of DGGE and phylogenetic analyses led us to identify some microbial interactions and helped us moving to a continuous process. PhAC removal efficiency achieved in the fungal treatment operated in non-sterile continuous mode was 44 % after adjusting the C/N ratio with respect to the previously calculated one for sterile treatments. Fungal and bacterial communities in the continuous bioreactors were monitored as well.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a topic of concern. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a wide-spread antiepileptic drug and due to its physical-chemical characteristics minimal removal is achieved in conventional water treatments, and thus has been suggested as a molecular marker of wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater. The present study reports the biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain Labrys portucalensis F11. When supplied as a sole carbon source, a 95.4% biotransformation of 42.69 mu M CBZ was achieved in 30 days. In co-metabolism with acetate, complete biotransformation was attained at a faster rate. Following a target approach, the detection and identification of 14 intermediary metabolites was achieved through UPLC-QIDF/MS/MS. Biotransformation of CBZ by the bacterial strain is mostly based on oxidation, loss of -CHNO group and ketone formation reactions: a biotransformation pathway with two routes is proposed. The toxicity of untreated and treated CBZ solutions was assessed using Vibrio Fischeri and Lepidium sativum acute toxicity tests and Toxi-Chromo Test. The presence of CBZ and/or its degradations products in solution resulted in moderate toxic effect on Vibrio Fischen, whereas the other organisms were not affected. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report that proposes the metabolic degradation pathway of CBZ by a single bacterial strain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tertiary treatment of wastewater with ozone is a promising technique for removing residual micropollutants that remain after secondary biological treatment. We monitored the performance of a full-scale ozonation reactor on a sewage treatment plant in Switzerland with a screening battery of bioassays. Six toxicity endpoints were selected that covered non-specific toxicity, as well as selected receptor-mediated modes of action and reactive toxicity. Non-specific toxicity was assessed with two bioassays, the bioluminescence inhibition of the marine luminescent bacterium Vibrio Fischeri and the growth inhibition of the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Treatment efficiency was around 90% for the secondary treatment, but only 65% and 76% for the ozonation step in the two nonspecific endpoints, respectively. This finding is consistent with this type of oxidation reaction because ozone only modifies the organic molecules but does not mineralize them fully leaving residual toxicity of the transformation products. In contrast, the specific receptor-mediated endpoints of inhibition of photosystem II in algae and estrogenicity were largely reduced by ozonation. While compounds inhibiting photosynthesis proved to be rather recalcitrant toward biological treatment with only 47% removal, an additional 86% removal by ozonation yielded an overall treatment efficiency in the entire treatment chain of 89%. The effect on estrogenicity, quantified with the yeast estrogen screen, was even more significant: A treatment efficiency of 95% in the secondary treatment, 86% during ozonation plus a small effect by biological sand filtration yielded an overall treatment efficiency of 99.5%. Insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase were fairly resistant to degradation, but an overall treatment efficiency of 91% was achieved in two steps: 72% in biological treatment and 60% during ozonation. Finally, no significant genotoxicity was observed with the umuC test after ozonation, while the influent showed a genotoxic response when it was enriched by a factor of 15 to 60. Treatment efficiency increased with the ozone dose and remained virtually unchanged over ozone doses above 500 g ozone per kg dissolved organic carbon. The reduction of toxicity can be rationalized by the chemical oxidation processes likely to occur for each group of chemicals that are typical for a given mode of toxic action. For comparison, tertiary treatment with powdered activated carbon was also evaluated, which poses a viable alternative to ozonation with respect to removal of micropollutants.

AB Metoprolol is a beta-blocker highly prescribed for the treatment of heart diseases. It is not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants and it has been detected not only in the treated effluents, but also in natural waters. Thus, the knowledge of its fate in the environment is an important issue, and photodegradation is an important degradation pathway. While direct photodegradation of metoprolol by solar light is not relevant, there is evidence in the literature that it suffers indirect photodegradation and a few studies have been published showing the important role of dissolved humic matter as photo sensitizer. However, the identification of the photoproducts formed in the presence of humic matter is very poor, since only 2 photoproducts had been identified. This study investigated the degradation of metoprolol under simulated solar radiation and in the presence of fulvic acids (FA) extracted from a river. During the photodegradation experiments we observed the formation of new compounds which were separated and tentatively identified by HPLC-UV-ESI-MSn. At least 16 compounds were tentatively identified,including the 2 compounds previously identified in the literature and 4 new compounds which had not been detected by other authors as degradation products of metoprolol, even when submitted to artificial degradation processes.

AB Pharmaceutical products are often present in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers and lakes. A wide variety of drugs have been found in waterways of many countries, including analgesics, antibiotics and antiepileptics. The adsorption of four common pharmaceuticals present in surface-waters, trimethoprim (antibiotic), carbamazepine (antiepileptic), ketoprofen and naproxen (analgesics) onto Amberlite XAD-7 (an acrylic ester resin) has been investigated. Adsorption experiments were carried out at different pH conditions and the experimental equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. For the same experimental conditions (pH 7) the estimated adsorption capacities are from 97 mg g(-1) for carbamazepine >54 mg g(-1) for trimethoprim >45 mg g(-1) for ketoprofen and approximate to 43 mg g(-1) for naproxen. The influence of adsorption pH was established for each compound. The investigation indicates that the mean sorption energy (E=8.3-10.1 kJ mol(-1)) characterizes a physical adsorption and the surface of the resin is energetically heterogeneous. On the other hand, the work studies the effect of the presence of other drugs in solution on the individual adsorption process. The comparison of Freundlich-parameters shows that the adsorption capacity decreases as expected for neutral and acidic drugs and increases for the case of trimethoprim (a basic drug).

AB Nowadays, antibiotics have been found in the effluents of many pharmaceutical industries and hospitals, sanitary sewage, surface water and groundwater. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of using Hexadecyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide modified montmorillonite (HDTMA-Mt) as an inexpensive and suitable adsorbent for the removal of Penicillin G from aqueous solutions. The experiments were conducted in a batch system. The effects of different variables including surfactant loading onto the clay, solution pH, contact time, adsorbate concentration and temperature were investigated on the removal of Penicillin G. Surface properties of the clay were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. Various isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) and kinetics (pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models) of adsorption were studied for the data evaluation. The findings indicated that the sorption capacity of the modified clay was found to be 88.5 mg/g over 60 min contact time at pH 9. The pseudo-second kinetic (R-2 = 0.999) and Freundlich isotherm (R-2 = 0.915) models best fitted the experimental data of Penicillin G by the adsorbent. The negative values of Delta G at higher temperature and positive value of Delta H showed the endothermic and spontaneously sorption of the drug by the clay. It can be concluded that the modified clay can be considered as a cheap and eco-friendly sorbent for the removal of Penicillin G from water and wastewater. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The quality of environmental waters such as rivers is often deteriorated by various kinds of trace and unidentified chemicals despite the recent development of sewage systems and wastewater treatment technologies. In addition to contamination by particular toxicants, complex toxicity due to multi-component chemicals could be much more serious. The environmental situation in bodies of water in Japan led us to apply bioassays for monitoring the water quality of environmental waters in order to express the direct and potential toxicity to human beings and ecosystems rather than determinating concentrations of particular chemicals. However, problems arose from the fact that bioassays for pharmaceutical purposes generally required complicated, time-consuming, expert procedures. Also, a methodology for feedback of the resultant toxicity data to water environment management has not been established yet. To this end, we developed a novel bioassay based on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake activity of human hepatoblastoma cells. The assay enabled us to directly detect the toxicity of environmental waters within 4 hours of exposure. This is a significantly quick and easy procedure as compared to that of conventional bioassays. The toxicity data for 255 selected chemicals and environmental waters obtained by this method were organized by a mathematical equation in order to make those data much more effectively and practically useful to the management of environmental waters. Our methodology represents a promising example of applying bioassays to monitor environmental water quality and generating potential solutions to the toxicity problems encountered.

AB Pollution of water sources by pharmaceuticals has attracted attention. In this work, carbamazepine (CBZ), as a model pharmaceutical pollutant, was used to investigate its characteristics of adsorption from an aqueous solution. Flax shives and oat hulls, representing cellulosic materials of agricultural by-products, were characterized and used to develop hydrochars and steam activated hydrochars adsorbents. Hydrothermal treatment and steam activation significantly enhanced the CBZ adsorption capacity. The isotherms of CBZ adsorption by the steam activated hydrochars were experimentally investigated at various temperatures (20-40 degrees C) and satisfactorily simulated by the Sips model. The steam activated hydrochars of flax shives and oat hulls had higher maximum CBZ adsorption capacities of 293.5 and 162.6 mg/g than the respective hydrochars (75.3 and 81.8 mg/g) and raw materials (16.5 and 15.0 mg/g). Based on the isotherm modeling results, the site energy distribution of CBZ adsorption was further determined. The weighted means of site energy obtained at 40 degrees C (13.3-15.0 kJ/mol) were higher than those at 30 degrees C (11.2-13.4 kJ/mol) and 20 degrees C (7.7-8.0 kJ/mol), indicating higher adsorption affinity, thus more favorable adsorption. Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters of CBZ adsorption were determined. The results indicated that the CBZ adsorption on hydrochars and steam activated hydrochars were endothermic and spontaneous.

AB Nowadays, monitoring focuses on the primary compounds and does not include degradation products formed during various biological and chemical processes. Transformation products may have the same effects to human health and the environment or sometimes they can be more toxic than the parent compound. Unfortunately, knowledge about the formation of degradation products is still limited, however, can be very important for the environmental risk assessment. Firstly, the photodegradation kinetic of amlodipine was investigated in two experimental conditions: during the exposure to solar radiation and during the exposure to the light emitted by the xenon lamp. In all cases degradation of amlodipine followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. In the next step, identification of transformation products of amlodipine formed during the exposure to xenon lamp irradiation was performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). As a result sixteen photoproducts were identified, their structures were elucidated and ultimately the transformation pathway was proposed. Fifteen compounds (out of 16 photoproducts) were newly identified and reported here for the first time; some of those compounds were formed from the first photoproduct, amlodipine pyridine derivative. Several analytes were formed only in acidic or basic conditions. Furthermore, the occurrence of amlodipine and its identified degradation products was investigated in environmental waters. Only one out of 16 compounds was found in wastewater effluent. The possibility of the sorption of examined analytes to sewage sludge particles was discussed based on QSAR.

AB Chemicals released into freshwater systems threaten ecological functioning and may put aquatic life and the health of humans at risk. We developed a new contaminant fate model (CFM) that follows simple, well-established methodologies and is unique in its cross-border, seamless hydrological and geospatial framework, including lake routing, a critical component in northern environments. We validated the model using the pharmaceutical Carbamazepine and predicted eco-toxicological risk for 15 pharmaceuticals in the Saint-Lawrence River Basin, Canada. The results indicated negligible to low environmental risk for the majority of tested chemicals, while two pharmaceuticals showed elevated risk in up to 13% of rivers affected by municipal effluents. As an integrated model, our CFM is designed for application at very large scales with the primary goal of detecting high risk zones. In regulatory frameworks, it can help screen existing or new chemicals entering the market regarding their potential impact on human and environmental health. Due to its high geospatial resolution, our CFM can also facilitate the prioritization of actions, such as identifying regions where reducing contamination sources or upgrading treatment plants is most pertinent to achieve targeted pollutant removal or to protect drinking water resources.

AB Although various single-concentration measurements of the pharmaceutical diclofenac are available in literature, detailed information on the mass flux in the aquatic environment is often missing. Therefore, the overall load of diclofenac was obtained by recording each concentration in nine effluents of sewage treatment plants (STP) and at three river sites located in the area of the river Main (Germany) over a time period of six weeks.
   In STP effluents, concentrations of up to 2200 ng/L were obtained. In combination with flow rates and connected population an average specific load per capita and day of 0.28 mg (+/-0.11 mg) diclofenac reaches the receiving water course. This average specific load per capita is an expressive parameter to assess main diclofenac exposure to the aquatic environment avoiding uncertainties of estimated data commonly used in exposure assessment. Accordingly, predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) of 140 ng/L for a realistic worst case scenario and 2 to 52 ng/L based on water quality modeling were derived. Since concentrations of up to 140 ng/L were observed in surface water, the obtained PEC is in perfect agreement with measured concentrations. Hence, comparing the PEC with published predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC), chronic adverse effects in fish populations may occur. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Response surface methodology was utilized to optimize the treatment of wastewater from a production of cephem pharmaceuticals using ultrasound/Fenton processes. Box-Behnken design with four variables (initial pH (3, 4 ,5), Fe2+ concentration (0.006, 0.008, 0.010mol/L), mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+ (1:1, 2:1, 3:1), and ultrasound power (400, 450, 500W)) was employed in this study to determine the most efficient combination of these variables for COD removal. The optimum conditions of initial pH, Fe2+ concentration, mole ratio of H2O2 to Fe2+, and ultrasound power were found to be 4.04, 0.008mol/L, 2:1, and 487W, respectively, for maximum COD removal efficiency (87.9%). A quadratic model was obtained for COD removal efficiency through this design. The experimental values are in good agreement with predicted values and the model was highly significant with the correlation coefficient of 0.999.

AB Endophytic fungi inhabit plant tissues asymptomatically and confer a high diversity. They are polyphyletic in nature and primarily belong to the division Ascomycota. Endophytes are an important component of sustainable development in community ecology as they support the rich biodiversity and bioremediation of organic pollutants, wastewater, poisonous gases, industrial sewage, and heavy metals or in agricultural sufficiency. Endophytes are known to produce different kinds of secondary metabolites, and many of them are similar to what the host plants produce. Around 80% of the world's population, mostly those in the developing countries, still rely on herbal medicines for their primary healthcare. Usage of plant sources for commercial production of bioactive compounds requires sacrifice of several trees to obtain satisfactory amounts. This is more so if they were to be isolated from endemic and endangered plant species. Such an aspect poses a grave threat to biodiversity conservation and forces us to go for a judicious usage of plant resources. Hence, production of bioactive compounds by the microorganisms that are intrinsic to the host plant tissues gives us hope. This is because microbial fermentation is comparably cheaper and economically stable and offers a sustainable source to pharmaceutical industries. In this chapter current perspectives of endophytic fungi in sustainable usage such as bioactive compounds of therapeutic use, biotransformations, plant defense and protection mechanisms, biocontrol, and crop production and in sustainable development including nutrient recycling and ecosystem functioning are reviewed and discussed.

AB In this study, six human pharmaceuticals in wastewater, sediments, and solid waste samples of five hospitals in Gujrat, Pakistan, were detected by a validated high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method and then their ecological risk assessment was conducted. The pharmaceuticals include paracetamol, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin and were chromatographed on a C-18 column at 254nm using liquid-liquid extraction. The highest concentration obtained was of paracetamol and it was also detected in all the five hospitals and all the sample matrices (max. 696 ng/mL) whereas, the concentration of other pharmaceuticals were also very high although they were not detected in all the sample matrices. Maximum concentrations of other pharmaceuticals detected were naproxen (220 ng/mL), diclofenac (186 ng/mL), ibuprofen (596 ng/mL), amlodipine (303 ng/mL), and rosuvastatin (104 ng/mL). Risk assessment in terms of risk quotient (RQ) was also calculated based on maximum measured concentration and the RQ values were very high for all pharmaceuticals. The maximum RQ values obtained from different pharmaceuticals were paracetamol (696 against daphnia), naproxen (84 against fish), diclofenac (9300 against Oncorhynchus mykiss), ibuprofen (16 000 against Oryzias latipes), and amlodipine (471 against green algae). The results from this study demand for comprehensive monitoring of pharmaceuticals from different points sources and treatment of all type of wastes including hospital waste.

AB The removal of five selected pharmaceuticals, viz., carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen was examined by batch sorption experiments onto a synthesized mesoporous silica SBA-15. SBA-15 was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement, and point of zero charge (PZC) measurement. Pharmaceutical adsorption kinetics was rapid and occurred on a scale of minutes, following a pseudo-second-order rate expression. Adsorption isotherms were best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. High removal rates of individual pharmaceuticals were achieved in acidic media (pH 3-5) and reached 85.2% for carbamazepine, 88.3% for diclofenac, 93.0% for ibuprofen, 94.3% for ketoprofen, and 49.0% for clofibric acid at pH 3 but decreased with increase in pH. SBA-15 also showed high efficiency for removal of a mixture of 5 pharmaceuticals. Except for cloflbric acid (35.6%), the removal of pharmaceuticals in the mixture ranged from 75.2 to 89.3%. Based on adsorption and desorption results, the mechanism of the selected pharmaceuticals was found to be a hydrophilic interaction, providing valuable information for further studies to design materials for the purpose. The results of this study suggest that mesoporous-silica-based materials are promising adsorbents for removing pharmaceuticals from not only surface water but also wastewater of pharmaceutical industrial manufactures.

AB The occurrence of eight pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs), two metabolites and caffeine was investigated in River Acheloos, located in Western Greece, during a twelve-month monitoring period (March 2007-February 2008). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for the extraction and pre-concentration of the target pollutants and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the detection and quantification. Recoveries were determined between 74.0-100.4% for distilled water and 72.6-95.1% for the river water, whereas the relative standard deviation was less than 9.4% for distilled water and 8% for the river water, respectively. The limits of detection ranged between 1-40ngL(-1). Two pharmaceuticals (paracetamol and carbamazepine), caffeine and the metabolite (salicylic acid), have been detected in all the analysed samples. Maximum concentration levels determined in river samples reached 305ngL(-1) recorded for paracetamol. The concentrations of target compounds were significantly higher in the samples collected at the sampling station situated after the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Agrinio City compared to the samples collected in upper and lower parts of the river. Seasonal variations were attributed mainly to river flow variations and removal percentages by WWTP. Risk quotient method for median environmental concentrations revealed minimal to median risk with the exception of triclosan, ibuprofen and diclofenac, which presented high risk when maximum environmental concentrations were used.

AB In the present investigation, an attempt was made to treat the pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by Iron impregnated poly acrylamide (IPA) compound in a fluidized bed reactor as heterogeneous catalyst. The IPA was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, TGA, DSC, fluorescence spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The experiments were carried out under batch and continuous mode operations. The quantitative removal of COD, BOD5, NH4+-N and TKN from the PWW was evaluated. The oxidation of organics in PWW was confirmed through UV-visible, fluorescence and FT-IR spectroscopy. In this study, the mechanism of oxidation of the persistent organic pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater in terms of the generation of (OH)-O-center dot radical using IPA was evaluated. The (OH)-O-center dot radical was identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) spin trapping method.

AB Aspergillus niger broth culture on wheat bran was assessed for olive wastewater (OW) hydrolysis in order to release hydroxytyrosol (HT). The enzyme profiles of this culture broth gave essentially (1U/L): 3000 beta-glucosidase and 100 esterase. Hydrolysis activity of A. niger enzyme preparation was evaluated by using three substrates: raw OW, phenolic fraction extracted from OW by ethyl acetate and its corresponding exhausted fraction. Large amounts of free simple phenolics were released from exhausted fraction and raw OW after enzymatic treatment. HPLC analyses show that HT was the main phenolic compound. One step of ethyl acetate extraction of hydrolysed OW allowed the recovery of 0.8 g of HT per litre of OW. The antioxidant activity of extracts from OW and exhausted fraction, measured by DPPH method, was drastically enhanced after hydrolysis treatment. This study demonstrates that hydrolysed OW is a potential source of bioactive phenolic compounds with promising applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fish are good indicators of aquatic environment pollution because of their capability to uptake pollutants contained in water. Therefore, accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in freshwater and marine fish and other aquatic organisms has been studied extensively in the last decade. In this context, the present study investigates the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in wild fish from 25 polluted river sites in the USA, downstream from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Sample sites constitute a subset of urban rivers investigated in the U.S. EPA's 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Thirteen pharmaceuticals (out of the twenty compounds analyzed) were quantified in fish fillets at concentrations commonly below 10 ng g(-1), in accordance with the findings from previous studies in the USA and Europe. The psychoactive drugs venlafaxine, carbamazepine and its metabolite 2-hydroxy carbamazepine were the most prevalent compounds (58%, 27% and 42%, respectively). This group of drugs is highly prescribed and rather resistant to degradation during conventional treatment in WWTPs as well as in natural aquatic environments. Salbutamol, a drug used to treat asthma, and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide were also frequently detected (in > 20% of the samples). Occurrence of six pharmaceutical families due to chronic exposure at environmental concentrations in water was detected in eight fish species. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A scoping study was conducted to investigate the residues of nineteen pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including 4 natural and 3 synthetic steroid estrogens, 7 endocrine-disrupting phenols, and 5 acid pharmaceuticals in three urban streams and the Major Pearl River at Guangzhou, a megapolis in the Pearl River Delta, South China. Estrone was detected in >60% water samples with a maximum concentration of 65 ng L-1. Endocrine-disrupting phenols (nonylphenol, bisphenol A, triclosan, 2-phenylphenol, methyparaben, and propylparaben) were found to be widely present at rather high concentrations in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou. Salicylic acid, clofibric acid and ibuprofen were detected in most water samples with maximum concentrations of 2098, 248 and 1417 ng L-1 respectively, whereas naproxen was less frequently detected and also at lower concentration. Both the detection frequencies and median concentrations of the PPCPs appeared higher during the low-flow season than during the high-flow season. The seasonal difference in PPCPs occurrence was probably attributed to the dilution effect caused by the rainfall. PPCPs in the urban riverine water of Guangzhou originated mainly from random discharge and/or leakage of municipal wastewater. PPCPs contamination in the Major Pearl River may be of a potential environmental issue, especially during the low-flow season. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) with activated sludge was operated with synthetic wastewater containing ibuprofen (IBU) to investigate the biomass stress-responses under long-term IBU exposure. There were 3 different phases: phase I as the control without IBU for 56 days, phase II (40 days), and phase III (60 days) containing IBU at 10 and 5 mg L-1 each. The overall performance of the SBR as well as the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in terms of polysaccharides, proteins, and humic acid substances were estimated. Morphological parameters of microbial aggregates in the presence of IBU (phase II and phase III) were assessed by quantitative image analysis (QIA). Removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium (NH4+) were significantly reduced by IBU. Loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) decreased during phase II and phase III, and tightly bound EPS (TBEPS) was slightly higher in phase II than phase I. TB-EPS proteins were greater in phase II, perhaps to protect microbial cells from IBU exposure. These findings provided insight into both activated sludge stress-responses and EPS composition under long-term IBU exposure. Spearman correlation showed that EPS and morphological parameters significantly affected sludge settleability and flocculation. QIA also proved to be a powerful technique in investigating dysfunctions in activated sludge under IBU exposure.

AB There is increasing concern about phenolic environmental estrogens (PEEs) in river systems, especially in economically developed regions, because of their potential to impact ecological systems. We studied the distribution of, ecological risks from, and factors that influenced PEEs in the sediments from the Duliujian River in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration and the Pearl River in Guangdong Province in China. The three target PEEs, nonyl phenol (4-NP), octyl phenol (4-t-OP), and bisphenol A (BPA), were detected in the sediments at concentrations ranging from 204.4 to 12604.3, 32.6 to 297.3, and from 12.8 to 298.4 ng g(-1) in the Pearl River, and from 153.5 to 3614.9, 90.7 to 990.0, and 83.5 -913.3 ng g(-1) in the Duliujian River, respectively. The PEE concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with total organic carbon in the river sediments (p <0.1). Urbanization influenced the distribution of PEEs and applications and discharges of PEEs were associated with large populations and industries. Rainfall and wastewater discharge patterns also influenced how PEEs were distributed in river sediments. The potential ecological risks from 4-NP, 4-t-OP, and BPA in these two rivers were high. Measures should be put in place to control the transport and storage of these compounds in river systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The persistence of certain organic-micropollutants (OMP) in conventional wastewater and reclamation treatments represents a growing concern due to its associated uncertain effects on human health and the environment. This issue highlights the need to resort to advanced treatment technologies to ensure the maximum removal of these compounds. A prototype (1.5-2 m(3)/h) based on the combination of powdered activated carbon (PAC) with tight ultrafiltration (UF) membranes was operated in El Baix Llobregat Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) for 18 months. Its performance was compared from a technical and economic point of view with the current full-scale ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis system (UF-RO with 50% blend). The application of a PAC concentration of 20 mg/L and its separation with UF membrane resulted in an average removal up to 81 +/- 13% of the most recalcitrant OMP detected (Carbamazepine (CBZ), Diuron (DIU), Diclofenac (DCF), Erythromycin (ERY) and Sulphametoxazole (SMX)), while in UF-RO (50% blend), the average removal was 55 +/- 11%. PAC-tight UF presented promising advantages for when these post-treatments need to be implemented in inland WRP and where brine management can represent a drawback. Moreover, PAC-tight UF presents 22% higher Operational Expenditures (OPEX) than UF-RO (50% blend), although in terms of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), it appears as the less expensive option.

AB This work presents the elimination of arsenic ions from synthetic produced water via hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM). Results demonstrate that arsenic ions in synthetic wastewater can be successfully treated to meet the wastewater standard as formulated by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Thailand. The discharged limit of arsenic from industrial wastewater must not be greater than 250 ppb. In a single-step operation, arsenic ions are extracted and stripped. Percentages of extraction and stripping proved to be 100% and 98%, respectively. Optimum conditions found proved to be 0.68 M Aliquat 336 dissolved in toluene as the liquid membrane, at pH 12 of feed solution, having a mixture of HCl and thiourea as the synergistic strippant, and flow rates of both feed and strippant solutions of 100 mL/min. A mathematical model, developed to predict the final concentration of arsenic ions in feed and strippant solutions, is seen to fit in well with the experimental results.

AB Sulfonamide antibiotics (SMs), as a class of antibiotics commonly used in swine industries, pose a serious threat to animal and human health. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with and without supplying a new pomelo peel derived biochar to treat swine wastewater containing SMs. Results show that 0.5 g/L biochar addition could increase more than 30% of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) removal in AnMBR. Approximately 95% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed in the AnMBR at an influent organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.27 kg COD/(m(3).d) while an average methane yield was 0.2 L/g CODremoved with slightly change at a small dose 0.5 g/L biochar addition. SMs inhibited the COD removal and methane production and increased membrane fouling. The addition of biochar could reduce the membrane fouling by reducing the concentration of SMP and EPS.

AB The effect of antimicrobial chemical, triclosan (TCS) on protozoa present in aerobic and anaerobic bioreactors for wastewater treatment is reported in this study. Bioreactor sludge ciliated protozoa such as Spirostomum, Cyclidium and Colpoda and flagellated protozoa Mastigella were exposed to TCS at 1 mg/L level in batch cultures. The response of TCS on protozoa was followed by microscopic observation of the sludge at specific time intervals. Among the protozoa in aerobic sludge, Colpoda exhibited strong sensitivity to triclosan and the cells distorted and burst in 20 minutes period. Mastigella and Spirostomum were resistant to triclosan for first two days, but afterwards the mobility was found declined and subsequently mortality increased to 100% in four and five days respectively. Anaerobic sludge ciliate, Cyclidium exhibited morphological distortion and motility decline after 1 hour exposure to triclosan. The sludge flocs were affected and pelagic cell count declined by the presence of triclosan at the tested level.

AB Antibiotic formulation effluent is well known for its important contribution to environmental pollution due to its fluctuating and recalcitrant nature. In the present study, the chemical treatability of penicillin formulation effluent (average filtered CODo = 830 mg/l; average soluble CODo = 615 mg/l; pH(o) = 6.9) bearing the active substances penicillin Amoxicillin Trihydrate (C16H19N3O5S . 3H(2)O) and the P-lactamase inhibitor Potassium Clavulanate (C8H8KNO5) has been investigated. For this purpose, the penicillin formulation effluent was subjected to ozonation (applied ozone dose = 2500 mg/(1 x h)) at varying pH (2.5-12.0) and O-3 + H2O2 (perozonation) at different initial H2O2 concentrations (= 2-40 mM) and pH 10.5. According to the experimental results, the overall Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiency varied between 10 and 56% for ozonation and 30% (no H2O2) and 83% (20 mM H2O2) for the O-3 + H2O2 process. The addition of H2O2 improved the COD removal rates considerably even at the lowest studied H2O2 concentration. An optimum H2O2 concentration of 20 mM existed at which the highest COD removal efficiency and abatement kinetics were obtained. The ozone absorption rate ranged between 53% (ozonation) and 68% (perozonation). An ozone input of 800 mg/l in 20 min was sufficient to achieve the highest BOD5/COD (biodegradability) ratio (=0.45) and BOD5 value (109 mg/l) for the pre-treated penicillin formulation effluent. After the establishment of optimum ozonation and perozonation conditions, mixtures of synthetic domestic wastewater+raw, ozonated and perozonated penicillin formulation effluent were subjected to biological activated sludge treatment at a food-to-microorganisms (F/M) ratio of 0.23 mg COD/(mg MLSS x d), using a consortium of acclimated microorganisms. COD removal efficiencies of the activated sludge process were 71, 81 and 72% for pharmaceutical wastewater containing synthetic domestic wastewater mixed with either raw, ozonated or perozonated formulation effluent, respectively. The ultimate COD value obtained after 24-h biotreatment of the synthetic domestic wastewater+pre-ozonated formulation effluent mixture was around 100 mg/l instead of 180 mg/l which was the final COD obtained for the wastewater mixture containing raw formulation effluent, indicating that pre-ozonation at least partially removed the non-biodegradable COD fraction of the formulation effluent.

AB Antibiotics in wastewater, sewage sludge, manures, and slurries constitute a risk for the environment when spread on soils. This work studies the adsorption and desorption of the antibiotic cefuroxime (CFX) in 23 agricultural and forest soils, using batch-type experiments. Our results show that the adsorption values were between 40.75 and 99.57% in the agricultural soils, while the range was lower (from 74.57 to 93.46%) in forest soils. Among the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Linear models, the Freundlich equation shows the best fit for the adsorption results. In addition, agricultural soils with higher pH are the ones that present the highest adsorption. Further confirmation of the influence of pH on adsorption is given by the fact that Freundlich's K-F parameter and the Linear model K-d parameter shows a positive correlation with pH and with the exchangeable Ca and Mg values, which are known to affect the charges of the soil colloids and the formation of cationic bridges between adsorbents and adsorbate. In addition, Freundlich's n parameter shows a positive and significant correlation with the organic matter content, related to the high adsorption taking place on forest soils despite their pH < 5. Regarding desorption, in most cases, it is lower than 1%, which indicates that CFX is adsorbed in a rather irreversible way onto these soils. Overall, these results can be considered relevant regarding their potential impact on environmental quality and public health.

AB This study describes an investigation on the occurrence of 27 pharmaceutical compounds, belonging to different classes, in the effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving water bodies in the sensitive area of the Po Valley (northern Italy). These canals were monitored upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge points in order to evaluate the effluent impact on the quality of surface waters, commonly used for irrigation. An environmental risk assessment was also conducted by calculating the risk quotient, i.e. the ratio between measured concentration and predicted no effect concentration.
   Collected data show that, although average values of the selected compounds were in general higher in the effluent than in the surface waters, some compounds not detected in the WWTP effluent were detected in the receiving water (upstream as well as downstream), indicating that sources other than treated effluents are present as contaminations during extraction and analysis have to be excluded. The most critical compounds for the environment were found to be the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The study shows that the potential toxicological effects of persistent micropollutants can be mitigated to some extent by a high dilution capacity, i.e. a high average flow rate in the receiving water body with respect to the effluent.

AB Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antimycotic drug used for the treatment of dermatological and gynecological infections; it is incompletely broken down during sewage treatment and could potentially reach agricultural land through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater. In the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated the persistence and dissipation pathways of H-3-clotrimazole during laboratory incubations of agricultural soils. Clotrimazole was removed from a loam (time to dissipate 50% = 68 d), a sandy loam (time to dissipate 50% = 36 d), and a clay loam (time to dissipate 50% = 55 d), with formation of nonextractable residues being the major sink for H-3. Their parent compound had no significant mineralization, as evidenced by the lack of formation of (H2O)-H-3. Up to 15% of the applied radioactivity was recovered in the form of [H-3]-(2-chlorophenyl)diphenyl methanol. The rate of clotrimazole dissipation in the loam soil did not vary with moisture content, but it was slower at a lower temperature (number of days to dissipate 50% = 275.6 d at 4 degrees C). Addition of municipal biosolids to the loam soil did not vary the clotrimazole dissipation rate. In summary, the present study has established that clotrimazole is dissipated in soil, at rates that varied with soil texture and temperature. Clotrimazole dissipation was accompanied by the formation of nonextractable residues and detectable extractable residues of the transformation product (2-chlorophenyl)diphenyl methanol. Environ.

AB The present study aimed to optimize the production of Scenedesmus sp. biomass during the phycoremediation process. The biomass productivity was optimized using face centred central composite design (FCCCD) in response surface methodology (RSM) as a function of two independent variables that included wet market wastewater concentrations (A) with a range of 10% to 75% and aeration rate (B) with a range of 0.02 to 4.0 L/min. The results revealed that the highest biomass productivity (73 mg/L/d) and maximum growth rate (1.19 day(-1)) was achieved with the 64.26% of (A) and 3.08 L/min of (B). The GC-MS composition analysis of the biomass yield extract revealed that the major compounds are hexadecane (25%), glaucine (16.2%), and phytol (8.33%). The presence of these compounds suggests that WMW has the potential to be used as a production medium for Scenedesmus sp. Biomass, which has several applications in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry.

AB Tetracycline (TC), a major pollutant in water, has an adverse effect on ecosystem and human health. Thus, it is urgent to remove but still remains a challenging. In this work, a new adsorbent of MnO2 decorated on sodium hypochlorite treated expanded graphite (MnO2/TEG) was developed by an in situ hydrothermal method, which exhibited a highly removal rate of 99.2% to pharmaceutical wastewater treated by flocculation. The structure and morphology of the adsorbent was studied by detailed physical characterization. Meanwhile, the main influencing factors on the adsorption behavior such as pH value, concentration, temperature of the solution, adsorption time, metal oxide species and MnO2 loading amount were also investigated in detail. It was found that the electrostatic adsorption between Mn4+ in MnO2/TEG and dimethylamino groups in TC molecules played an important role during the adsorption process. These excellent properties proved that the novel composite could be applied to remove TC residues in pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Spirulina platensis was cultivated in a bench-scale airlift photobioreactor using synthetic wastewater (total nitrogen 412 mg L-1, total phosphorous 90 mg L-1, pH 9-10) with varying ammonia/total nitrogen ratios (50-100% ammonia with balance nitrate) and hydraulic residence times (15-25 d). High average biomass density (3500-3800 mg L-1) and productivity (5.1 g m(-2) d(-1)) were achieved when ammonia was maintained at 50% of the total nitrogen. Both high ammonia concentrations and mutual self-shading, which resulted from the high biomass density in the airlift reactor, were found to partially inhibit the growth of S. platensis. The performance of the airlift bioreactor used in this study compared favorably with other published studies. The system has good potential for treatment of high strength wastewater combined with production of algae for biofuels or other products, such as human and animal food, food supplements or pharmaceuticals.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU), as a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP), is frequently prescribed by doctors to relieve pain. It is widely released into environmental water and soil in the form of chiral enantiomers by the urination and defecation of humans or animals and by sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants. This study focused on the alteration of metabolism in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain after exposure to R-(-)-/S-(+)-/racIBU at 5 mu g L-1 for 28 days. A total of 45 potential biomarkers and related pathways, including amino acids and their derivatives, purine and its derivatives, nucleotides and other metabolites, were observed with untargeted metabolomics. To validate the metabolic disorders induced by IBU, 22 amino acids and 3 antioxidant enzymes were selected to be quantitated and determined using targeted metabolomics and enzyme assay. Stereoselective changes were observed in the 45 identified biomarkers from the untargeted metabolomics analysis. The 22 amino acids quantitated in targeted metabolomics and 3 antioxidant enzymes determined in enzyme assay also showed stereoselective changes after R-(-)-/S-(+)-/racIBU exposure. Results showed that even at a low concentration of R-(-)-/S-(+)-/rac-IBU, disorders in metabolism and antioxidant defense systems were still induced with stereoselectivity. Our study may enable a better understanding of the risks of chiral PPCPs in aquatic organisms in the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can impact aquatic organisms. Health indicators were compared for mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) collected above and below WWTP discharges from five streams in suburban areas of the Houston metropolitan area, Texas, USA. Specimens were evaluated for reproductive, morphological, and histological indicators. Several indicators revealed significant spatial and temporal variation; however, possibly because of their mobility, fish collected upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants did not reveal consistent trends based on the endpoints examined. CEC concentrations in water samples from stream reaches below WWTP discharges were quantified for the first time in the Houston Metropolitan area. The 18 CECs detected in stream water had concentrations lower than values currently reported to impact fish. Future research should examine caged fish at each site and fish collected over longer stream reaches that receive successive discharges from WWTP and stronger CEC gradients.

AB Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is an advanced technology in treating pharmaceutical wastewater, but the membrane fouling limits its development. In this study, the biochar with adsorption capacity of biopolymers was added in AnMBR to investigate its potential in treating pharmaceutical wastewater and alleviating membrane fouling. In the biochar-amended AnMBR, adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) was removed effectively, and more COD was biotransformed into CH4. Membrane fouling mitigation was achieved in the third stage with a 56% decrease of average transmembrane pressure difference (TMP) rising rate. The predominant culprit, proteins of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS-proteins) in sludge mixture and cake layer, was reduced significantly. Particularly, the proportion of micromolecular (0.1-0.15 kDa) EPS-proteins in cake layer was 1.5-folds that of the control group. The important bio-foulant genus Arcobacter aggregating on the membrane had less and almost half the relative abundance (16.5%) than that of the control group (30.7%).

AB A laboratory scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used with three different flat sheet (FS) membrane modules treating a high strength real industrial zone wastewater. Both the MBR and the conventional activated sludge (CAS) system treating carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were compared in terms of metals and micropollutants removal. Different types of micropollutants were selected; ibuprofen as a pharmaceutical, triclosan as a personal care product and four other pollutants as industrial ones: bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Ibuprofen and BPA removal results were consistent with the literature which were higher than 99%. PAHs are removed efficiently both in WWTP and the MBR. However, the MBR performed better than WWTP for many PAH types. No PCBs were detected in all analysis. This study showed that while MBR was a good option for PAHs and some phthalates, there is little or no difference between MBR and CAS for the most of the pollutants.

AB Antibiotics-bacteria interactions depend on antibiotic concentration at the scale of bacteria. This study investigates how vancomycin penetrates into activated sludge flocs and can be sorbed on the bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The 3D structure of flocs was imaged using EPS auto fluorescence. The green fluorescent BODIPY (R) FL vancomycin was introduced in a microscopic chamber containing activated sludge and penetration of vancomycin into the flocs by diffusion was observed using time-lapse microscopy. The penetration depended on the floc structure, as long and large pores could go through the whole flocs making preferential path. The antibiotic concentration into the flocs was also found to depend on the sorption rate. BODIPY (R) FL vancomycin was found to bind preferentially into Gram(+) bacteria than on EPS. The vancomycin adsorption constant on bacteria according to the linear adsorption model, Kd(bacteria) was estimated to be 5 times higher (SD 2.6) than the adsorption constant on EPS Kd(EPS). These results suggest that antibiotic removal by sorption into wastewater treatment plants could change according to the amount of bacteria in the sludge. Moreover, antibiotic concentration at the scale of bacteria could be significantly higher than the concentration in the bulk solution and this should be taken into account when studying antibiotic activity or biodegradation.

AB The effects of controlled temperature variation in the range of 10-45 degrees C were assessed in a lab-scale MBR that treated synthetic municipal wastewater spiked with selected micropollutants. The effects were evaluated with respect to total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) removal, micropollutant removal, sludge growth, level of soluble microbial products (SMPs) in the mixed liquor and membrane fouling. Overall, the temperature shifts caused high variation in the TOC and TN levels in the reactor supernatant, however that in membrane-permeate was relatively more stable, substantiating the robustness of the MBR process. Results regarding the removal of micropollutants at ambient temperature (20 degrees C) demonstrate an apparent correlation between hydrophobicity, chemical structures and the removal of micropollutants. Temperature variation below and above 20 degrees C, especially the operation under 45 degrees C appeared to significantly influence the removal of certain less hydrophobic (log D<3.2) micropollutants possessing strong electron withdrawing functional groups. The removal of most hydrophobic compounds (log D > 3.2) was stable under the temperature range of 10-35 degrees C, however, deteriorated at 45 degrees C. The temperature shifts were also associated with higher levels of SMP in the mixed liquor which appeared to trigger membrane fouling as evidenced by a rapid increase in transmembrane pressure.

AB Featured Application Authors are encouraged to provide a concise description of the specific application or a potential application of the work. This section is not mandatory. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in water catchments and drinking waters raises potential risks to public health. Therefore, after addressing the major aquatic contamination pathway, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and, subsequently, surface waters, 18 human pharmaceuticals from 6 therapeutic groups (antibiotics, lipid regulators, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormones) were analyzed in drinking water catchments, tap and drinking fountain waters. This was performed by solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (LC-MS/MS). The 97 samples analyzed were collected from 31 different sites in the center of Portugal. All samples presented concentrations below the method detection limits (MDLs) that ranged between 1.13 to 5.45 ng L-1. The achieved results contributed to a better knowledge on the Portuguese and European context of drinking water, since there is a knowledge gap regarding this matrix. Comparing our data with other studies, published worldwide, we can observe that median concentrations of pharmaceuticals were reported in the low ng L-1 levels, values close to our MDLs. Consequently, it is unlikely that, in light of the current knowledge, the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water presents a threat to human health.

AB Some artificial sweeteners (ASs) are used in pig feeds, although little is known on this regard. An investigation was conducted by determining seven common ASs in pig feed, manure, wastewater, compost, and soil from 16 pig farms in Tianjin, China. Saccharin (SAC) was predominant in feed (1.41-326 mg/kg) and manure samples (1.06-401 mg/kg). The annual mass loads of ASs in pig feeds were estimated at 5.69-119, 4.92-149, and 1.29-35 kg per 10(3) piglets, hogs, and sows, respectively. The annual emission of ASs via biowaste (i.e., manure) was estimated at 3.58-85.2, 0.04-26.2, and 0.08-9.97 kg per 10 3 capita for the three dominant ASs, i.e., SAC, neotame (NEO), and cyclamate (CYC). On a global scale, SAC was also widely detected at concentrations of 0.01-326 mg/kg in pig feed from China, Switzerland, Japan, Chile, and the United States, suggesting the worldwide use of ASs in pig feed. NEO and CYC were found in 41% and 30% of the feed samples, respectively, at concentrations of 0.05-70 mg/kg, whereas other ASs were barely found with rather lower concentrations. The annual mass loads of ASs consumed via pig feed consumption were estimated at 2400 tons worldwide. Thus, pig farming is an important source of ASs to the environment.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a unique group of emerging and nonpersistent contaminants. In this study, 27 PPCPs in various water samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE), and determined by isotope dilution method using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem triple quadruple mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). A total of 27 isotopically labeled standards (ILSs) were applied to correct the concentration of PPCPs in spiked ultrapure water, drinking water, river, effluent and influent sewage. The corrected recoveries were 73%-122% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) < 16%, except for acetaminophen. The matrix effect for all kinds of water samples was < 22% and the method quantitation limits (MQLs) were 0.45-8.6 ng/L. The developed method was successfully applied on environmental water samples. The SPE extracts of spiked ultrapure water, drinking water, river and wastewater effluent were stored for 70 days, and the ILSs-corrected recoveries of 27 PPCPs were obtained to evaluate the correction ability of ILSs in the presence of variety interferences. The recoveries of 27 PPCPs over 70 days were within the scope of 72%-140% with the recovery variation < 37% in all cases. The isotope dilution method seems to be of benefit when the extract has to be stored for long time before the instrument analysis.

AB Complexity, presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and need to meet stringent rules have made treating of pharmaceutical wastewater highly challenging, which lead to an increase in attention towards these wastewaters seeking alternate and new methods. Some of the most commonly and widely accepted such treatment methods are activated carbon, membrane filtration and reverse osmosis. The present study focusses on treating wastewater from pharmaceutical industry using a combination of sequential batch reactor (SBR) and reverse osmosis (RO). After a series of four SBR treatments (SBR -I, II, III and IV) 53.7% of COD reduction was obtained by the end of SBR -IV. 99% removal in TDS, 99% reduction in COD and 83% reduction in Ammonia were obtained after treating the effluent from SBR by reverse osmosis. From the result it is concluded that series of SBR treatment proved to be suitable pretreatment for Reverse Osmosis which has shown promising results in reduction of the tested pollution parameters.

AB Activated carbon is investigated as adsorptive barrier for organic micropollutants (OMP) within the Berlin water cycle. In a pilot plant using granular activated carbon (GAC) as upper layer in dual-media filtration, OMP concentrations in treated wastewater could be reduced without any negative impact on filtration efficiency. OMP breakthroughs occurred after shorter runtimes than estimated according to isotherm experiments with powdered activated carbon (PAC). Batch adsorption tests comparing the used GAC to new GAC showed that the capacity of the used GAC was not exhausted, indicating that besides direct site competition, pore blocking is also responsible for the poor GAC performance. A pilot plant application of PAC of the same type as GAC showed significantly higher OMP removals at lower dosages, taking advantage of immobilization of PAC particles in the filters. Both PAC and GAC applications can be integrated into tertiary wastewater treatment without significant constructional changes.

AB This paper aims to demonstrate that integrating biological process and photocatalytic oxidation in a system operated in recycling mode can be a promising technology to treat pharmaceutical wastewater characterized by simultaneous presence of biodegradable and refractory/inhibitory compounds. A lab-scale system integrating a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a TiO2 slurry photoreactor was fed on simulated wastewater containing 10 mg/L of the refractory drug Carbamazepine (CBZ). Majority of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed by the MBR, while the photocatalytic oxidation was capable to degrade CBZ. CBZ degradation kinetics and its impacts on the biological process were studied. The adoption of a recycling ratio of 4:1 resulted in removal of up to 95% of CBZ. Effluent COD reduction, sludge yield increase and respirometric tests suggested that the oxidation products were mostly biodegradable and not inhibiting the microbial activity. These results evidenced the advantages of the proposed approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater and similar industrial effluents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop a municipal wastewater treatment method based on a solar advanced oxidation process (AOP) permitting reuse of the treated wastewater. The photoactive layer of TiO2 was deposited on glass spheres using the sol-gel dip-coating technique. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Degradation of 15 emerging contaminants (ECs), each with an initial concentration of 100 mu g L-1 was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-UV) and mineralization was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar of Almeria. Five cycles of photocatalysis were studied for photocatalyst durability and activity. It was demonstrated that after five cycles, although photoactivity of the catalyst slowly decreases, it continues degrading contaminants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) and hospitals are major point sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in aquatic environments. This study investigated the removal efficiencies of 23 known or suspected EDCs through the San Marcos WRRF to determine which treatment process was the most effective at removal. Results from samples collected at the hospital indicate that the hospital discharge is contributing to the concentration of these compounds in the San Marcos wastewater collection system (0.05-140 g/L concentrations). The most frequently detected compounds in the WRRF influent included acetaminophen, nonylphenol, caffeine, benzophenone, N, N-diethyl-mtoluamide (DEET), bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan. Comparison of influent and effluent concentrations showed that the San Marcos WRRF is effectively removing (> 92%) of these compounds, with the exception of carbamazepine and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). These preliminary results will be used to guide future improvements within the WRRF.

AB Solutions to global water stress problems are urgently needed yet must be sustainable, economical and safe. The utilisation of alternative water sources like reclaimed municipal wastewater is one of the most obvious and promising options in integrated water resources management. Among the various beneficial uses of reclaimed wastewater Aquifer Recharge (AR) receives growing attention because it features advantages such as additional natural treatment, storage capacity to buffer seasonal variations of supply and demand as well as mixing with natural water bodies which promotes the acceptance of further uses, particularly indirect potable use. Major concerns about the safety of this exploitation route of an alternative water source are connected to microbial and chemical contaminants occurring in wastewater, among which are emerging trace organics like endocrine disrupters and pharmaceuticals. This paper reviews the current international debate about the relevance of emerging contaminants and technical mitigation options in water recycling for indirect potable use.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were compared with conventional activated sludge systems (CAS) for micropollutant degradation, in laboratory-scale spiking experiments with synthetic and real domestic wastewater. The target micropollutants were polar in nature and represented a broad range in biodegradability. The experimental data indicated that MBR treatment could significantly enhance removal of the micropollutants 1,6- and 2,7-naphthalene disulfonate (NDSA) and benzothiazole-2-sulfonate. 1,5-NDSA, EDTA and diclofenac were not removed in either the MBR or the CAS. The other compounds were equally well degraded in both systems. For 1,3-naphthalene disulfonate, the existence of a minimum threshold level for degradation could be demonstrated. Although MBRs could not always make a difference in the overall removal efficiencies achieved, they showed reduced lag phases for degradation and a stronger memory effect, which implies that they may respond quicker to variable influent concentrations. Finally, micropollutant removal also turned out to be less sensitive to system operational variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, the use of magnetic mesoporous silica microbeads (MMSMB) as supports was proposed to produce magnetically-separable cross-linked enzyme aggregates (MCLEAs). The effects of cross linking time, addition of bovine serum albumin as protein feeder, pH, glutaraldehyde concentration, and laccase:MMSMB mass ratio on the immobilization yield and enzyme load were investigated. The best conditions allowed the rapid preparation of MCLEAs with high enzyme load, i.e., 1.53 U laccase/mg MCLEAs. The stability of MCLEAs was improved with regard to low pH, presence of chemical denaturants, and real wastewater matrix, compared to free laccase. In addition, the novel biocatalyst exhibited good operational stability, maintaining up to 70 % of its initial activity after 10 successive batch reactions. Finally, MCLEAs demonstrated its catalytic potential to transform acetaminophen and various non-phenolic pharmaceutical active compounds as mefenamic acid, fenofibrate, and indomethacin from biologically treated wastewater effluent, with similar or even higher efficiency than free laccase.

AB This paper presents an advancing sustainable membrane-based separation process, which is forward osmosis (FO). The review begins with an introduction of the basic principles of the FO process. Then, a comparison to the most currently well-known desalination technology (RO) is presented. Following section summarizes potential applications of FO in the water desalination field, producing either potable water or irrigation water from brackish/saline feeds. Next, two major FO applications in the domain of water reuse are discussed: wastewater and industrial applications. Wastewater applications are such as OSMBR and landfill leachate treatment; and Industrial applications include oil and gas, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage industries. These different FO applications are briefly reviewed and assessed. Although FO has attracted growing attention in many potential applications, it still experiences several considerable limitations, including concentration polarization, membrane fouling, reverse solute diffusion, and need for membrane and draw solution development.

AB The removal efficiency of nine pharmaceutical compounds from primary sludge was evaluated in two different operating conditions: (i) in conventional Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion (MAD) alone and (ii) in a co-treatment process combining Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion and a Thermophilic Aerobic Reactor (MAD-TAR). The pilot scale reactors were fed with primary sludge obtained after decantation of urban wastewater. Concerning the biodegradation of organic matter, thermophilic aeration increased solubilization and hydrolysis yields of digestion, resulting in a further 26% supplementary removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in MAD-TAR process compared to the conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion. The highest removal rate of target micropollutants were observed for caffeine (CAF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) (>89%) with no substantial differences between both processes. Furthermore, MAD-TAR process showed a significant increase of removal efficiency for oxazepam (OXA) (73%), propranolol (PRO) (61%) and of loxacine (OFL) (41%) and a slight increase for diclofenac (DIC) (4%) and 2 hydroxy-ibuprofen (2OH-IBP) (5%). However, ibuprofen (IBP) and carbamazepine (CBZ) were not degraded during both processes. Anaerobic digestion affected the liquid-solid partition of most target compounds. Sorbed fraction of pharmaceutical compounds on the sludge tend to decrease after digestion, this tendency being more pronounced in the case of the MAD-TAR process due to much lower concentration of solids.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has become a matter of concern in the last decade due to potential risks posed to non-target organisms and the potential for unintended human exposure via food chain. This concern has been driven by a high detection frequency for drugs in environmental samples; these substances are produced in large quantities and are used in both veterinary and human medicine, leading to deposition and potential effects in the environment. However, few studies have focused on the presence of pharmaceuticals in rural areas associated with farming activities in comparison to urban areas. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds in surface waters collected from urban and rural areas in northwestern Spain. A monitoring study was conducted with 312 river water samples analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Positive detection of pharmaceuticals was made for 51 % of the samples. Decoquinate, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine and trimethoprim were the drugs most frequently detected, being present in more than 10 % of the samples. The sampling sites located downstream of the discharge points for wastewater treatment plants yielded the highest number of positive samples, 13 % of the positive samples were detected in these sites and 38 % of the samples collected near the collection point of a drinking water treatment plant were positive.

AB In this study, the optimum operating conditions of a lab-scale completely stirred acidogenic reactor treating a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater were determined. Individual effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR) and pH on the degree of acidification were investigated at a mesophilic temperature (35 +/- 1 degrees C), for HRT in the range 8-24 h, OLR up to 14 kg COD/m(3) d and pH in the range of 5.0-6.3. A maximum acidification level of 44% and COD removal efficiency of 13%, were obtained at an OLR of 13 kg COD/m(3) d at pH of 5.5 +/- 0.1 with an HRT of 12 It. Under these conditions, acetic, propionic and n-butyric acids were found to be predominant volatile fatty acids in the acidogenic reactor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Arid agricultural regions often turn to using treated wastewater (reclaimed water) to irrigate food crops. Concerns arise, however, when considering the potential for persistent contaminants of emerging concern to accumulate into plants intended for human consumption. The present study examined the accumulation of a suite of 9 contaminants of emerging concern into 2 representative food crops, lettuce and strawberry, following uptake via the roots and subsequent distribution to other plant tissues. Calculating accumulation metrics (concentration factors) allowed for comparison of the compartmental affinity of each chemical for each plant tissue compartment. The root concentration factor was found to exhibit a positive linear correlation with the pH-adjusted octanol-water partition coefficient (D-OW) for the target contaminants of emerging concern. Coupled with the concentration-dependent accumulation observed in the roots, this result implies that accumulation of these contaminants of emerging concern into plant roots is driven by passive partitioning. Of the contaminants of emerging concern examined, nonionizable contaminants, such as triclocarban, carbamazepine, and organophosphate flame retardants displayed the greatest potential for translocation from the roots to above-ground plant compartments. In particular, the organophosphate flame retardants displayed increasing affinity for shoots and fruits with decreasing size/octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW). Cationic diphenhydramine and anionic sulfamethoxazole, once transported to the shoots of the strawberry plant, demonstrated the greatest potential of the contaminants examined to be then carried to the edible fruit portion.

AB The variation and fate of four endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) composed of 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were investigated along treatment units in a sewage treatment plant (STP), China with anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic activated sludge processes. The mean concentrations were 64.8?ng/L (E2), 115.3?ng/L (4-n-NP), 171.5?ng/L (EE2), and 920.7?ng/L (BPA) in the influents, and 22.8?ng/L (E2), 50.9?ng/L (4-n-NP), 49.9?ng/L (EE2), and 84.3?ng/L (BPA) in the effluents. The biological treatment was more effective in removing NP, BPA and E2 from the aqueous phase than the primary treatment, while the latter could effectively remove EE2. Their possible removal mechanisms during the biological treatment with activated sludge were further explored through spiked batch experiments under three oxygen-supplying conditions (anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic). The batch experiments showed that 4-n-NP, E2 and BPA were removed from the aqueous phase through biodegradation. The combination of sludge sorption and biodegradation accounted for the removal of EE2. Anoxic activated sludge showed the most rapid degradation of 4-n-NP, while E2 could be removed most effectively by aerobic activated sludge, and sludge sorption had a remarkable effect on its removal within the initial 15?min of the experiments under three oxygen-supplying conditions.

AB The pharmaceuticals are biologically active compounds used to prevent and treat diseases. These pharmaceutical compounds were not fully metabolized by the human body and thus excreted out in the wastewater stream. Thus, the study on the treatment of synthetic hospital wastewater containing pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, carbamazepine, estradiol and venlafaxine) was conducted to understand the variation of the bacterial community in a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) at varying hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6, 12 and 18 h. The variation in bacterial community dynamics of SMBR was studied using high throughput sequencing. The removal of pharmaceuticals was uniform at varying HRT. The removal of both ibuprofen and estradiol was accounted for 90%, whereas a lower removal of venlafaxine (< 10%) and carbamazepine (> 5%) in SMBR was observed. The addition of pharmaceuticals alters the bacterial community structure and result in increased abundance of bacteria (e.g., Flavobacterium, Pedobacter, and Methylibium) reported to degrade toxic pollutant.

AB In this study, a bio-entrapped membrane reactor (BEMR) and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) were evaluated to study the organic treatment performance of pharmaceutical wastewater. The influences of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and salinity were also studied. The conventional biomass in the BEMR cannot tolerate well of the hypersaline conditions, resulting in total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 54.2-68.0%. On the other hand, microorganisms in the SMSMBR, which was seeded from coastal shore, strived and was able to degrade the complex organic in the presence of salt effectively, achieving 74.7-90.9% of TCOD removal efficiencies. Marine microorganisms able to degrade recalcitrant compounds and utilize hydrocarbon compounds were found in the SMSMBR, which resulted in higher organic removal efficiency than the BEMR. However, specific nitrifying activity decreased and inhibited due to the saline effect that led to poor ammonia nitrogen removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REMOVAL
AB Tannin rigid foams are presented as novel adsorbents for wastewater remediation. Although these materials are known since long time ago, this is one of the newest applications in environmental technology. The efficiency of the different combinations of reagents in the foam synthesis were studied by using Response Surface Methodology, and the optimum category was subsequently tested on dye, surfactant and pharmaceutical removal. The results are promising for the three types of pollutant. Structural differences based on FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and other superficial characterization techniques confirmed the intrinsic adsorption benefits of this optimum category if compared with other tannin rigid foams. Optimum tannin rigid foam was obtained with 0.03 g of furfuryl alcohol, 0.11 g of formaldehyde, 0.25 g of diethyl ether and 0.20 g of p-toluensulfonic acid per g of Weibull Black tannin extract. With this combination of reagents, up to 250 mg g(-1) of Methylene Blue removal was reached and a significant elimination of several dyes and surfactants was feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the last years, increasing attention has been paid on the presence of POPs in water. It has been found that wastewaters and wastewater treatment plant effluents are the main source of surface and ground water pollution. Therefore, it seems important to improve the removal efficiency of such compounds in wastewater treatment plant as well as to understand the different mechanisms involved. The implementation of a pilot scale MBR in parallel of a large conventional biological treatment plant will allow the comparison of both processes, as well as to observe the effect of a much higher SRT on POPs removal. Biodegradation efficiencies of target compounds are going to be assessed through the use of a microcalorimeter Bio-RC 1. Moreover, the effect of POPs concentration in the feeding solution will be studied. Attention will be focused on inhibition and adaptation to the chosen pollutants, through the analysis of the responses to POP's pulses and continuous flow.

AB BACKGROUND In the last decade, many researchers demonstrated the biological activities of native Bombyx mori silk sericin (SS), and its use is widespread in the cosmetic and biomedical field. However, SS is a polluting material from the silk fibroin textile industry. This paper aims to demonstrate that the industrial wastewater-derived SS has many biological properties, and can be used as an eco-friendly product for cosmetic/pharmaceutical purposes with an important impact on the circular economy.
   RESULTS We focused on the SS derived from an ad hoc extraction process or industrial degumming wastewater. Both products were preserved with three different methods: lyophilization, spray-drying and sterilization. All SS were characterized in terms of amino acid content, molecular weight, physical-chemical properties, morphology and size distribution; then we evaluated the biological properties, the cytocompatibility/cytoprotective profile, and the immunomodulatory abilities of SS. Free radical scavenging, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-elastase activities of waste SS were confirmed. Waste and standard SS were cytocompatible on human fibroblasts; all SS samples inhibited the proliferation of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner. Waste SS showed a significant effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10 release.
   CONCLUSIONS These results pave the way for using textile wastewater-derived SS to obtain high-value-added products for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical purposes. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Many pharmaceuticals are present in reclaimed wastewater and effluent-dominated water bodies used to irrigate edible crops. Previous research has shown that plants irrigated with reclaimed wastewater can accumulate pharmaceuticals. However, plant-driven processes that contribute to differences in accumulation among compounds are not well understood. Here, we tested the effects of exposure to mixtures on spinach accumulation and metabolism of four psychoactive pharmaceuticals found in reclaimed wastewater: carbamazepine, fluoxetine, amitriptyline, and lamotrigine. Coexposure of plants to carbamazepine and fluoxetine or amitriptyline decreased accumulation of the toxic carbamazepine metabolite 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine. Furthermore, we tested a simple transpiration-based accumulation model and found that transpiration is a strong predictor for accumulation of the studied compounds. Amitriptyline accumulated to a larger extent than predicted from transpiration alone, and we suggest the possibility that a transporter protein may be involved in its uptake. Our findings highlight the need to consider plant physiology and mixture effects in studying accumulation of polar and ionizable organic contaminants and their metabolites.

AB The pharmaceutical industry produces carbon-rich liquid wastes which have been generally qualified as hazardous. A significant proportion of these carbon-rich wastes are currently sent for incineration, although they could be utilised. It was found that the majority of the liquid wastes investigated in this study could be used in biological N-removal as carbon sources for denitrification in domestic wastewater treatment, or for anaerobic biogas production. The volatile content could be separated and the solvents re-utilised, the residual toxic organic compounds could be decomposed by wet oxidation and subsequently sent for biological treatment.

AB Domestic wastewater (WW) contains a large number of pathogenic viruses that are not significantly reduced in most WW treatment processes and are found in high numbers in the effluent of conventionally disinfected WW. In this study, secondary WW effluent bench-scale disinfection efficacy experiments with two different peracetic acid (PAA) formulations (15 and 22% peracetic acid) and lowpressure ultraviolet irradiation (LP-UV) were carried out using Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) as a clinically relevant surrogate for enteric viruses and Escherichia coli (E. coli) as the disinfection efficacy control. Efficacy experiments were done in a test matrix of medium-pressure UV (MP-UV) decontaminated secondary WW effluent under representative PAA doses and LP-UV fluences used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Membrane filtration technique was used to determine Log(10) CFU reductions of E. coli and a tissue culture infectious dose 50% assay (TCID50) for Logio TCID50 reduction of CVB3. The CVB3 proved to be quite resistant to PAA with <1 Log(10) TCID50 reduction to concentrations <= 50 mg/L at a contact time of 15 min, and highly susceptible to LP-UV at 20 mJ/cm(2). Concurrent use of both formulations of 3 mg/L PAA with 20 mJ/cm(2) LP-UV achieved -4 Log(10) TCID50 reduction. The E. coli results showed >5 Log(10) CFU reductions at a contact time of 15 min with both 3 mg/L PAA formulations, 20 mJ/cm(2) LP-UV treatment alone, and combined with both 1.5 mg/L PAA formulations. The E. coli efficacy data were consistent with that reported in the literature and showed to be comparable to conventional chlorine disinfection. The CVB3 efficacy data has shown that PAA alone may not be suitable for the reduction of enteric viruses in secondary wastewater effluent, but this is also the case for chlorine-based disinfectants. The results from this study showed that the use of PAA with LP-UV at reasonable concentrations (1.5 mg/L) and fluence (20 mJ/cm(2)) can significantly reduce the PAA use and meet wastewater disinfection goals for both E. coli and CVs. However, the concurrent use of PAA with LP-UV did not lead to significant synergy in disinfection efficacy in wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem pollution due to the lack of or inefficient wastewater treatment coverage in small communities is still a matter of great concern, even in developed countries. This study assesses the seasonal performance of 4 different full-scale wastewater technologies that have been used in small communities (<2000 population equivalent) for more than 10 years in terms of emerging contaminant (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and NH4-N removal efficiency. The studied technologies, which were selected due to their widespread use, included two intensive treatment systems (an extended aeration system (AS) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC)) and two extensive treatment systems (a constructed wetland (CW) and a waste stabilization pond (WSP)), all located in northeastern Spain. The studied compounds belonged to the groups of pharmaceuticals, sunscreen compounds, fragrances, antiseptics, flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides and plasticizers. The 25 ECs occurred in wastewater at concentrations ranging from undetectable to 80 mu g L-1. The average removal efficiency was 42% for the CW, 62% for the AS, 63% for the RBC and 82% for the WSP. All the technologies except the WSP system showed seasonal variability in the removal of ECs. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that, whilst all the technologies were capable of decreasing the aquatic risk, only the WSP yielded no risk in both seasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The activated sludge organisms of a pharmaceutical sewage plant heavily loaded with organic wastes were studied in a series of 11 samples collected monthly. High population densities of the microflora and microfauna indicate that the waste water contains no toxic compounds beyond tolerable limits. The organic substance on average amounts to 16 g dry mass/l; it consists of 96% prokaryotic (bacterial) and 4% eukaryotic (protozoan) biomass. Related to suspended solids the protozoan biomass constitutes 2%; 4 tons protozoa (wet mass, corresponding to 800 kg dry mass) are produced in 1400 m3 waste water daily. The high organic load (21 kg BOD5/m3.d), the short retention time (24 h), the high temperature (30-degrees-C) and the lack of distinct flocs favour few well adapted polysaprobic protozoan species. The morphology and ecology of 7 ciliate species found in fresh sludge are described, including Parastrongylidium oswaldi n. sp.

AB Owing to their widespread use, pharmaceuticals have become important pollutants of the aquatic environment. Pharmaceuticals and parasites can affect the immunity, physiology and behaviour of target organisms, both singly and through interaction. In this study, we related pharmaceutical concentration, parasite infection and condition in brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario) collected at localities upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The sites were separated by a weir preventing fish migration. Pharmaceutical number and concentrations differed significantly between sites. Antibiotics and antidepressants were found at the highest concentrations at both localities. Though fish condition and overall parasite abundance did not differ between sites, there was a significant difference in parasite community composition. A higher abundance of monogenean ectoparasites, along with a lower abundance of endoparasites, was observed at the downstream locality. The adverse effect of pharmaceutical load on ecto- and endoparasitic species on brown trout was further confirmed at the individual level using multivariate analysis. Both the number and concentration of pharmaceuticals in fish tissues reflected their high incidence in the environment, confirming the ability of trout to bioaccumulate pharmaceuticals. This could have important consequences on fish health, particularly in small streams where STP effluent represents a high proportion of stream flow.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) is a non-steroidal analgesic and antiphlogistic. Due to its tremendous use, DCF can be found in the environment, especially in sewage, but also surface waters, ground and drinking water. Previous studies indicated that DCF can modulate the reproductive physiology of fish by altering the expression of important key enzymes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad-axis (HPG-axis) and might act as an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Other studies, however, demonstrated that DCF does not exhibit any estrogenicity. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether an exposure to DCF can affect reproductive behavior and physiology of adult male X. laevis by analyzing DCF effects on the mate calling behavior of the frogs and on gene expression patterns of key biomarkers of the HPG-axis. In addition, plasma sex steroid levels were determined to gain detailed insights into the mechanisms of DCF action. We could demonstrate that DCF can act as EDC by exhibiting slight estrogenic modes of action. In addition, pharmacological impacts on gonadal steroidogenesis could be revealed leading to imbalances in sex steroid levels and ratios. DCF furthermore altered the calling behavior of exposed males, potentially reducing the mating and reproductive success of the frogs, possibly leading to severe population effects.

AB The viability of a multi-barrier treatment (MBT) for safe discharge or potential reuse of synthetic industrial wastewater was evaluated in this study. The proposed MBT consists of microfiltration membrane pre-treatment (MF), followed by hydrogen peroxide photolysis (H2O2/UVC) using a medium pressure Hg lamp (MP) and granulate activated carbon (GAC). The synthetic wastewater (SIWW) obtained by addition of different industrial organic pollutant (orange II, phenol, 4-chlorophenol and phenanthrene) to the effluent taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was used in this study.
   At optimal operational conditions complete degradation of added contaminants, about 85% of total mineralization and total disinfection were achieved after MBT treatment. Toxicity tests with Vibrio fischeri and Paracentrotus lividus sea-urchin (fertilization and embryo-larval development assays) were conducted with water after each treatment step and drastic decrease of toxicity was observed after applied process. However, it was demonstrated that after H2O2/UVC step toxicity of water significantly increased and was even higher than that of SIWW. Novel equation for estimation of UVC dose was introduced as one of the most important scaling parameter. The main operational and maintenance cost (O&M) of MBT process was evaluated in this work. Thus, the high quality of the obtained effluent suggests its suitability for water reuse or safe discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ozonation to achieve removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents, with pH values in the upper and lower regions of the typical range for Swedish wastewater, was investigated. The main aim was to study the effects of varying pH values (6.0 and 8.0), and if small additions of H2O2 prior to ozone treatment could improve the removal and lower the reaction time. The effluents studied differed in their chemical characteristics, particularly in terms of alkalinity (65.3-427 mg center dot l(-1) HCO3-), COD (18.2-41.8 mg center dot l(-1)), DOC (6.9-12.5 mg center dot l(-1)), ammonium content (0.02-3.6 mg center dot l(-1)) and specific UV absorbance (1.78-2.76 l center dot mg(-1)center dot m(-1)). As expected, lower ozone decomposition rates were observed in the effluents at pH 6.0 compared to pH 8.0. When pH 8.0 effluents were ozonated, a higher degree of pharmaceutical removal occurred in the effluent with low specific UV absorbance. For pH 6.0 effluents, the removal of pharmaceuticals was most efficient in the effluent with the lowest organic content. The addition of H2O2 had no significant effect on the quantitative removal of pharmaceuticals but enhanced the ozone decomposition rate. Thus, H2O2 addition increased the reaction rate. In practice, this will mean that the reactor volume needed for the ozonation of wastewater effluents can be reduced.

AB Pharmaceuticals remain in treated wastewater used to irrigate agricultural crops. Their effect on terrestrial plants is practically unknown. Here we tested whether these compounds can be considered as plant stress inducers. Several features characterize the general stress response in plants: production of reactive oxygen species acting as stress-response signals, MAPKs signaling cascade inducing expression of defense genes, heat shock proteins preventing protein denaturation and degradation, and amino acids playing signaling roles and involved in osmoregulation. Tomato seedlings bathing in a cocktail of pharmaceuticals (Carbamazepine, Valporic acid, Phenytoin, Diazepam, Lamotrigine) or in Carbamazepine alone, at different concentrations and during different time-periods, were used to study the patterns of stress-related markers. The accumulation of the stress-related biomarkers in leaf and root tissues pointed to a cumulative stress response, mobilizing the cell protection machinery to avoid metabolic modifications and to restore homeostasis. The described approach is suitable for the investigation of stress response of different crop plants to various contaminants present in treated wastewater.

AB Female sexual hormones have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to the effects that they cause by interfering in the endocrine system. Many contemporary studies have sought to monitor some of the main female sexual hormones in surface waters in Brazil. Current article evaluates the presence of 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, estrone and progesterone in the surface waters of Curitiba and the surrounding metropolitan area in the state of Parana, Brazil, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), performed at 7 different sites. The study revealed that a range of concentrations between 0.07 and 13.45 mu g L-1 of female sexual hormones was extant; higher values than these were found in other regions of Brazil and in other countries. Higher concentrations have been attributed to the region' s sanitation due to large sewage amounts. Sewage discharge has also been confirmed by results of limnological parameters.

AB Fluoroquinolones are extensively used in medicine due to their antimicrobial activity. Their presence in water inhibits microorganism activity in conventional wastewater treatment plants. This study aims to evaluate the technical feasibility of applying heterogeneous catalytic ozonation to eliminate ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a representative of fluoroquinolone antibiotics normally present in municipal wastewater discharges. Experiments were conducted in a semi-batch stirred slurry reactor, using 0.7 L of 100 mg L-1 CIP aqueous solution, at pH 3 and 30 degrees C. Experimental results show that single ozonation can easily oxidise CIP molecules (68%) within the first 5 min, leading to the generation of refractory oxidation by-products. However, when heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is applied using iron oxide supported on MFI synthetic zeolite, total degradation of CIP is observed at 5 min and a higher mineralisation rate is obtained. A novel sequential process is developed for CIP mineralisation. In a first step, a flash single ozonation is applied and CIP molecules are broken down. Then, a catalytic ozonation step is conducted by adding the Fe/MFI catalyst into the reactor. As a result of catalyst addition, 44% of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is eliminated within the first 15 min, compared to single ozonation where only 13% of TOC removal is reached in the same time. The application of this sequential process to a real wastewater effluent spiked with CIP leads to 52% of TOC removal.

AB The fungus Pleurotus ostreatus was investigated to assess its ability to remove diclofenac, ketoprofen, and atenolol spiked at 10 mg/L each one in hospital wastewater. The degradation test was carried out in a fluidized bed bioreactor testing both the batch and the continuous mode (hydraulic retention time in the range 1.63-3 days). In batch mode, diclofenac disappeared in less than 24 h, ketoprofen was degraded up to almost 50% in 5 days while atenolol was not removed. In continuous mode, diclofenac and ketoprofen removals were about 100% and 70% respectively; atenolol degradation was negligible during the first 20 days but it increased up to 60% after a peak of laccase production and notable biomass growth. In order to identify the enzymatic system involved, further experiments were carried out in flasks. Purified laccase completely transformed atenolol and diclofenac in less than 5 h, but not ketoprofen. In vivo experiments suggested that cytochrome P450 could be involved in diclofenac and ketoprofen degradation, while partial correlation studies confirmed the role of laccase in atenolol and diclofenac degradation. Two intermediates of diclofenac and ketoprofen were detected by nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover P. ostreatus was able to reduce chemical oxygen demand of the hospital wastewater which is an important advantage comparing to other fungi in order to develop a wastewater treatment process.

AB Water reuse for aquifer recharge could be an important route for the introduction of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) into the environment. The installation of a Horizontal Permeable Reactive Barrier (H-PRB) could constitute a tertiary treatment process to remove EOCs from treated domestic wastewater prior to recharge activities. The sorption-desorption behaviour of six neutral EOCs present in treated domestic wastewater (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, 4-acetamidoantipyrine (4-AAA) and 4-formylaminoantipyrine (4-FAA)) has been evaluated. Clinoptilolite and palygorskite have been studied as sorbents to be installed in the H-PRB. Batch tests were carried out using an EOC initial concentration ranging from 5 to 100 mu g L-1. Apart from acetaminophen and caffeine, both materials showed a limited sorption capacity of neutral EOCs (K-d = 0.63-5.42 L kg(-1)). In general, the experimental results show that EOCs exhibit a higher sorption affinity for clinoptilolite than for palygorskite. With the exception of carbamazepine, the sorption of the compounds occurs mainly by interactions with mineral surfaces as indicated by the comparison of the partition coefficients into organic matter and into mineral surfaces. According to the molecular geometry of the compounds and the sorption sequences observed, it appears that the dimensions of the organic molecules play a key role in the sorption process. All the studied EOCs exhibit irreversible sorption and sorption-desorption hysteresis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work describes a simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous isolation, enrichment, identification and quantitation of selected antiretroviral drugs; emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz in aqueous samples and plants. The analytical method was based on microwave extraction and hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction technique coupled with ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. A multivariate approach via a half-fractional factorial design was used focusing on six factors; donor phase pH, acceptor phase HCI concentration, extraction time, stirring rate, supported liquid membrane carrier composition and salt content. The optimal enrichment factors for emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz from aqueous phase were 78, 111 and 24, respectively. The analytical method yielded recoveries in the range of 86 to 111%, and quantitation limits for emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz in wastewater were 0.033, 0.10 and 0.53 mu g L-1, respectively. The drugs were detected in most samples with concentrations up to 37.6 mu g L-1 recorded for efavirenz in wastewater effluent Roots of the water hyacinth plant had higher concentrations of the investigated drugs ranging from 7.4 to 29.6 mu g kg(-1). Overall, hollow fibre liquid phase microextraction proved to be an ideal tool for isolating and preconcentrating the selected antiretroviral drugs from environmental samples.

AB Background: Removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater by post-ozonation has been investigated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) temporarily upgraded with full-scale ozonation, followed by sand filtration, as an additional treatment step of the secondary effluent. Here, the SPEAR (species at risk) indicator was used to analyse macroinvertebrate abundance data that were collected in the receiving stream before, during and after ozonation to investigate whether ozonation improved the water quality.
   Results: The SPEAR values indicate a better water quality downstream the WWTP during ozonation. With ozonation the relative abundance of vulnerable macroinvertebrates in the stream receiving the treated wastewater increases from 18 % (CI 15-21 %) to 30 % (CI 28-32 %). This increase of 12 % (CI 8-16 %) indicates improved ecological quality of the stream and shifts classification according to the Water Framework Directive from poor to moderate.
   Conclusions: The SPEAR concept, originally developed to indicate pesticide stress, also appears to indicate toxic stress by a mixture of various micropollutants including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and pesticides. The responsiveness of the SPEAR indicator means that those macroinvertebrates that are vulnerable to pesticide pollution are also vulnerable to micropollutants from WWTPs. The change in the macroinvertebrate community downstream the WWTP indicates that toxicity by pollutants decreased by more than one order of magnitude during ozonation. Ozonation followed by sand filtration has favourable impacts on the composition of the macroinvertebrate community and can improve the water quality in the receiving stream.

AB The treatment of domestic wastewater using constructed wetlands (CWs) is common in the Czech Republic; however, the treatment of agro-industrial wastewater is still at the beginning of its application. A hybrid CW consisting of two horizontal filters (HF1 and HF2), one vertical filter (VF), and three stabilization ponds (SP1-SP3) was put into operation in 2012 in Chramce, Usti region, Czech Republic. The hybrid system treats mixed household and agro-industrial wastewater mainly from sheep farms and wine and fruit juice production factories. The filters are planted with Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea, Iris pseudacorus, Iris sibirica, Glyceria maxima, and Lythrum salicaria. In a fed-batch operation, the inflow values vary on the basis of wine processing seasons. In high season, it reaches 17,012 mg L-1 of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 1806 mg L-1 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), and 43,723 mg L-1 of total suspended solids (TSS) on average. Despite such high inlet concentrations, the removal efficiency (RE) for the three selected parameters reached up to 99% for all the parameters. In this work, the removal of four pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) in the hybrid system was studied as well. The CW performed high RE for all of the four pharmaceuticals when the RE of diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen was 81.1%, 93.2%, 96.7%, and 78.3%, respectively.

AB Sulfadiazine (SD) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) are widely used sulfonamide antibiotics, which are present as contaminants in surface waters and are known to undergo phototransformation. This kinetic study was conducted to identify the processes responsible for their phototransformation in sunlit surface waters. Water samples from the Thur River (Switzerland) and from a pilot wastewater treatment plant, as well as aqueous solutions of two well-characterized natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracts, namely Suwannee River and Pony Lake fulvic acids (SRFA, PLFA), were examined. Both sulfonamides were found to undergo direct and indirect phototransformation, with contributions of excited triplet states of DOM and of effluent organic matter (EfOM) and possibly of hydroxyl radical and other unidentified reactive species. Under simulated sunlight, SMX mainly reacted through direct phototransformation, with a certain contribution of indirect phototransformation occurring for a wastewater effluent. The behavior of SD was found to be more diverse. For river waters, wastewater effluents and PLFA solutions, indirect phototransformation was predominant, while for SRFA solutions direct phototransformation prevailed. The rates of phototransformation of SD were interpreted as the result of a complex interplay between the photosensitizing and the inhibitory effect of DOM/EfOM, with an additional component related to the nitrite ion as a source of photoproduced hydroxyl radical. For typical conditions found in surface waters comparable to the Thur River, phototransformation half-lives on the order of 3-13 d were estimated for the two studied sulfonamides.

AB Integrating powdered activated carbon (PAC) into wastewater tertiary treatment is a promising technology to reduce organic micro-pollutant (OMP) discharge into the receiving waters. To take advantage of the existing tertiary filter, PAC was pre-embedded inside the filter bed acting as a fixed-bed adsorber. The pre-embedding (i.e. immobilization) of PAC was realized by direct dosing a PAC solution on the filter top, which was then promoted to penetrate into the filter media by a down-flow of tap water. In order to examine the effectiveness of this PAC pre-embedded filter towards OMP removal, batch adsorption tests, representing PAC contact reactor (with the same PAC mass-to-treated water volume ratio as in the PAC pre-embedded filter) were performed as references. Moreover, as a conventional dosing option, PAC was dosed continuously with the filter influent (i.e. the wastewater secondary effluent with the investigated OMPs). Comparative results confirmed a higher OMP removal efficiency associated with the PAC pre-embedded filter, as compared to the batch system with a practical PAC residence time. Furthermore, over a filtration period of 10 h (approximating a realistic filtration cycle for tertiary filters), the continuous dosing approach resulted in less OMP removal. Therefore, it was concluded that the pre-embedding approach can be preferentially considered when integrating PAC into the wastewater tertiary treatment for OMP elimination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Potential health risks derived from wastewater reuse in agriculture have been evaluated with Risk Assessment modelling techniques, in a case study involving the effluents of two Spanish wastewater treatment plants. One of the plants applies primary and secondary treatment, and the other one applies an additional tertiary treatment. Health risks were assessed on the basis of ingesting contaminated food, due to exposure to: (i) 22 chemical pollutants, namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and priority pollutants included in the European Framework Directive, and (ii) microorganisms, namely enterovirus. Chemical Risk Assessment has been carried out following the European Commission's technical guidelines, while risks from exposure to viruses have been evaluated by means of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, assuming a virus to coliform ratio of 1:105. The results of the chemical assessment show that there is a margin of safety above 100 for all substances, with the exception of gemfibrozil, for which the mean margin of safety (MOS) is above 100, but the lower bound of MOS with a 95 % confidence interval lies in the 3-4 range. A MOS under 100 was also found for 2,3,7,8-TCDD in one of the effluents. The assessment of risks from viruses shows a very low probability of infection. The overall results show that risks are lower for the plant applying tertiary treatment, especially concerning microbiological parameters.

AB The reduction of ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 254 nm (UV(254)) and true color were identified as appropriate surrogates to assess the oxidation of six pharmaceuticals (i.e., carbamazepine, meprobamate, dilantin, primidone, atenolol, and iopromide) during ozonation of wastewater. Three tertiary-treated wastewaters were evaluated during oxidation with ozone (O(3)) and O(3) coupled with hydrogen peroxide (O(3)/H(2)O(2)). The correlation between pharmaceutical oxidation and removal of UV(254) was dependent upon the reactivity of each specific compound toward ozone, as measured by the second-order rate constant (k'(O3)). Oxidation of compounds with k'(O3) > 10(3) M(-1) s(-1) correlated well (R(2) > 0.73) with UV(254) reduction between 0-50%. Oxidation of compounds with apparent k'(O3) < 10 M(-1) s(-1) resulted primarily from hydroxyl radicals and correlated well (R(2) > 0.80) with the UV(254) reduction of 15-65%. The removal of true color also correlated well (R(2) > 0.85) with the oxidation of pharmaceuticals during the ozonation of two wastewaters. These correlations demonstrate that UV(254) reduction and true color removal maybe used as surrogates to evaluate pharmaceutical oxidation in the presence or absence of dissolved ozone residual during advanced wastewater treatment with O(3) or O(3)/H(2)O(2). The use of online UV(254) measurements would allow wastewater utilities to optimize the ozone dose required to meet their specific treatment objectives.

AB The fates of psychoactive pharmaceuticals, including two antischizophrenics, six sedative-hypnotic-anxiolytics, four antidepressants, four antihypertensives, and their select metabolites, were determined in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Albany area of New York. All target psychoactive pharmaceuticals and their metabolites were found at a mean concentration that ranged from 0.98 (quetiapine) to 1220 ng/L (atenolol) in wastewater and from 0.26 (lorazepam) to 1490 ng/g dry weight (sertraline) in sludge. In this study, the fraction of psychoactive pharmaceuticals that was sorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) was calculated for the first time. Over 50% of the total mass of aripiprazole, norquetiapine, norsertraline, citalopram, desmethyl citalopram, propranolol, verapamil, and norverapamil was found sorbed to SPM in the influent. The mass loadings, i.e., influx, of target psychoactive pharmaceuticals in WWTPs ranged from 0.91 (diazepam) to 347 mg/d/1000 inhabitants (atenolol), whereas the environmental emissions ranged from 0.01 (dehydro-aripiprazole) to 316 mg/d/1000 inhabitants (atenolol). The highest calculated removal efficiencies were found for antischizophrenics (quetiapine = 88%; aripiprazole = 71%). However, the removal of some psychoactive pharmaceuticals through adsorption onto sludge was minimal (<1% of the initial mass load), which suggests that bio-degradation and/or chemical-transformation are the dominant mechanisms of removal of these pharmaceuticals in WWTPs.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent contains pharmaceuticals and personal care products known to affect fish health and reproduction. The microbiome is a community of bacteria integral in maintaining host health and is influenced by species, diet, and environment. This study investigated changes in the diversity and composition of the gut content microbiome of rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) at ten sites on the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Gut contents were collected in fall 2018 from these fish at sites upstream and downstream of two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs; Waterloo and Kitchener). 16S rRNA genes were sequenced to determine the composition and diversity (alpha and beta) of microbial taxa present. Gut content bacterial alpha diversity increased downstream of both WWTP outfalls; dominance of bacterial amplicon sequence variants decreased compared to upstream fish. Fish collected at different sites had distinct bacterial communities, with upstream samples dominant in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and downstream samples increasingly abundant in Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. In mammals, increased abundance of Proteobacteria is indicative of microbial dysbiosis and has been linked to altered health outcomes, but this is not yet known for fish. This research indicates that the fish gut content microbiome was altered downstream of WWTP effluent outfalls and could lead to negative health outcomes.

AB Several reports have elucidated the removal of pharmaceutical residues in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, there remains a need to determine the spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals in the unit processes of full-scale municipal WWTPs. Herein, spatial variations of fifteen pharmaceuticals in the unit processes of four full-scale municipal WWTPs were assessed by analyzing both solid and liquid samples. Furthermore, different pathways of each pharmaceutical such as biodegradation, adsorption, deconjugation, and electrostatic interaction were investigated. Pharmaceutical mass loading were measured at various points for the different unit process and evaluated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The average mass loading of acetaminophen and caffeine decreased tremendously in the first biological treatment process regardless of the process configuration. In contrast, a temporary increase was observed in the mass loading of ibuprofen in the anaerobic and/or anoxic processes, which was presumably caused by deconjugation. Additionally, the adverse effect of coagulation on ibuprofen removal was validated. The major removal mechanism for the selected antibiotics, except for sulfamethoxazole, was the adsorption by biosolids due to electrostatic interaction. Subsequently, a drastic decrease was observed in their mass loadings in the solid-liquid separation process of the WWTPs. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) shows excellent capability for mitigation of pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater because it comprises a high concentration of biosolids that act as adsorbents. The evaluation of the spatial variations of the selected pharmaceuticals in different unit processes provides valuable information on their behavior and removal mechanisms.

AB In aquatic systems, some substances considered as endocrine disruptors have been detected, which can be due to their incomplete elimination in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and inadequate disposal of pharmaceuticals. Among these contaminants are 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and caffeine (CAF). Moreover, it has been reported that this kind of contaminants may provoke different adverse effects in many aquatic organisms. Because of that, in the present study, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) coupled with the Fenton process was evaluated for EE2 and CAF removal spiked in wastewater samples. First, the best reaction conditions were established in each process. For UASB reactor, two hydraulic retention times (HRT 8 and 24 h) were evaluated, achieving the highest chemical organic demand (COD) removal (70 %) and drug elimination (84 %-86 %) with HRT 24 h. Subsequently, Fenton process was conducted at pH 3 with different levels of Fe2+ (0.05-0.5 mmol/L) and molar ratios Fe2+:H2O2 (1:1-1:10). Better results were obtained with 0.5 mmol Fe2+/L, and 1:10 ratio molar Fe2+:H2O2. Finally, UASB-Fenton coupled system allowed 80 % of COD decrease, almost complete removal of drugs and the toxicity of samples on Vibrio fischeri was reduced from 73 % to 30 %, demonstrating that this coupled system is a promising and efficient system for pharmaceutical compounds removal from wastewater.

AB Occurrence of antibiotics and heavy metals, together with concentrations of conventional pollution indicators were assessed in digested piggery wastewater (DPW) generated in ten large-scale pig farms in Jiaxing City, China. Results showed that water quality of DPW varied in different farms as well as in different seasons. Digested piggery wastewater pollution tended to be less serious in Summer than in Spring, Autumn and Winter. Conventional pollution indicators of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (TP) in Spring ranged 1008 - 18479 mg/L, 205 - 2228 mg/L, 119 - 1936 mg/L and 32.6 - 306 mg/L, respectively, being four times higher than those in Summer. Pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in DPW was very severe for all farms. Six heavy metals (copper, Cu; zinc, Zn; lead, Pb; cadmium, Cd; nickel, Ni; and chromium, Cr) and ten antibiotics (three tetracyclines, two sulfonamides, three macrolides and two quinolones) were detectable in all the ten farms. Copper and Zn accounted for 97 +/- 3% of the total heavy metals concentrations, and their concentrations reached the discharge limits of 0.5 mg/L (Cu) and 1.5 mg/L (Zn) in most cases. The total concentrations of the ten antibiotics were in the range of 0.155 - 1,090 mu g/L. Heavy metals and antibiotics should be given intensive attention during resource utilization and treatment of DPW.

AB A continuously operated laboratory scale anaerobic and aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) combined with O-3/H2O2 process was experimented for antibiotic fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 26.6% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed, and 931.75 mg/L of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was produced under the optimum conditions of the anaerobic MBBR at an influent pH of 6.5, hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12 hr and organic loading rate (OLR) of 13 kg COD/(m(3).d) for the hydrolysis/acidification process. In addition, 91.0% of COD was removed at 1.5 m(3)/h of aeration rate with the aerobic MBBR. The shape of bacteria inside the bio-carriers was characterized by a scanning electron microscope. The anaerobic MBBR bacteria were observed as long bacilli, and the aerobic MBBR bacteria were observed as mainly cocci and short bacilli. Finally, the residual non-biodegraded pollutants were mineralized by O-3/H2O2 oxidation with 0.5 of H2O2/O-3 molar ratio and 15 min of reaction time. The total removal efficiencies of COD and color reached 99.2 and 98.7%, respectively. Thus, this method might offer an effective way to treat wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics and high salinity can damage traditional biological treatment and result in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. However, the fate of ARGs in BES and their correlations with microbial communities and horizontal genes transfer are unknown. In this study, we investigated the response of ARGs to bio-electrochemical treatment of chloramphenicol wastewater and their potential hosts under different salinities. Three ARGs encoding efflux pump (cmlA, floR and tetC), one class 1 integron integrase encoding gene (intl1), and sul1 gene (associate with intl1) were analyzed. Correlation analysis between microbial community and ARGs revealed that the abundances of potential hosts of ARGs were strongly affected by salinity, which further determined the alteration in ARGs abundances under different salinities. There were no significant correlations between ARGs and intl1, indicating that horizontal gene transfer was not related to the important changes in ARGs. Moreover, the chloramphenicol removal efficiency was enhanced under a moderate salinity, attributed to the altered microbial community driven by salinity. Therefore, microbial community shift is the major factor for the changes of ARGs and chloramphenicol removal efficiency in BES under different salinities. This study provides new insights on the mechanisms underlying the alteration of ARGs in BES treating high-salinity pharmaceutical wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Direct photolysis (UV) and ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) treatment using KrCl excilamp (222 nm) were studied and compared in terms of energy requirements for removal of organic micropollutants atrazine (ATZ) and triclosan (TCS) spiked into Milli-Q water, municipal wastewater effluents, deep and surface lake water with dissolved organic carbon of 1 mg/L. The obtained fluence-based rate constants in the range of 2.1-6.2 x 10(-2) cm(2)/mJ and UV fluences for 90% removal (UV90) in the range of 42-153 mJ/cm(2) showed that UV/H2O2 process was more efficient than direct UV in degrading both micropollutants in all water matrices except wastewater. In terms of electrical energy per order (E-EO), the addition of H2O2 decreased the required energy by a factor of 1.4-2.4 for ATZ removal from Milli-Q water and lake waters. For TCS, the E-EO was relatively constant (0.44-0.51 kWh/m(3)) for both UV and UV/H2O2 treatments of Milli-Q water and lake waters. Regarding wastewater, similar UV90 fluences and the additional energy requirement for H2O2 increased the E-EO values for removal of ATZ and TCS. Despite the much lower required UV90 fluences compared with low-pressure mercury lamps, the low radiant efficiency of KrCl excilamp of 5% resulted in E-EO requirements up to 2.0 kWh/m(3).

AB This study describes a promising porous and efficient adsorbent, a sulfonic acid (-SO3H) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF-SO3H), for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water and wastewater. COF-SO3H was prepared through introducing sulfonic acid polar functionalities via a facile solvothermal synthesis method. Studies have shown that COF-SO3H has a strong affinity for the thirteen drugs investigated in this study, especially for diclofenac (DCF). The maximum adsorption capacity for DCF was 770 mg g(-1), which amounted to 9.3 times that of commercial AC, 1.5 times that of graphene oxide (GO), and 3 times that of 18% SO3-UiO-66. Further discoveries were that the adsorption isotherm data conformed well with the Langmuir model. It was also found that adsorption of DCF follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and thermodynamic values, Delta H < 0 and Delta G < 0, showed the exothermic nature and spontaneity of the adsorption process. Additionally, the adsorption mechanisms observed in this experiment, such as pi-pi interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds, were also verified through various characterization methods. The cyclic regeneration of adsorbents and the effects of water quality constituents were estimated to assess performance in actual water/wastewater systems. Ultimately, the overall results of this study emphasized the suitability of the COF-SO3H adsorbent to remove micropollutants from real water and wastewater systems.

AB Sometrace organic contaminants (TrOCs) can be considered as ubiquitous contaminants since the 1950s, and the study of their historical distribution within river sediments allows us to better understand the temporal variation of the chemical quality of sediments, and make assumptions about the most insightful forcings impacting these distributions. In this study, the occurrence of 41 TrOCs of various classes (i.e. pharmaceutical products and pesticides) was studied in a sedimentary core sampled in a disused dock along the Seine River, France. This core covers a 60 year-long period between 1944 and 2003, and 23 TrOCs were detected at least once. Their concentrations mainly ranged between 1 and 10 ng g(-1) within the core, except for tetracycline that exhibited higher concentrations (similar to hundreds of ng.g(-1)). The dating of the core, based on previous studies, enabled the characterization of the changes since 1945, potentially impacted by (i) the sewer connectivity, (ii) the upgrading of wastewater treatment technologies, (iii) historical modifications in the use of each TrOC, and (iv) the sedimentary composition. In every case the deepest occurrence of each TrOC in the core matched its market authorization date, indicating the potential of TrOC to be used as chronomarkers. This study also reveals that the recent upgrading of wastewater treatment technologies within the watershed decreased the concentrations of each TrOC, despite an increase in TrOC diversity in the most recent years.

AB Inoculum plays an important role in establishing a bacterial community in biological treatment reactors. Two identical anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were inoculated with sludge from a municipal (R1) or pharmaceutical (R2) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to investigate the influence of inoculum on the start-up of SBRs by comparing the pollutants removal efficiencies and bacterial community. Both SBRs were successfully started up within 30 d. Comparably high chemical oxygen demand (97% +/- 2%), total nitrogen (89% +/- 8%) and ammonia (96% +/- 6%) removals were achieved in both SBRs. But R1 performed much better in total phosphorus removal (95% +/- 6% vs. 69% +/- 7%) than R2 due to a higher relative abundance of phosphorous-accumulating organisms (5.5% vs. 0.4%) in R1 at the end of the experiment. The bacterial community structures were distinctly different in the inoculating sludge, and no trend of becoming similar was observed all the time. Candidatus Competibacter was enriched to be the most dominant bacteria in both R1 (27.3%) and R2 (19.8%) during the start-up. However, Candidatus Moranbacteria (16.2%) and Roseiflexus (4.2%) were only dominant in R1, whereas Zoogloea (10.5%) and Anaerolineaceae (9.7%) were only dominant in R2 finally. These results indicated that inoculating sludge is one deciding factor shaping the microbiomes in bioreactors, and activated sludge from municipal WWTPs was a potential inoculum to start-up industrial wastewater biotreatment reactors with desirable performances.

AB Most studies dedicated to organic micropollutants (OMPs) removal from wastewater effluents by adsorption onto activated carbon (AC) only consider a few conventional AC properties. The link between OMPs removal and these properties is often missing, which limits the understanding of the adsorption process and the interpretation of the results. The chemical, physical and textural properties of seven newly commercialized micro-grain activated carbons (mu GACs) were determined to assess their influence on the removal of 28 OMPs. Conventional batch tests with wastewater effluent showed that a high percentage of microporous volume (>65%) was detrimental for the removal of 10 OMPs, probably due to a higher blockage of micropores by dissolved organic matter (DOM). The removal of 5 OMPs was correlated with mu GACs surface chemistry properties (i.e. charge) which were potentially modified by DOM adsorption or inorganic species, thus favoring the adsorption of positively-charged compounds. A combination of OMPs properties including their charge, hydrophobicity and minimal projection area could explain their removal. Correlations were found between the removal of several OMPs and UV254, suggesting that DOM and OMPs interacted with each other or followed similar adsorption mechanisms. A decrease in mu GACs particle size had a positive impact on UV254 removal under continuous-flow conditions in columns representative of a large-scale pilot due to better expansion.

AB Too low concentrations of organic pollutants as well as too high loads of toxic contaminants and/or other extreme conditions of (waste)waters may impede their efficient treatment by conventional biological technologies. Micropollutants typically occur in only minute amounts in the aquatic environment, which is not in favor of their productive biodegradation and may lead to infinitely low degradation rates. Conventional bioprocesses could even collapse in response to too toxic or otherwise extreme conditions of the waters to be treated. Advanced biological water treatment processes aim to overcome the performance limits of conventional biological processes, and make use of isolated enzymes and whole organisms. Current approaches involve enzyme immobilization to yield biocatalytically active nanomaterials, and bioelectrochemical systems employing immobilized microorganisms for wastewater treatment along with energy production. Such applications are mostly still at the experimental stage, and issues related to process upscaling, long-term stability, and cost efficiency still need to be solved. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) retain the biocatalytically active sludge in the system. They can be augmented with additional degrader organisms or used in combination with physicochemical processes such as activated carbon adsorption and ozonation. MBRs have already successfully been tested at the pilot and sometimes even at full scale. Constructed wetlands also have also the potential to remove micropollutants from urban wastewater. They may be considered as an alternative for wastewater treatment in small and scattered communities, and for the final step in the treatment of special wastewaters.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted, using a randomized block design, including twelve heavy metal (Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb) mixture treatments, with each metal participating in the treatment with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg, respectively. Common beet (Beta vulgaris L.) was chosen as test plant. The plants were irrigated with treated municipal wastewater taken from the Wastewater Treatment Plant of the town of Amaliada, N.W., Peloponnese, Greece. The experiment aimed at studying the interactions between heavy metals and macro-microelements, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The basic scope was to shed some light on the potential environmental implications, of these interactions on the soil PPCPs for a more effective monitoring of these emerging contaminants in the plants and soil continuum. It was found that the PPCPs have a very high potential interactive capacity, having interacted with all the studied metals, and metalloids, as well as with plant macro elements (P, and K). The uptake of PPCPs by plants was statistically significantly related with their respective content in the soil. The general inference is that the interactive relations between heavy metals, macro-, microelements, and emerging contaminants, being mainly antagonistic, which contribute to the decrease the uptake of soil PPCPs.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes in presence of UV light are successful to obtain complete mineralization of various pharmaceutical pollutants but no one has studied the photocatalytic removal of spiramycin under visible light irradiation. In this work, N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst active under visible light was used to evaluate the photodegradation of this antibiotic. Photocatalytic tests were carried out in a slurry photoreactor irradiated both with UV Black Light Tube and blue LEDs with spectrum emission in the visible region. Reaction products were monitored both in liquid-phase, by TOC analysis, and in gas-phase, by continuous analyzers, measuring CO and CO2 gaseous concentrations at the photoreactor outlet. The only product detected in gas-phase during UV and visible light irradiation was CO2, confirming that the photocatalytic process has been proven effective in the mineralization process of spiramycin, reaching very high values of TOC removal. A detailed mathematical modelling was performed, estimating a single value of reaction constant, able to predict the behavior of mineralization also for different initial concentrations of antibiotic. The system was effective in the removal of organic compounds present in a real pharmaceutical wastewater reaching high values of depollution in short times. It has been demonstrates the feasibility of photocatalytic visible treatment of streams containing spiramycin with N-doped TiO2, yielding in a promising method for wastewater treatment.

AB In this study, UV based treatments were implemented at pilot scale to assess their ability to remove hormones from treated wastewater, especially with the view to equip small and medium size Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs). To this end, the degradation of a mixture of estrogenic hormones (Estrone (E1), beta-Estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-Ethinyl Estradiol (EE2)) in waters by UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 process was investigated in real conditions. A particular attention was paid at designing a well validated laboratory scale pilot in order to optimise oxidant concentrations and UV fluence. A Low pressure lamp (254 nm) was used in a flow through commercial reactor. The effects of water matrices (drinking water and treated wastewater) and H2O2 concentrations (10, 40, and 90 mg/L) on the pilot efficiency were first determined. Only E1 could be partially degraded by UV photolysis whereas hormones were all well removed by UV/H2O2 process in both matrices. The second part of the study focused on a chemical and biological assessment of UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 process (30 and 50 mg/L). Degradation rate constants of hormones as well as changes in estrogenic activity (YES bioassay) and toxicity (Vibrio fischeri) were followed at the same time. UV photolysis could not remove neither estrogens nor estrogenic activity at relevant UV fluence in waters. However 80% of initial estrogenic compounds and estrogenic activity could be removed from treated wastewater by combining UV fluence of 423 and 520 mJ/cm(2) with 50 and 30 mg/L of H2O2, respectively. No high estrogenic or toxic by-products were detected by the two bioassays following UV photolysis or UV/H2O2 process. Operating costs were estimated for a full scale pilot. H2O2 was the major cost. By combining the appropriate concentration of H2O2 and UV fluence, it could be possible to design a cost effective treatment for treating estrogens in small and medium size WTPs.

AB Prevalent findings of anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) residues in liver tissue of freshwater fish recently emphasized the existence of aquatic exposure pathways. Thus, a comprehensive wastewater treatment plant and surface water monitoring campaign was conducted at two urban catchments in Germany in 2018 and 2019 to investigate potential emission sources of ARs into the aquatic environment. Over several months, the occurrence and fate of all eight ARs authorized in the European Union as well as two pharmaceutical anticoagulants was monitored in a variety of aqueous, solid, and biological environmental matrices during and after widespread sewer baiting with AR-containing bait. As a result, sewer baiting in combined sewer systems, besides outdoor rodent control at the surface, was identified as a substantial contributor of these biocidal active ingredients in the aquatic environment. In conjunction with heavy or prolonged precipitation during bait application in combined sewer systems, a direct link between sewer baiting and AR residues in wastewater treatment plant influent, effluent, and the liver of freshwater fish was established. Moreover, study results confirmed insufficient removal of anticoagulants during conventional wastewater treatment and thus indirect exposure of aquatic organisms in receiving streams via tertiary treated effluents and combined sewer overflows. Nevertheless, further research is required to determine the ecological implications and risks for aquatic organisms as well as fish-eating predators from chronic AR exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB This study focused on the occurrence and fate of four beta-blockers (atenolol, sotalol, metoprolol, propranolol) in wastewater and surface water. Measured concentrations were compared with predicted concentrations using an implementation of the geo-referenced model GREAT-ER for the Glatt Valley Watershed (Switzerland). Particularly, the question was addressed how measured and simulated data could complement each other for the exposure assessment of human pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants entering surface water through wastewater treatment plants (WWTP).
   Concentrations in the Glatt River ranged from < LOQ to 83 ng L-1 with the highest concentrations found for atenolol. Higher loads were measured on days with combined sewer over-flow events during high flow conditions.
   GREAT-ER was able to predict spatially resolved river concentrations based, on average consumption and excretion data, removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and dissipation and degradation processes in surface water within a factor of 2. These results indicate that modelling might be sufficient to estimate daily average exposure concentrations for compounds that are either recalcitrant or whose degradation and sorption behaviour can be predicted with confidence based on laboratory experiments. Chemical measurements, in contrast, should be reserved for assessing point sources, investigating mechanisms which lead to short-term temporal fluctuations in compound loads, and deter-mining in-situ degradation rates in conjunction with modelling.

AB Due to the high consumption and incorrect disposal of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), they are recognized as contaminants of emerging concern. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may be inefficient in removing PhACs, therefore discharging them into surface waters. The removal efficiencies of five WWTPs located in the south of Portugal (Alentejo) were evaluated in 2020. Twenty-six PhACs were analyzed in wastewater influents, effluents, and surface waters, upstream and downstream of the WWTPs by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detection (UPLC-MS/MS). The most representative PhACs in influents were acetaminophen, caffeine, naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac with minimum-maximum concentrations of 49-225 mu g/L, 26-46 mu g/L, 5.9-13 mu g/L, 5.2-22 mu g/L, and 1.3-2.5 mu g/L, respectively. For effluents, it was acetaminophen, caffeine, and diclofenac with minimum-maximum concentrations of 0.054-7.8 mu g/L, 0.084-4.8 mu g/L, and 0.28-3.3 mu g/L, respectively. The highest removal efficiencies were observed for acetaminophen, sulfadiazine, cortisone, testosterone, metoprolol, and propranolol (100%). The lowest removal efficiencies were observed for carbamazepine (2.7%) and diclofenac (-13.2%). The risk quotient of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac were higher than 1 for receiving waters, indicating they probably pose high risks to aquatic organisms.

AB In this study, a control anaerobic membrane bioreactor (C-AnMBR) and a bioaugmented anaerobic membrane bioreactor (B-AnMBR) were operated for 210 d to treat pharmaceutical wastewater. Both the bioreactors were fed with the pharmaceutical wastewater containing TCOD of 16,249 +/- 714 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 29,450 +/- 2209 mg/L with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 13.0 +/- 0.6 kgCOD/m(3)d. Under steady-state condition, an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 46.1 +/- 2.9% and 60.3 +/- 2.8% was achieved by the C-AnMBR and the B-AnMBR, respectively. The conventional anaerobes in the C-AnMBR cannot tolerate the hypersaline conditions well, resulting in lower TCOD removal efficiency, biogas production and methane yield than the B-AnMBR seeded from the coastal shore. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that marine bacterial species (Oliephilus sp.) and halophilic bacterial species (Therrnohalobacter sp.) were only present in the B-AnMBR; these species could possibly degrade complex and recalcitrant organic matter and withstand hypersaline environments. Two different dominant archaeal communities, genus Methanosaeta (43.4%) and Methanolobus (61.7%), were identified as the dominant methanogens in the C-AnMBR and the B-AnMBR, respectively. The species of genus Methanolobus was reported resistant to penicillin and required sodium and magnesium for growth, which could enable it to thrive in the hypersaline environment.

AB The presence of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment and their potential effects on living organisms has become an issue of growing concern. Among emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals may enter the aquatic environment due to their high consumption and their incomplete removal in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
   The main goal of this study was the assessment of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals found in municipal wastewater of a coastal WWTP (Castell-Platja d'Aro, Spain) using an integrated pilot scale membrane system (MBR-RO).
   Twenty multiple-class pharmaceuticals (including psychiatric drugs, macrolide antibiotics, beta-blockers, sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, histamine H-2 receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatories, nitroimidazole, beta-agonist and antiplatelet agent) were measured in real influent with the lowest average concentration for psychiatric drugs (0.017 mu g L-1) to the highest for macrolide antibiotics (2.02 mu g L-1). Although some contaminants were in relatively high concentrations (even up to 2.90 mu g L-1 in the case of ofloxacin).
   The combination of MBR and RO treatment showed excellent overall removal of target emerging contaminants with removal rates above 99% for all of them. For some compounds (metronidazole, hydrocodone, codein, ranitidine) MBR provided high removal efficiency (up to 95%). Additionally RO membrane showed removal rates always higher than 99%.

AB We studied the toxicological interaction of 46 micropollutants from a biologically treated wastewater effluent in mixtures with silica, amine-modified silica, titanium dioxide and magnetite nanoparticles. The pollutants tracked in this work were polar pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic groups, some of their metabolites and artificial sweeteners, the concentrations of which were mostly in the tens to hundreds of ng L-1 range. The results showed particularly high adsorption for furosemide, gemfibrozil and the aminopyrine metabolite 4FAA. There was preferential adsorption of the less polar compounds on the less polar nanoparticles. The total amounts of compounds adsorbed and quantified were 13.4, 4.8, 10.8 and 7.1 mu g g(-1) for SiO2, SiO2-NH2, TiO2 and Fe3O4, respectively. The toxicity of wastewater-nanoparticle mixtures was assessed using the bioluminescent cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 CPB4337. The interactions were quantified by means of the combination index (CI)-isobologram method. The binary mixtures of wastewater with SiO2, SiO2-NH2 and TiO2 displayed antagonism for the lower affected fractions, which corresponded to the lower concentrations. For higher effects and for the Fe3O4 nanoparticles over the whole tested range, the mixtures were additive leading to synergism for the higher affected fractions. No internalization was observed. The results showed that the reduced toxicant bioavailability due to the interaction with nanoparticles is relevant for micropollutants at environmental concentrations. The amount of anthropogenic pollutants retained by metal oxide nanoparticles has significant toxicological effects.

AB A heterogeneous advanced Fenton process (AFP) based on the use of zero valent iron (ZVI) has been investigated for the treatment of a real industrial wastewater, generated from a drug manufacturing plant. The effluent consists of a complex mixture of organic substances which are refractory to conventional treatments. The concentration of ZVI and oxidant (H2O2) were studied. The use of moderate concentrations of oxidant and ZVI commercial catalyst led to total organic carbon (TOC) reductions of 70% and 55% of diluted (TOC0 0.1 g L-1) and as-received pharmaceutical wastewater (TOC0 5 g L-1), respectively, with a remarkable enhancement of the biodegradability in all cases. Apart from that, it was demonstrated a notable effect of the magnetic agitation system (speed and size of the stir bar) on the catalytic performance of the ZVI/H2O2 system. The aggregation of ZVI particles on the magnetic stir bar surface, due to its intrinsic magnetic properties makes that the availability of active ZVI particles was somewhat controlled by the size of the magnetic stir bar. For the best operation conditions, a higher TOC conversion was accomplished during the first minutes of reaction, slowing down afterwards, probably due to passivation of the ZVI catalyst.

AB Indiscriminate consumption of antibiotics, their discharge into the environment, and the development of resistant genes in a natural ecosystem are ever-increasing global threats. Metronidazole is applied to treat infection diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. In this research, TiO2/Fe+3 was used as a heterogeneous nano-photocatalyst for the degradation of metronidazole with UV-C radiation as the energy source. Parameters tested in the removal process were pH=3, 7, and 11; antibiotic concentration of 80mg/L; contact times of 30, 60, 90, and 120min; and nano-photocatalyst of TiO2/Fe+3 with concentrations of 30, 60, 90, 250, 500, 750, and 1000mg/L. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics of metronidazole was studied. Optimal conditions were achieved on synthetic solutions; then, all experiments were performed on wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using an HPLC device. All tests were replicated three times according to the standard methods of water and wastewater experiments, the 20th edition. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 and the statistical test ANOVA. The optimal conditions for removing metronidazole from synthetic solution included, 500 mg/L for nano-photocatalyst concentration, pH=11 and 120min contact time. Removal efficiency of antibiotic under optimal conditions was 97% from synthetic solutions and 69.85% from pharmaceutical wastewater. Finally, Fe+3-TiO2/UV-C were identified as a promising technique for the removal of metronidazole with high efficiency from aqueous solutions.

AB Today, the presence of contaminants in the environment is a topic of interest for society in general and for the scientific community in particular. A very large amount of different chemical substances reaches the environment after passing through wastewater treatment plants without being eliminated. This is due to the inefficiency of conventional removal processes and the lack of government regulations. The list of compounds entering treatment plants is gradually becoming longer and more varied because most of these compounds come from pharmaceuticals, hormones or personal care products, which are increasingly used by modern society. As a result of this increase in compound variety, to address these emerging pollutants, the development of new and more efficient removal technologies is needed. Different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially photochemical AOPs, have been proposed as supplements to traditional treatments for the elimination of pollutants, showing significant advantages over the use of conventional methods alone. This work aims to review the analytical methodologies employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater in studies in which advanced oxidation processes are applied. Due to the low concentrations of these substances in wastewater, mass spectrometry detectors are usually chosen to meet the low detection limits and identification power required. Specifically, time-of-flight detectors are required to analyse the by-products.

AB The first part of our study is focused on the analysis of wastewaters composition from the effluence of four Slovak and three Czech wastewater treatment plants. The presence of 30 psychoactive substances and their main metabolites, antibiotic resistant coliforms and S. aureus were determined. The highest concentrations were observed in the case of cotinine, methamphetamine, tramadol, venlafaxine, and oxazepam. The amount of coliforms ranged from 0.6 to 2.7 log CFU/cm(3). The majority of them showed ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. The amount of S. aureus ranged from 0.3 to 2.7 log CFU/cm(3) with methicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin resistance. The second part of this study was focused on the treatment of respective wastewaters by anodic oxidation of contaminants by boron doped diamond electrodes, which were tested applying various current intensities (12.50, 18.75, 40.00 mA/cm(2)). Obtained results indicate that this method is able to effectively degrade a wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals and drugs that are insufficiently removed by traditional processes at wastewater treatment plants, such as oxazepam, venlafaxine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, cotinine, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, and citalopram with the efficiency more than 50%. Moreover, the only 1 h lasting treatment caused the elimination of the total bacteria count including the resistant types under the detection limit.

AB Aerated batch reactors (2.5 L) fed either with urban or synthetic wastewater were inoculated with microalgae (dominated by Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) to remove caffeine, ibuprofen, galaxolide, tributyl phosphate, 4-octylphenol, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and carbamazepine for 10 incubation days. Non-aerated and darkness reactors were used as controls. Microalgae grew at a rate of 0.25 d(-1) with the complete removal of N-NH4 during the course of the experiment. After 10 incubation days, up to 99% of the microcontaminants with a Henry's law constant higher than 3 10(-1) Pa m(3) mol(-1) (i.e., 4-octylphenol, galaxolide, and tributyl phosphate) were removed by volatilization due to the effect of air stripping. Whereas biodegradation was effective for removing ibuprofen and caffeine, carbamazepine and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate behaved as recalcitrant compounds. The use of microalgae was proved to be relevant for increasing the biodegradation removal efficiency of ibuprofen by 40% and reducing the lag phase of caffeine by 3 days. Moreover, the enantioselective biodegradation of S-ibuprofen suggested a biotic prevalent removal process, which was supported by the identification of carboxy-ibuprofen and hydroxy-ibuprofen. The results from microalgae reactors fed with synthetic wastewater showed no clear evidences of microalgae uptake of any of the studied microcontaminants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) is the most critical intermediate for cephalosporin antibiotics but has caused serious water pollution. In this study, a bench-scale test was conducted with a novel multi-stage loop membrane bioreactor (MsLMBR) to treat chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing 7-ACA.
   RESULTSThe MsLMBR system comprised a multi-stage loop aerobic reactor and a separate membrane module operated at different temperatures. Results showed that for MsLMBR1 at 15 degrees C, MsLMBR2 at 25 degrees C and MsLMBR3 at 35 degrees C, the average total chemical oxygen demands (TCODs) of the effluent were all less than 80 mg L-1. For MsLMBR2 and MsLMBR3, the microorganisms had better microbial activities and drug-resistances, and the biological removal was given priority to TCOD removal. But for MsLMBR1, there was no significant difference between biological removal and physical removal at the early stage. Average 7-ACA concentration of effluent was less than 40 mg L-1 at 35 degrees C. The laboratory data fitted the simulated data well using a time series analysis model (TSAM) in a MsLMBR system.
   CONCLUSION7-ACA pharmaceutical wastewater was effectively treated in a MsLMBR system, which also performed well at low temperature. In addition, the TSAM was a valid means to simulate and predict the efficiency of removal of an organic substance. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This study describes a multidisciplinary approach that investigates the breakdown potential of a laccase mediated system from Trametes pubescens MUT 2400 against several micropollutants including already recognized endocrine disrupting chemicals at their natural residual concentrations (from mu g/L up to ng/L).
   In model solution, the chemical speciation focused on a mixture of 18 analytes and adopted stir bar sorptive extraction with directed in-situ derivatization followed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis. The method's key performance parameters were evaluated in consideration of the chemical peculiarities and complexity of real wastewaters: precision, accuracy, estimated working range extended to a wide residual concentration interval (10 ng/L to100 mu g/L) indicated its fitness for purpose.
   Laccases were extremely active towards all the target compounds, both in term of removal yields and rate. The maximal percentage of removal was obtained for 4-t-butylphenol, 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 4-n-octylphenol, salicylic acid and estrone (percentage of removal above 90%). Enzymes concentration played a central role and in most of the cases, the catalyzed reactions were very fast: the initial concentration of 9 compounds was halved within the first 3 h.
   The laccase-mediated treatment was then applied to a municipal wastewater collected in a real wastewater treatment plant, containing at least 9 xenobiotics as drugs, pesticides, plasticizers and personal care products. Although the harsh chemical and biological conditions of the effluent influenced enzyme stability, the reaction took place, and above 70% transformation was obtained for most analytes during the 24 h experiment. Bioassays were carried out to estimate the estrogenic activity (the E-screen test and the MELN gene-reporter luciferase assay) and the ecotoxicity (Lepidium sativum, Pseudo-kirchneriella subcapitata and Vibrio fischeri), demonstrating the capability of laccases to mediate an effective detoxification of the wastewater and a decrease of the estrogenic activity.

AB The behaviour of nine pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) of different diagnostic groups is studied during a nitrifying-denitrifying process in an activated sludge system. The compounds selected cover a wide range of frequently used substances such as anti-epileptics (carbamazepine), tranquillisers (diazepam), anti-depressants (fluoxetine and citalopram), anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac) and estrogens (estradiol and ethinylestradiol). The main objective of this research is to investigate the effect of acclimation of biomass on the removal rates of these compounds, either by maintaining a high sludge retention time or at long-term operation. The removal rates achieved for nitrogen and carbon in the experimental unit exceed 90% and were not affected by the addition of PhACs. Carbamazepine, diazepam and diclofenac were only removed to a small extent. On the other hand, higher removal rates have been observed for naproxen and ibuprofen (68% and 82%), respectively.

AB Extracts of copoazu (Theobroma gramdiflorum), canangucha (Maurita Flexuosa), and coffee (Coffea arabica) were explored as enhancers of the solar photo-Fenton process to eliminate acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, and diclofenac in raw municipal wastewater. The process, at pH 6.2 and 5 mg L-1 of iron without the presence of extracts, had a very limited action (similar to 35% of the pollutants degradation at 90 min of treatment) due to the iron precipitation. Interestingly, the extract addition increased the soluble iron forms, but only copoazu extract improved the pollutant degradation (similar to 95% of elimination at 20 min of the process action). The copoazu extract components acted as natural complexing agents, maintaining the soluble iron up to 2 mg L-1 even after 90 min and, consequently, enhancing the pollutant degradation. The effect of copoazu extract dose on the process performance was also assessed, finding that an iron:polyphenols (from the copoazu extract) at a molar ratio equal to 1:0.16 was the most favorable condition. Then, the process improved by copoazu extract was applied to raw municipal wastewater. Remarkably, the process led to similar to 90% of total pharmaceuticals degradation at 20 min of treatment. This work evidenced the feasibility of amazonian fruit extracts to improve the solar photo-Fenton process to degrade pharmaceuticals in aqueous matrices at near-neutral pH.

AB The effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants is a major point source of contamination in Canadian waterways. The improvement of effluent quality to reduce contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, before being released into the environment is necessary to reduce the impacts on organisms that live in the river downstream. Here, we aimed to characterize the metabolic and gill physiological responses of rainbow (Etheostoma caeruleum), fantail (Etheostoma flabellare), and greenside (Etheostoma blennioides) darters to the effluent in the Grand River from the recently upgraded Waterloo municipal wastewater treatment plant. The routine metabolism of darters was not affected by effluent exposure, but some species had increased maximum metabolic rates, leading to an increased aerobic scope. The rainbow darter aerobic scope increased by 2.2 times and the fantail darter aerobic scope increased by 2.7 times compared to the reference site. Gill samples from effluent-exposed rainbow darters and greenside darters showed evidence of more pathologies and variations in morphology. These results suggest that darters can metabolically adjust to effluent-contaminated water and may also be adapting to the urban and agricultural inputs. The modification and damage to the gills provide a useful water quality indicator but does not necessarily reflect how well acclimated the species is to the environment due to a lack of evidence of poor fish health.

AB TiO2-supported chitosan scaffolds (TiO2/CS) are here proposed as promising material for wastewater treatment, in particular for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. TiO2/CS are tested for the amoxicillin photodegradation under UV/Vis irradiation. Amoxicillin (AMX) is an antibiotic of the betalactam family. Due to the release of antibiotics in wastewater and their persistence in the environment, harmful effects can develop on the aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   TiO2 chitosan scaffolds with photocatalytic activity for wastewater remediation have been prepared by 3D printing using commercial P25-TiO2. The formulation for the 3D printer was prepared by dispersion of chitosan and TiO2 in powder form at the concentration 6% w/v and 1% w/v, respectively. The TiO2 particles (crystalline anatase and rutile phases) embedded in the chitosan have a size of about 20 nm, like in the starting material, as verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and are homogeneously distributed in the scaffold, also after repeated photocatalytic tests, as revealed by SEM-EDS.
   The mechanical properties of the 3D structures are suitable for the targeted application as they can be easily handled without breakage.
   The AMX photodegradation efficiency under light irradiation by TiO2/CS made with scaffolds of different thicknesses (3, 5,15 layers), was assessed in water by means of UV-Vis absorption and HPLC/UV measurements, at two different AMX:TiO2 molar ratios: 1/100 and 1/10. The 3D printed TiO2/CS system, even after repeated cycles, shows a high photodegradation efficiency, compared to the direct AMX photolysis. A zero-order kinetics for TiO2 supported photodegradation was found, whereas a pseudo-first order was observed for water dispersed TiO2.
   Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of AMX degradates such as penilloic and penicilloic acids and diketopiperazine.
   The proposed 3D printed chitosan scaffolds may be used as reusable substrate for the TiO2 photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) is really important to minimize the risk for human health and environment. In this study, the homogeneous advanced oxidation process (AOP) UV-C/free chlorine (UV-C/FC) was investigated at pilot scale in the degradation of a mixture of four CECs, in different water matrices and compared to a consolidated AOP, namely UV-C/H2O2. As matter of fact 90% degradation of CECs was observed after 15 min (O-UVC = 033 kJ L-1) by UV-C/FC (5 mg L-1 of FC) and 30 min (0.67 kJ L-1) by UV-C/H2O2 (5 mg L-1 of H2O2) in natural water. However, CECs degradation by UV-C/H2O2 and UV-C/FC was comparable (>82%) in wastewater samples, under the investigated conditions (60 min, 1.33 kJ L-1). The effect of sunlight/FC process on the target CECs was also investigated (in a compound parabolic collector based reactor). Interestingly, a different behaviour was observed between the two light sources. In particular, a total removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) and imidacloprid (IMD) was observed for UV-C/FC process with 0.27 kJ L-1 and 10 mgL(-1) of FC, while, in the sunlight/FC process (same FC dose), CBZ total removal took place quite fast (0.50 kJ L-1), but 90% removal of IMD was observed only after 60 min (7.09 kJ L-1). In conclusion, UV-C/FC process can be an interesting solution for tertiary treatment of urban wastewater for the removal of CECs and sunlight/FC is worthy of further investigation to evaluate its possible application in small UWTPs.

AB The present work describes the first known study to date on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water and wastewater of Cuernavaca, the capital of the state of Morelos (Mexico). Selected pharmaceuticals (a total of 35) were extracted fromthe collected water samples with a generic solid phase extraction (SPE) protocol and determined in the sample extracts by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-tandemmass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A screening level risk assessment combining the measured environmental concentrations (MECs) with dose-response data based on predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) was also applied to estimate Hazard Quotients (HQs) for the pharmaceuticals detected in the investigated area. A total of twelve pharmaceuticals were found in the water samples analyzed, with detection frequencies above 78% and in most cases of 100%. Overall, the most abundant pharmaceuticals in surface water were the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs naproxen (732-4880 ng/L), acetaminophen (354-4460 ng/L), and diclofenac (258-1398 ng/L), and the lipid regulator bezafibrate (286-2100 ng/L). On the contrary, other compounds like the beta-blocker atenolol and the psychiatric drug carbamazepine were found at only a few ng or tens of ng per liter in the Apatlaco River. Despite the fact that some of the most abundant compounds showed good removal (> 97%) during wastewater treatment, concentrations downstream the WWTP were only slightly lower than upstream. This indicates the existence of additional inputs of untreated wastewater into the river. Based on the obtained HQ-values, the concentrations of ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and naproxen present in the river could pose a high toxicity risk for the aquatic ecosystem. These findings highlight these pharmaceuticals as relevant organic contaminants in the area of study and the need to further monitor them in order to adopt appropriate measures to safeguard the ecosystem, and eventually human health.

AB The electrochemical degradation of tetracaine hydrochloride has been studied in urban wastewater. Treatments in simulated matrix with similar ionic composition as well as in 0.050 M Na2SO4 were comparatively performed. The cell contained an air-diffusion cathode for H2O2 electrogeneration and an anode selected among active Pt, IrO2-based and RuO2-based materials and non-active boron-doped diamond (BDD). Electrochemical oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (EO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) were comparatively assessed at pH 3.0 and constant current density. The pharmaceutical and its byproducts were oxidized by center dot OH formed from water oxidation at the anode surface and in the bulk from Fenton's reaction, which occurred upon addition of 0.50 mM Fe2+ in all media, along with active chlorine originated from the anodic oxidation of Cl- contained in the simulated matrix and urban wastewater. The PEF process was the most powerful treatment regardless of the electrolyte composition, owing to the additional photolysis of intermediates by UVA radiation. The use of BDD led to greater mineralization compared to other anodes, being feasible the total removal of all organics from urban wastewater by PEE at long electrolysis time. Chlorinated products were largely recalcitrant when Pt, IrO2-based or RuO2-based anodes were used, whereas they were effectively destroyed by BDD(center dot OH). Tetracaine decay always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics, being slightly faster with the RuO2-based anode in Cl- media because of the higher amounts of active chlorine produced. Total nitrogen and concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, ClO3-, Clog and active chlorine were determined to clarify the behavior of the different electrodes in PEF. Eight intermediates were identified by GC-MS and fumaric and oxalic acids were quantified as final carboxylic acids by ion-exclusion HPLC, allowing the proposal of a plausible reaction sequence for tetracaine mineralization by PEF in Cl--containing medium.

AB The performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) in the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) is generally evaluated on the basis of chemical analysis. In this work, we used a combination of chemical, toxicological, and molecular analyses to assess the attenuation of PhACs, toxic potency and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a field study of three CWs serving as tertiary treatment of wastewater treatment plants. First, 17 PhACs were analysed chemically, of which 14 were detected and seven at concentrations >0.1 mu g/l. Even though some of the individual PhACs were moderately or highly removed in the CWs investigated, median removal of overall PhACs was approximately 50% in the vertical subsurface flow CW (VSF-CW) with a lower hydraulic loading rate while the removal in the other two free water surface flow CWs (SF-CWs) was negligible. Second, toxic potency of wastewater extracts was assessed in a range of bioassays. Estrogenicity was overall attenuated in CWs, while the neurotoxic potency of wastewater extracts did not decrease after passage through the two CWs investigated. Third, the VSF-CW and one of the SF-CW showed a positive removal of an integrase gene and three ARGs tested. The increased concentrations of ARGs in the other SF-CW, as well as the increase of total bacteria in all CWs, may relate to regrowth of resistance-carrying bacteria. Finally, multivariate analysis shows that most PhACs are positively correlated to the observed toxic potency. Additionally, low removal of organics and nutrients seems to parallel with low removal of PhACs. ARGs positively correlated with organics, nutrients and some PhACs, and the integrase gene but not to the respective antibiotics. The insufficient removal of PhACs, toxic po- tency, and ARGs indicates the need of an optimal design of CWs as tertiary treatment facilities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals have become an important public health issue as environmental pollutants over the last years. After ingestion, pharmaceuticals are partly excreted unchanged. They can reach the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) via the sewer network. Because the conventional treatments are ineffective in their removal, new methods should be approached, for example semiconductor photocatalysis. Several of the hitherto published studies analyzed the degradation of model pollutants but for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in unspiked real wastewater further investigations are required. Therefore, we want to focus on the removal of pharmaceuticals in an actual effluent from a WWTP and investigate the effluent background effect. This study shows the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of 14 pharmaceuticals with initial concentrations C-i > 0.3 mu g L (1) present in a WWTP effluent. We found that UVA (1.5 mW cm (2), intensity peak at 365 nm) irradiation of TiO2 P25 (A(s) = 56 m(2) g (1)) or ZnO (A(s) = 5.23 m(2) g (1)) nanoparticles leads to considerable degradation of the analyzed pharmaceuticals. With ZnO nanoparticles, 40 min UVA irradiation was sufficient to degrade over 95% of these pharmaceuticals (k(app) = 8.6 x 10 (2) s (1)). Using TiO2 P25 on the other hand, it would take more than six times longer to reach the same level (k(app) = 1.4 x 10 (2) s (1)). Carbamazepine dissolved in millipore water served as a comparison model. Also in this system ZnO presents faster degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The widespread utilization of organic compounds in modern society and their dispersion through wastewater have resulted in extensive contamination of source and drinking waters. The vast majority of these compounds are not regulated in wastewater outfalls or in drinking water while trace amounts of certain compounds can impact aquatic wildlife. Hence it is prudent to monitor these contaminants in water sources until sufficient toxicological data relevant to humans becomes available. A method was developed for the analysis of 36 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroid hormones (androgens, progestins, and glucocorticoids), personal care products and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs) using a single solid phase extraction (SPE) technique with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method was applied to a variety of water matrices to demonstrate method performance and reliability.
   Results: UHPLC-MS/MS in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes was employed to achieve optimum sensitivity while reducing sample analysis time (<20 min) compared with previously published methods. The detection limits for most compounds was lower than 1.0 picogram on the column while reporting limits in water ranged from 0.1 to 15 ng/L based on the extraction of a 1 L sample and concentration to 1 mL. Recoveries in ultrapure water for most compounds were between 90-110%, while recoveries in surface water and wastewater were in the range of 39-121% and 38-141% respectively. The analytical method was successfully applied to analyze samples across several different water matrices including wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water at different stages of the treatment. Among several compounds detected in wastewater, sucralose and TCPP showed the highest concentrations.
   Conclusion: The proposed method is sensitive, rapid and robust; hence it can be used to analyze a large variety of trace organic compounds in different water matrixes.

AB Antidepressants are among the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. As they modulate neurotransmission in nervous systems, behavioural abnormalities among aquatic species are of concern. It is possible to measure the concentrations of selected antidepressants by chemical analysis, but other non-target antidepressants and active metabolites might also be present. Here, we propose an "in vitro monoamine transporter inhibition assay" to measure the biological activity of antidepressants, particularly monoamine transporter inhibitors, in wastewater. We used APP, a fluorescent substrate for monoamine transporters, to measure the activity of wastewater extracts at inhibiting APP uptake through the human serotonin transporter (hSERT), norepinephrine transporter (hNET), and dopamine transporter, and the zebrafish SERT (zSERT). We confirmed that the assay could measure the biological activity of test antidepressants. Interestingly, the IC50 values of antidepressants (the concentration that gave a 50% reduction of APP uptake) for the zSERT were smaller than those for the hSERT. For example, IC50 value of desipramine for the zSERT was 1/200 of that for the hSERT. These results indicate that antidepressants inhibited zSERT more strongly than hSERT. Then we applied the assay to extracts of effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants and detected biological activity of antidepressants specifically against the hSERT, hNET, and zSERT for the first time. For the hSERT, antidepressant-equivalent quantities (EQs) ranged from 2.2 x 10(1) to 2.5 x 10(2) ng-clomipramine-EQ/L. For the hNET, EQs ranged from below limit of detection to 8.2 x 10(1) ng-desipramine-EQ/L. For the zSERT, EQs ranged from 2.8 x 10(2) to 3.3 x 10(2) ngduloxetine-EQ/L. The in vitro monoamine transporter inhibition assay is thus useful for measuring the biological activity of antidepressants in the aquatic environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ambient temperature is known to have impact on population health but assessing its impact by the traditional cohort approach is resource intensive. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) could be an alternative for the traditional approach. This study was to provide the first evaluation to see if WBE can be used to assess the impact of temperature exposure to a population in South East Queensland, Australia using selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as biomarkers. Daily loads of eight PPCPs in wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment plant were measured from February 2011 to June 2012. Corresponding daily weather data were obtained from the closest weather station. Missing data of PPCPs were handled using the multiple imputation (MI) method, then we used a one-way between-groups analysis of variance to examine the seasonal effect on daily variation of PPCP5 by seasons. Finally, an MI estimate was performed to evaluate the continuous relationship between daily average temperature and each multiply-imputed PPCP using time-series regression analysis. The results indicated that an increase of 1 C in average temperature associated with decrease at 1.3 g/d (95% CI: -2.2 to ( -0.4), p < 0.05) for atenolol, increase at 36.5 g/d (95% CI: 25.2-47.8, p < 0.01) for acesulfame, and increase at 0.8 g/d (95% CI: 0.02-1.55, p = 0.05) for naproxen. No significant association was observed between temperature and the remaining PPCP5, comprising: caffeine, carbamazepine, codeine, hydrochlorothiazide, and salicylic acid. The findings suggested that consumption of sweetened drinks, risk of worsening cardiovascular conditions and pains are associated with variation in ambient temperature. WBE can thus be used as a complementary method to traditional cohort studies in epidemiological evaluation of the association between environmental factors and health outcomes provided that specific biomarkers of such health outcomes can be identified.

AB In this study, the performance and removal mechanisms of a novel lab-scale multiple draft tubes airlift loop membrane bioreactor (Mt-ALMBR) for treating high-strength ampicillin pharmaceutical wastewater under different temperatures (7 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 48 degrees C) were investigated. During 150 days operation, the optimal average chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ampicillin removal rates were 98.2 +/- 0.2% (36 degrees C) and 63.2 +/- 5.6% (7 degrees C), respectively. The main mechanisms of pollutants removal were membrane removal (7 similar to 16 degrees C) and bioreactor removal (16 - 48 degrees C). Adsorption and membrane rejection were main pathways at low temperature, as temperature increased, hydrolysis and biodegradation gradually occupied a dominant position. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature ranges for activated sludge microorganisms were 16 degrees C similar to 36 degrees C, the corresponding beta-lactamase at 36 degrees C was the highest activity value among all the set temperature values. Experimental results showed that temperature had a significant impact on the removal rate, the optimum temperature range was proposed to be at 24 similar to 36 degrees C. The half-life (t(1/2)) of ampicillin drastically decreased from 330.0 d to 2.1 d when the temperature was increased from 7 degrees C to 48 degrees C. And the maximum adsorption capacity K-f at the adsorption temperatures of 7, 16, 24, 36 and 48 degrees C was 0.1284, 0.2169, 0.0645, 0.1502 and 0.1524 mg/g, respectively. The values of Delta G degrees were all negative, proving that the adsorption process of the ampicillin belonged to a spontaneous physical adsorption. In addition, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and mathematical fitting models were developed and well simulated the performance of Mt-ALMBR to treat the ampicillin wastewater. These results suggest that Mt-ALMBR holds great potential for application in ampicillin pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Among all the pharmaceutical drugs that contaminate the environment, antibiotics occupy an important place due to their high consumption rates in both veterinary and human medicine. The present study examined the ability of Pseudomonas putida to grow on the antibiotic wastewater, currently expanding in Tunisia, containing amoxicillin and cefadroxil. P. putida was very efficient to grow quickly in pharmaceutical wastewater (PW) and in reducing the total dissolved solids to 80.1 %. Cytotoxicity of PW, before and after biodegradation with P. putida mt-2, was evaluated in vitro, using the MTT assay, against four human tumor cell lines such as A549 (lung cell carcinoma), HCT15 (colon cell carcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and U373 (glioma cell carcinoma). The PW reduced all human cell lines viability in a dose-dependent manner. This activity was very remarkable against U373 cell line. For this reason, we have tested the genotoxicity of PW using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation. In fact, PW has statistically significant (p < 0.001) influence on DNA. Indeed, the percentage of genotoxicity was 66.87 and 87.5 %, after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively. However, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity decreased strongly when tested the PW obtained after incubation with P. putida mt-2. Our results indicate that P. putida is a promising and improved alternative to treating industrial-scale effluent compared to current chemical treatment procedures used by the industrials.

AB Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug frequently detected in the influent and effluent of sewage treatment plants. The Gram-positive strain Planococcus sp. S5 was able to remove approximately 30 % of naproxen after 35 days of incubation in monosubstrate culture. Under cometabolic conditions, with glucose or phenol as a growth substrate, the degradation efficiency of S5 increased. During 35 days of incubation, 75.14 +/- 1.71 % and 86.27 +/- 2.09 % of naproxen was degraded in the presence of glucose and phenol, respectively. The highest rate of naproxen degradation observed in the presence of phenol may be connected with the fact that phenol is known to induce enzymes responsible for aromatic ring cleavage. The activity of phenol monooxygenase, naphthalene monooxygenase, and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase was indicated in Planococcus sp. S5 culture with glucose or phenol as a growth substrate. It is suggested that these enzymes may be engaged in naproxen degradation.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical and steroid compounds in groundwater due to wastewater reuse has been reported and is of concern in tropical islands which primarily rely on groundwater. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and removal of 43 pharmaceutical and steroid compounds detected in wastewater at four different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Hawaii and to understand their environmental behavior through tropical soils as the treated effluents are used in landscapes for irrigation. Eight soil sampling locations, collected at three different depths, representing the most common soil types in Hawaii and four WWTPs located across the major Hawaiian Islands were used. Disturbed soil samples were used to conduct the soil sorption and degradation studies and to estimate the leaching risk associated to the identified compounds. Quantification of selected compounds was conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
   Among the investigated compounds, only ten were detected in the treated effluents at concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 0.900 mu g L-1. Caffeine (64 mu g L-1) and ibuprofen (96.5 mu g L-1) showed the highest concentration in raw samples, while diphenhydramine (0.9 mu g L-1) showed the highest concentration in treated effluent samples. Sulfamethoxazole showed the lowest removal (0-75%). Several pharmaceuticals showed consistently higher sorption capacity and longer persistency compared with steroids regardless of soil types and depths. Poamoho (Oxisol soil) and Waimanalo (Mollisol soil) showed the highest sorption capacity, while Waimea (Entisol soil) showed the lowest sorption capacity. Soil physico-chemical properties (i.e., day content, level of organic carbon, and presence of metal oxide) and soil depth highly impacted the sorption behavior of the selected pharmaceutical compounds. In particular, the sorption capacity decreased with soil depth due to the higher level of organic carbon present in the first 30 cm compared with the deeper depths (60-90 cm). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Water pollution is one of the major concerns over long-term sustainability of the environment. Effective and efficient treatment of polluted wastewater is still a serious challenge for global researchers. In the last 2-3 decades, due to the incessant emergence of micropollutants in surface and ground water bodies, several endeavors have been made to resolve the water pollution issues either through chemical, physical and biological degradation processes or through removal/separation processes using different adsorbents and membranes. It has been found that most of the studies are mainly limited to single or binary pollutant analysis in a pure water matrix. Therefore, in this novel investigation, a mixture of five different pollutants has been studied for UV/TiO2-based photocatalytic degradation. In the present study, a commercially available TiO2, an antibiotic, i.e. Ciprofloxacin and four different synthetic dyes, i.e. Rhodamine B, Methylene Blue, Methyl Orange and Amaranth have been used as a photocatalyst, a pharmaceutical and various industrial dyes, respectively, in a batch photocatalytic reactor system with a stirrer. It is important to note that the commercial TiO2 photocatalyst has also been characterized with the help of several characterization techniques. The present study is mainly focused on the degradation of different micropollutants present in the simulated wastewater matrix and their individual degradation kinetics. It is interesting to observe that MB and RhB have shown the maximum degradation followed by CIP (96.21, 96.15 and 89.62%, respectively). In addition, a microbiological assay has also been performed to check the toxicity variation in the degraded products. It is quite interesting to observe that the simulated wastewater matrix has completely lost its microbial toxicity within 120 min of UV/TiO2-based photocatalytic treatment. Finally, total organic carbon evaluations of various treated samples have also been performed and the obtained results substantiate the theory of assimilable organic carbon.

AB The objective of this paper is to help understanding the distinctive influence of the matrix and of the flux decline (e.g. through the cake enhanced concentration polarization (CECP) phenomenon) on the removal mechanisms of four pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent by nanofiltration (NF). PhACs which are commonly encountered in secondary treated effluent were spiked in various matrix (real and synthetic) to investigate the separate and synergetic effects of the organic and ionic environment on PhACs rejection by two commercial membranes (NF-90 and NF-270). With pure water, rejection of NF membranes is dependent on the type of PhACs and of the permeate flux variations. Then, it appeared that the rejection of PhACs by NF-90 was poorly influenced by the type of compounds, because of the prevalence of steric mechanisms, but rather influenced by permeate flux variations and thus to fouling. For this tight NF membrane, CECP impacts PhACs rejection at the start of filtration while after a dense cake is formed, it became enhanced. On the contrary, rejections of PhACs by the NF-270 were enhanced during the filtration of the real wastewater in comparison with spiked pure water. It appeared that for loose-NF membranes, PhACs rejection is mainly governed by solute-solute interactions (EfOM-compound association) or electrostatic membrane-solute interactions. Finally, it seems that calcium concentration of the effluent is a critical parameter for the rejection of PhACs as it alters both the availability of sites for PhACs association and the fouling layer density. Rejections of the NF-270 were negatively impacted in the presence of Ca2+. Such a study has practical implications for further understanding of the fate of trace organic compounds during nano filtration of wastewater for reuse applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Synthetic musk compounds (SMCs) occur widely in water environments. The aims of this paper were to investigate the occurrence and fate of SMCs in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and surface waters. Total SMC concentrations ranged from 3.69 to 7.33 mu g/L (influent) and from 0.96 to 2.69 mu g/L (effluent) in 10 STPs. The SMC concentrations varied with the input source and treatment volume of each STP. Biological treatment processes had a greater SMCs removal effect than chemical treatment, filtration and disinfection processes. The SMC concentrations in surface waters ranged from 0.15 to 16.72 mu g/L and exhibited similar SMCs occurrence patterns generally. The fate of SMCs in water environments depends on their physical-chemical properties and their concentrations can be predicted from other SMC concentrations due to their similar fates.

DE Urban wastewater; Catalytic wet peroxide oxidation; Persulfate

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) widely present in urban wastewater effluents pose a threat to ecosystems in the receiving aquatic environment. In this work, efficiency of granular activated carbon (GAC) - based catalytic processes, namely catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO), peroxymonosulfate oxidation (PMS/GAC) and peroxydisulfate oxidation (PDS/GAC) at ambient temperature and pressure were studied for removal of 22 PhACs (ng L-1 level) that were present in secondary effluents of real urban wastewater. Concentrations of PhACs were measured using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). Catalytic experiments were conducted in discontinuous mode using up-flow fixed bed reactors with granular activated carbon (GAC) as a catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by means of N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), elemental analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (WDXRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetry and differential temperature analyses coupled mass spectrometry (TGA-DTA-MS). Results indicate that the highest efficiency in terms of TOC removal was achieved during CWPO performed at optimal operational conditions (stoichiometric dose of H2O2; TOC removal similar to 82%) followed by PMS/GAC (initial PMS concentration 100 mg L-1; TOC removal similar to 73.7%) and PDS/GAC (initial PDS concentration 100 mg L-1; TOC removal similar to 67.9%) after 5 min of contact time. Full consumption of oxidants was observed in all cases for CWPO and PDS/GAC at contact times of 2.5 min, while for PMS/GAC it was 1.5 min. In general, for 18 out of 22 target PhACs, very high removal efficiencies (> 92%) were achieved in all tested processes (including adsorption) performed at optimal operational conditions during 5 min of contact time. However, moderate (40 - 70%) and poor (< 40%) removal efficiencies were achieved for salicylic acid, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, which can be possibly attributed to insufficient contact time. Despite high efficiency of all studied processes for PhACs elimination from urban wastewater effluent, CWPO seems to be more promising for continuous operation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the removal of common emerging contaminants (ECs) and related estrogenic activity from wastewater effluent by a strain of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor with previously unreported bioremediation potential. T. versicolor NRRL 66313 was grown in carbon-amended sterile secondary wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Aerated batch reactors containing sterile, glucose-amended (5 g l(-1)) wastewater were inoculated, incubated for eight days, and then spiked with either 5 mg l(-1) of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), or a mixture of E2, atrazine (ATZ), bisphenol A (BPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), estrone (E1), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), oxybenzone (OBZ), and triclosan (TCS) to a final concentration of 350 mu g l(-1) each. Abiotic and heat-killed fungus controls were also prepared. EC and metabolite concentrations were measured over time using HPLC and Gas Chromatography coupled with Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). Estrogenic activity was measured on the same samples using the Yeast Estrogen Screen. In less than 5 h, active fungi decreased the concentration of E2 from 5 mg l(-1) to below detection, producing E1 as a metabolite and subsequently removing it from solution. Acting on the mixture of ECs, fungi removed BPA, E1, E2, and EE2 to a significant degree (62-100%) vs. controls (0-28%) in only 3.5 h, reducing the estrogenic activity of the mixture by 77% (vs. 4-8% for controls). After 12 h, the total reduction of estrogenic activity was greater than 98% (vs. 24-42% for controls). These results show that T versicolor NRRL 66313 can reduce the estrogenic activity of mixtures of estrogens and BPA, which are typically the most significant contributors to the hormone disrupting activity of domestic WWTP effluent.

AB Due to concerns about ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants released from wastewater treatment plants, activated carbon adsorption is one of the few processes to effectively reduce the concentrations of micropollutants in wastewater. Although aimed mainly at apolar compounds, polar compounds are also simultaneously removed to a certain extent, which has rarely been studied before. In this study, adsorption isotherm and batch kinetic data were collected with two powdered activated carbons (PACs) to assess the removal of the polar pharmaceuticals 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and cytarabine (CytR) from ultrapure water and wastewater treatment plant effluent. At pH 7.8, single-solute adsorption isotherm data for the weak acid 5-Fu and the weak base CytR showed that their adsorption capacities were about 1 order of magnitude lower than those of the less polar endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). To remove 90 % of the adsorbate from a single-solute solution 14, 18, 70, and 87 mg L-1 of HOK Super is required for EE2, BPA, CytR, and 5-Fu, respectively. Effects of solution pH, ionic strength, temperature, and effluent organic matter (EfOM) on 5-Fu and CytR adsorption were evaluated for one PAC. Among the studied factors, the presence of EfOM had the highest effect, due to a strong competition on 5-Fu and CytR adsorption. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic data and their modeling with a homogeneous surface diffusion model showed that removal percentage in the presence of EfOM was independent on the initial concentration of the ionizable compounds 5-Fu and CytR. These results are similar to neutral organic compounds in the presence of natural organic matter. Overall, results showed that PAC doses sufficient to remove > 90 % of apolar adsorbates were able to remove no more than 50 % of the polar adsorbates 5-Fu and CytR and that the contact time is a critical parameter.

AB Wastewater-based epidemiology (WEE), the per capita normalised measurement of drugs, chemicals or metabolites in wastewater influent, relies on sampling and quantitative analysis to evaluate temporal and spatial trends of chemical consumption. Continuous, high-resolution, flow proportional composite sampling is optimal for accurate representations of chemical mass loads, but is rarely implemented, with conventional autosamplers providing relatively low frequency time or volume proportional samples. However, due to equipment or resource constraints at many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), even this may not be feasible. Passive sampling may provide an alternative sampling strategy. To investigate this, samplers comprising hollow, cylindrical Microporous Polyethylene Tubes (MPTs) containing polymeric sorbent phases of Strata-X and Strata-X in agarose were simultaneously deployed in a municipal WWTP influent stream. Samplers were extracted, analysed and evaluated for a range of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) after 4, 7, 15, 21, and 29 day deployments. The MPT samplers were calibrated against 24-hour time proportional composite grab samples that were collected in parallel. Diffusion through the MPT governed uptake, reducing or eliminating the influence of external flow rates that may fluctuate unpredictably in a WWTP environment. Calibration data for six illicit drugs and fourteen PPCPs, including methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, MDMA, codeine and carbamazepine, demonstrated linear accumulation in the samplers (R-2 >= 0.84). Derived sampling rates for these analytes ranged from 025 to 17 mL d(-1) for ibuprofen and verapamil, respectively. A validation study using this sampling rate data showed the MPT could effectively quantify concentrations (>= 0.1 ng mL(-1)) of a range of amphetamine- type stimulants, opioids and metabolites as well as nicotine, accounting for 95% of the variance in parallel composite grab sample concentrations of these compounds. The MPT sampler shows promise for providing essential monitoring data for WBE, informing future intervention and research strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was simultaneously monitored. The experiment took place in autumn. An analytical methodology including HPLC-MS/MS was developed to measure antibiotic concentrations in the soluble water fraction, in the suspended solids fraction and in the WWTP sludge. Considering the soluble water fraction, the only easily eliminated antibiotics in the WWTP were doxycycline (61 +/- 38%) and sulfamethoxazole (60 +/- 26%). All the studied types of CWs were efficient for the removal of sulfamethoxazole (59 +/- 30-87 +/- 41%), as found in the WWTP, and, in addition, they removed trimethoprim (65 +/- 21-96 +/- 29%). The elimination of other antibiotics in CWs was limited by the specific system-configuration: amoxicillin (45 +/- 15%) was only eliminated by a free-water (FW) subsurface flow (SSF) CW planted with Typha angustifolia; doxycycline was removed in FW systems planted with T. angustifolia (65 +/- 34-75 +/- 40%), in a Phragmites australis-floating macrophytes system (62 +/- 31%) and in conventional horizontal SSF-systems (71 +/- 39%); clarithromycin was partially eliminated by an unplanted FW-SSF system (50 +/- 18%); erythromycin could only be removed by a P. australis-horizontal SSF system (64 +/- 30%); and ampicillin was eliminated by a T. angustifolia-floating macrophytes system (29 +/- 4%). Lincomycin was not removed by any of the systems (WWTP or CWs). The presence or absence of plants, the vegetal species (T. angustifolia or P. australis), the flow type and the CW design characteristics regulated the specific removal mechanisms. Therefore, CWs are not an overall solution to remove antibiotics from urban wastewater during cold seasons. However, more studies are needed to assess their ability in warmer periods and to determine the behaviour of full-scale systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The release into the environment of antimicrobial compounds from both human and agricultural sources is a growing global concern. The Grand River watershed, the largest mixed-use watershed in southern Ontario, receives runoff from intensive animal production as well as municipal wastewater effluents from a rapidly increasing human population. A survey of surface waters and wastewater effluents was conducted across the watershed to assess the occurrence and distribution of several antimicrobials (i.e., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, lincomycin, and monensin) and chemical indicators (i.e., ammonia, nitrate, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, atrazine) and to characterize exposure levels. The human antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were detected in the urban areas of the main channel at mean concentrations of 8 +/- 7 ng/L and 31 +/- 24 ng/L, respectively, but at much lower concentrations in the agricultural tributaries. In contrast, the veterinary antimicrobial sulfamethazine was detected at a mean concentration of 11 +/- 9 ng/L in the main channel, and at a much higher concentration in the agricultural tributaries. Lincomycin was detected in only two river samples and not in the effluents while monensin was not detected in all samples. The herbicide atrazine was detected at very low concentrations in the surface waters of both the tributaries and the main channel. The concentrations of the antimicrobials and chemical indicators generally increased downstream of the confluences with agricultural tributaries and effluent outfalls. In the wastewater effluents, the concentrations of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and venlafaxine decreased with increasing treatment levels (i.e., secondary to tertiary) as indicated by ammonia/nitrate concentrations. There was a strong correlation among trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and venlafaxine in the main channel and in the wastewater effluents. While the environmental concentrations of antimicrobials in the watershed are low relative to toxicity thresholds, their persistence in the environment may be an important consideration in defining strategies for future water management.

AB Estrogenic activity of treated sewage effluents and receiving waters surfaced as an issue of general concern some 15 years ago. Since then, a large number of studies investigated the distribution and nature of the estrogenic substances in various aquatic ecosystems. Within NRP50, a five-year Swiss research programme on endocrine disruptors, four field studies were performed to characterize the presence of environmental estrogens in rivers and effluents. The estrogenic activity was quantified with a biological assay - the yeast estrogen screen. An overview of the sampling approaches and results of the various studies is presented here. In a first study, using grab sampling, it appeared that estrogenic activity in river water was highly variable. Average estrogenicity values did not correlate with sewage treatment works and/or river characteristics, e.g. effluent dilution factor. However, variability was not 'random' but clearly associated with river size, and possibly its discharge. A second study specifically addressed this issue of variability of estrogenicity. The study was conducted at a single effluent source and its receiving river. Variability of estrogenicity in the grab samples was again large but again not 'random'; some of the variability was explained by the time over which the effluent resided in the treatment process. In a third study it was explored if passive sampling would be a better way to assess average estrogenicity. Indeed, passive samplers identified sources of estrogens, and passive sampling data correlated well with both repeated grab sampling and bioaccumulation data. Subsequently, passive samplers were deployed across Switzerland in a fourth study. It involved 22 effluent discharges and the associated rivers. Data analysis of the last study is still ongoing, preliminary observations are discussed here. Although a lot could be learned from repeated grab sampling campaigns, it emerged that passive sampling is a very effective and appropriate technique to assess: i) effluent treatment efficiency, and ii) the chemical load of river water. For these reasons it is a valuable monitoring tool for water quality criteria assessments as well as for studies that aim to link exposure and effect. The passive samplers that are currently available not only target estrogenic substances, but many other polar organic compounds of concern, such as antibiotics (see NRP49), other pharmaceuticals and biocides.

AB The drinking water production of a drinking water treatment plant in Berlin is affected by ambient contaminated groundwater. The three organic compounds para-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA), ortho-toluenesulfonamide (o-TSA) and benzenesulfonamide (BSA) were identified in the catchment area of this plant. The groundwater pollution is a result of former sewage farm irrigation in the area, operating for almost 70 years until the 1980s. The distribution of the sulfonamides in the anoxic groundwater was investigated, and a large number of observation and production wells were sampled for this purpose. The contaminant plume is 25 m*3000m*2000 m (depth, length, width) in size. The high concentrations of p-TSA, o-TSA and BSA in the groundwater show that the sulfonamides persist over decades in an anoxic aquifer environment. Groundwater quality assessment revealed that elevated concentrations of the analytes can be expected in the abstraction well galleries in the future. Therefore, sulfonamides should periodically be monitored in the drinking water (maximum allowed concentration of 0.30 mu g/L of p-TSA and for o-TSA and BSA, a limit of 0.10 mu g/L for unknown substances applies). Because of the widespread application and the persistence of the sulfonamides under anoxic conditions, our local investigations suggest that the substances may generally be present in groundwater under the influence of sewage irrigation. Incubation experiments were conducted under in situ hydrostatic pressure to study the behaviour of these trace organic compounds under different redox conditions (oxic and anoxic). Groundwater sampling equipment was either sterilised or not sterilised in order to distinguish between microbiological processes occurring in the aquifer and those representing sampling and storage artefacts (incubation experiments). Results showed that the addition of oxygen to the anoxic groundwater facilitates p-TSA and o-TSA degradation. Hence, while the substances are persistent under anoxic conditions, they are more degradable in the presence of oxygen. Results also illustrate that maintaining anoxic conditions or applying appropriate preservation techniques is necessary to ensure accurate analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In testing a series of bismuth oxybromo-iodide (BiOBrxI1-x; 0 <= x <= 1) solid solutions, BiOBr0.9I0.1, due to its superior charge-carriers separation, exhibited the best performance in the visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Subsequently, its superparamagnetic version, BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO2, possessing a mesoporous hierarchical morphology, was solvothermally developed, and completely degraded the two model PPCPs, ibuprofen and benzophenone-3, in 1 and 2 h, respectively. Scavenger studies revealed that the ibuprofen degradation was dominated by e(-), O-center dot(2)-, and h(+), while the benzophenone-3 degradation was dominated by e(-) and O-center dot(2)-. Hydroxylation, decarboxylation, and demethylation were found to be the major reactions involved in the degradation pathways. The aquatic toxicity of the intermediates - estimated using the ECOSAR software - was found to be lower than for the parent PPCP molecules, indicating a reduced environmental risk after photocatalytic degradation. The solution matrix study elaborated the varying extent of the interacting roles of the co-present anions, cations, and NOM. The reusability and stability of BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO(2)was examined in real secondary treated sewage in a prototype photocatalytic reactor equipped with a magnetic separator. Due to the interferences and unwanted interactions caused by the co-present constituents in secondary treated sewage, a gradual loss in the photocatalytic performance of BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO2 was observed during consecutive rounds of recycling.

AB Among the solutions to reduce micropollutant discharges into the aquatic environment, activated carbon adsorption is a promising technique and a large scale pilot has been tested at the Seine Centre (240,000 m(3)/d-Paris, France) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). While most of available works studied fixed bed or contact reactors with a separated separation step, this study assesses a new type of tertiary treatment based on a fluidized bed containing a high mass of activated carbon, continuously renewed. For the first time in the literature, micro-grain activated carbon (mu GAC) was studied. The aims were (1) to determine the performances of fluidized bed operating with mu CAG on both emerging micropollutants and conventional wastewater quality parameters, and (2) to compare its efficiency and applicability to wastewater to former results obtained with PAC. Thus, conventional wastewater quality parameters (n = 11), pharmaceuticals and hormones (PPHs; n = 62) and other emerging pollutants (n = 57) have been monitored in mu GAC configuration during 13 campaigns.
   A significant correlation has been established between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), PPHs and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV-254) removals. This confirms that UV-254 could be used as a tertiary treatment performance indicator to monitor the process. This parameter allowed identifying that the removals of UV-254 and DOC reach a plateau from a mu GAC retention time (SRT) of 90-100 days.
   The mu GAC configuration substantially improves the overall quality of the WWTP discharges by reducing biological (38-45%) and chemical oxygen demands (21-48%), DOC (13-44%) and UV-254 (22-48%). In addition, total suspended solids (TSS) are retained by the mu GAC bed and a biological activity (nitratation) leads to a total elimination of NO2-.
   For micropollutants, PPHs have a good affinity for mu GAC and high (>60%) or very high (>80%) removals are observed for most of the quantified compounds (n=22/32), i.e. atenolol (92-97%), carbamazepine (80-94%), ciprofloxacin (75-95%), diclofenac (71-97%), oxazepam (74-91%) or sulfamethoxazole (56-83%). In addition, alkylphenols, artificial sweeteners, benzotriazole, bisphenol A, personal care products (triclocarban and parabens) and pesticides have removals lying in the 50->90% range.
   Overall, the fluidized bed of mu GAC allows obtaining performances comparable to PAC at the sameactivated carbon dose. Indeed, the average removal of the 13 PPHs found at a high occurrence (>75%) in WWTP discharges is similar at 20 g/m(3) of mu GAC (78-89%) and PAC (85-93%). In addition, this recycled mu GAC operation leads to several operational advantages (no FeCl3, reactivable, higher SRT, higher treated flow) and has a stronger impact on the overall wastewater quality compared to PAC.

AB There is a consensus among scientists that domestic sewage treatment plants are the main sources of drugs entry into the aquatic environment. Therefore, this work studies the biodegradation of the drugs ranitidine (RNT), diclofenac (DCF), and simvastatin (SVT) (50 mu g L-1, each), in real domestic sewage, using a continuous anaerobic-aerobic reactor with immobilized biomass and an anaerobic batch reactor. The continuous anaerobic-aerobic reactor was operated for 6 months with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h. The initial degradation rates and the maximum oxidation capacities (MOC) of the system were estimated, achieving 90, 72, and 62% removals and 100, 93, and 72% of MOC for RNT, DCF and SVT, respectively, as well as 71% removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). RNT was degraded throughout the reactor, while DCF was degraded mainly in the two anaerobic chambers and SVT in the first anaerobic chamber. Anaerobic batches were used for the identification of biodegradation by-products (2,6-dichloro-N-(2-methylphenyl) aniline and simvastatin acid), the evaluation of the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) inhibition, and the estimation of acute and chronic ecotoxicities using the ECOSAR 1.11 software. The present study showed that, even at environmental concentrations, RNT, DCF, and SVT were capable of inhibiting the SMA. Lipophilicities dictated the behavior of those three drugs. The greater their lipophilicities, the greater the SMA inhibition and their ecotoxicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Low content of micropollutants in sewage sludge, essential to allow its safe re-use in agriculture, requires effective removals during the digestion phase. To this purpose, we investigated the performance of the anaerobic-aerobic sequential digestion process applied to real waste sludge in the removal of several classes of standard pollutants, i.e. extractable organic halogens (EOXs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and alkylphenolethoxylates. In addition, emerging pollutants were also investigated based on their widespread occurrence and on their physicochemical characteristics and eco-toxicological relevance: quaternary ammonium compounds, a number of pharmaceuticals and selected biocides. The anaerobic step was conducted at mesophilic conditions, while two operating temperatures were tested for the post-aerobic treatment, i.e. 20 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Results showed that the post-aerobic digestion step enhanced the removal of all investigated standard and emerging micropollutants, even in presence of high accumulation in the anaerobic digestate (occurred for some PAHs and PCB congeners). Increased removals (up to 30%) have been generally observed at 37 degrees C aerobic temperature in comparison with tests at T = 20 degrees C for all investigated organic micropollutants, with the only exception of halogenated compounds (i.e. EOXs and PCBs). Low biodegradability and high bioaccumulation of the investigated pollutants were successfully faced by the sequential process, which has been demonstrated as an effective alternative solution to produce digested sludge for safe agricultural re-use.

AB Removal of low-concentration (ng/L similar to mu g/L) antibiotics from water calls for the development of cost-effective treatment technologies. In this study, a novel moving-bed electrochemical membrane bioreactor (MEMBR) was developed for removing sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Results showed that the introduction of external electric field and carbon felt particles could efficiently eliminate SMX (removal efficiency of 88.9%). In contrast, the moving-bed membrane bioreactor (MMBR) took a long time to acclimate microorganism, reaching a removal efficiency of 43.9%. Transmembrane pressure increase rate was much lower in MEMBR (1.06 kPa/d) compared to MMBR (1.72 kPa/d). The presence of carriers increased the generation of reactive oxygen species, contributing to SMX removal. Microbial community analysis revealed that the introduction of electric field could increase microbial community richness/diversity and enrich the phyla of Actinobacteria and Gemmatimonadete, potentially capable of mineralizing SMX. These results clearly demonstrated the potential of this novel MEMBR to be used for enhanced micropollutants removal from water/wastewater.

AB In addition to removing organics and other nutrients, the microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) biotransform many pharmaceuticals present in wastewater. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between pharmaceutical biotransformation and biodiversity in WWTP bioreactor microbial communities and identify taxa and functional genes that were strongly associated with biotransformation. Dilution-to-extinction of an activated sludge microbial community was performed to establish cultures with a gradient of microbial biodiversity. Batch experiments were performed using the dilution cultures to determine biotransformation extents of several environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals. With this approach, because the communities were all established from the same original community, and using sequencing of the 16S rRNA and metatranscriptome, we identified candidate taxa and genes whose activity and transcript abundances associated with the extent of individual pharmaceutical biotransformation and were lost across the biodiversity gradient. Metabolic genes such as dehydrogenases, amidases and monooxygenases were significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation, and five genera were identified whose activity significantly associated with pharmaceutical biotransformation. Understanding how biotransformation relates to biodiversity will inform the design of biological WWTPs for enhanced removal of chemicals that negatively impact environmental health.

AB A molecularly imprinted polymer was developed and evaluated for selective determination of metronidazole (MNZ) in wastewater. This was achieved by using sodium methacrylate as monomer, toluene as porogen, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker, azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator and metronidazole as template molecule to generate the selectivity of the polymer for the compound, as well as non-imprinted polymers were synthesized. Two different polymerization approaches were used, bulk and emulsion and the polymers obtained by emulsion presented higher retention percentages the MIP 2-M presented the higher retention (83%). The performed method, was validated in fortified water, showing linearity from 10 up to 1000 ng/mL; limit of detection and quantification for compound were between 3 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Finally, the method was applied in samples of a wastewater treatment plant in the city of San Luis Potosi, M,xico, and the concentrations of MNZ in these samples were 84.1-114 ng/mL.

AB Organic micro pollutants can be removed from water by ozonation. In this article we studied the performance of ozonation under real life conditions and compared results of the same ozonation pilot plant installed at different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) thus operating with different waters. The comparability of the removal and reaction rate constants from one waste water treatment plant were low in respect to reaction rate, removal as well as to response to the specific ozone dose. Neither pH-value nor residual nitrite concentrations were the driving force considering these differences. Further tests with different loadings were conducted at the same WWTP under different weather conditions. For the different hydraulic loading of the biological plant, the ozonation was running with rather similar removal rates concerning the same specific (TOC normalized) ozone dose. The compounds that were removed quantitatively under dry weather were still removed well with three times dry weather flow. Using a dataset from one WWTP to optimize operation in another one is thus questionable. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluates the joint effects of erythromycin-sulfamethoxazole (ES) combinations on anaerobic treatment efficiency and the potential for antibiotic degradation during anaerobic sequencing batch reactor operation. The experiments involved two identical anaerobic sequencing batch reactors. One reactor, as control unit, was fed with synthetic wastewater while the other reactor (ES) was fed with a synthetic substrate mixture including ES antibiotic combinations. The influence of ES antibiotic mixtures on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, volatile fatty acid production, antibiotic degradation, biogas production, and composition were investigated. The influent antibiotic concentration was gradually increased over 10 stages, until the metabolic collapse of the reactors, which occurred at 360 days for the ES reactor. The results suggest that substrate/COD utilization and biogas/methane generation affect performance of the anaerobic reactors at higher concentration. In addition, an average of 40% erythromycin and 37% sulfamethoxazole reduction was achieved in the ES reactor. These results indicated that these antibiotics were partly biodegradable in the anaerobic reactor system.

AB The occurrence of 12 active substances among licit and illicit drugs was investigated over a 2 week period inflowing and outflowing in an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in the city of Verona, Northern Italy. Chemical analyses were performed by means of on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in order to minimize sample pre-treatment. Quantifiable concentrations, up to hundreds of ng/L, were detected in influent and in effluent only for carbamazepine, codeine and benzoylecgonine. Such values are in accordance with literature data, so as removal efficiencies: it was observed that there was pretty much no abatement for carbamazepine, while average removal percentages of about 60% and 90% were calculated for codeine and benzoylecgonine, respectively. These results provide useful information (also concerning some active principles never or rarely detected, up to now, such as lormetazepam) for integrated water cycle managing, also taking into account the specific characteristics of the receiving water basin.

AB 4-Aminobenzenesulfonate (4-ABS), an aromatic amine and recalcitrant toxic pollutant, is widely used in the dye and pharmaceutical industry. Pannonibacter sp. W1 is a specialized microbial strain which can efficiently degrade 4-ABS. This study shows the feasibility of using the specialized strain in an MBR system to treat synthetic wastewater containing large amount of 4-ABS. Due to membrane retention, the biomass concentration is able to reach 5 g/L within two months of continuous operation. Pannonibacter sp. W1 is able to adapt to the high loading rate of 1000 mg 4-ABS/L and achieve a remarkable 4-ABS removal efficiency of 99% within 6 h. Strain W1 grows well under the MBR continuous operation and remains as the dominant bacterium at the end of 60 days continuous operation. Minor membrane fouling has been detected within 40 days of operating at 15 LMH. At a flux of 25 LMH, the system experiences the 'TMP jump'. The high organic removal rate and low membrane fouling results illustrate the excellent performance of the bioaugmented MBR system in 4-ABS wastewater treatment.

AB Hospital wastewaters have a high load of pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs). Fungal treatments could be appropriate for source treatment of such effluents but the transition to non-sterile conditions proved to be difficult due to competition with indigenous microorganisms, resulting in very short duration operations. In this article, coagulation-flocculation and UV-radiation processes were studied as pretreatments to a fungal reactor treating non-sterile hospital wastewater in sequential batch operation and continuous operation modes. The influent was spiked with ibuprofen and ketoprofen, and both compounds were successfully degraded by over 80%. UV pretreatment did not extent the fungal activity after coagulation-flocculation measured as laccase production and pellet integrity. Sequential batch operation did not reduce bacteria competition during fungal treatment. The best strategy was the addition of a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment to a continuous reactor, which led to an operation of 28 days without biomass renovation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The kinetics of the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PW), pretreated in a first stage by electrocaogulation (EC), using an anaerobic fixed-film fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The experimental results for the substrate removal kinetics were found to be in good agreement with those of the Monod model and the modified Stover-Kincannon model, with a high regression value (R-2 > 0.9). For the modified Stover-Kincannon model, the constants U-max and K-B were found to be 13.1 and 13.87 kg COD/(m(3) . d) respectively. With reference to the biomass kinetics, the increase in organic loading rate (OLR) is attributed to the increased biomass growth rate (mu) and decrease in the biological constant K-mu. The corresponding constants for the modified Monod's model, i.e. 'mu(max) and decay constant K-d, were found to be 0.159 and 0.0113 d(-1) respectively. Finally, the gas production kinetics was interpreted in relation to the Kincannon-Stover model.

AB An intensive sampling campaign has been carried out in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to assess the dynamics of the influent pharmaceutical active compounds (PhAC) and musks. The mass loadings of these compounds in wastewater influents displayed contrasting diurnal variations depending on the compound. The musks and some groups of PhACs tended to follow a similar diurnal trend as compared to macropollutants, while the majority of PhACs followed either the opposite trend or no repeatable trend. The total musk loading to the WWTP was 0.74 +/- 0.25 g d(-1), whereas the total PhAC mass loading was 84.7 +/- 63.8 g d(-1). Unlike the PhACs, the musks displayed a high repeatability from one sampling day to the next. The range of PhAC loadings in the influent to WWTPs can vary several orders of magnitude from one day or week to the next, representing a challenge in obtaining data for steady-state modelling purposes.

AB In this work, we have constructed a novel graphitic carbon nitride/multiwall carbon nanotube (GCN/CNT) doped Ti/PbO2 as anode for highly effective degradation of acetaminophen (ACE) wastewater. The ACE removal efficiency of 83.2% and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 76.3% are achieved under the optimal condition of temperature 25 degrees C, initial pH 7, current density 15 mA cm(-2) and Na2SO4 concentration 6.0 g L-1. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Ti/PbO2-GCN-CNTanode for ACE oxidation is ascribed to the effective suppression of oxygen evolution and the enhanced electron transfer after introducing GCN and CNT. Furthermore, Ti/PbO2-GCN-CNT electrode displays excellent stability and reusability. ACE degradation is accomplished by direct oxidation and indirect oxidation, and center dot OH radical plays primary role in the indirect oxidation of ACE wastewater. The intermediates of ACE degradation are detailly investigated using LC-MS analysis and a possible degradation mechanism is proposed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotics such as tetracycline are used on a large scale in agriculture, and can become concentrated in wastewater lagoons that are used in conjunction with confined animal feeding operations. Solar-illuminated titanium dioxide can be used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous tetracycline, but its application in a lagoon environment requires that the photocatalyst be supported on a macroscopic support material to prevent loss of the nanoscale photocatalyst into the environment. In this work, titanium dioxide was deposited within a porous poly(methyl methacrylate) film on the surface of floating 7.0 cm diameter acrylic spheres. Six of these floating spheres removed over 96% of the tetracycline in 3.5 L of 60 mg/L tetracycline in natural pond water during 24 hours of solar illumination. The durability of these spheres under long-term solar exposure was also investigated along with the amount of photocatalyst lost from the sphere surface during use. These macroscale floating composite spheres provide a new method for removing tetracycline from wastewater lagoons with minimal risk of being displaced in the environment due to the large size of the spheres.

AB Swine wastewater is not easy to dispose of in usual biological wastewater treatment plants One reason is that some antibiotics are not easily degradable in the normal treatment system and suppress or inhibit microorganisms in the treatment system Specifically tetracycline, sulfathiazole. and ampicillin have been widely used as antibiotics in pig feed For treating disposal and spillage of these antibiotics biologically, a special enzyme based method is needed Detoxifying enzymes caused the antibiotics to be bio-converted in this experiment and degraded them in this biological experiment The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) catalyzed the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to a number of hydrophobic electrophilic substrates. In this study. we hypothesized that the microorganisms with GSTs degraded the representative manure antibiotics The initial concentrations of tetracycline. sulfathiazole, and ampicillin were 100 mg/L. 100 mg/L, and 50 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations of antibiotics in pig feed are typical levels Evaluation of the biodegradation feasibility of antibiotics was carried out by three bacteria possessing glutathione S-transferases under the strong concentration of antibiotics (standards for livestock pharmaceuticals in pie feed)

AB The deterioration in its strength from long-term degradation of organic matter and release of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have caused adverse environmental effects in municipal sewage sludge (MSS) landfill. Lime and a mixture of lime and mussel shell were employed as potential stabilization agents for MSS in this work. Their efficacy was assessed by investigating the effects on transformation of organic matter, as well as the occurrence and fate of four PhACs (fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, triclosan and carbamazepine) over 42 days. The addition of the selected agents: (i) prevented the microbial degradation of organic matter; (ii) modified the predominant functional groups of amide groups (amide I and II) and polysaccharides to deprotonated carboxylic groups and destruction of amide groups; and (iii) shifted the abundance of organic constituents from microbial by-products to humic acid-like organics with conformational changes. The measurement method provided reliable and precise results for determining PhAC concentrations in MSS with and without amendment, although matrix effects and process effects were found to affect measurement sensitivity. Available fractions of the PhACs increased in MSS with lime addition, but decreased in the presence of the mixture of lime and mussel shell due to the strong adsorption effects of the shells. The mixture of lime and mussel shell would be recommended for stabilizing MSS prior to being landfilled. However, longer term and larger scale investigation may be needed to better evaluate the applicability of lime and mussel shell for reducing the hazards and facilitating the management of MSS.

AB Norfloxacin (NOR), an antibiotic widely used in livestock and poultry production, has become ubiquitous in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as a result of veterinary excretion of the parent compound or its active metabolites. The sorption of NOR onto humic acid (HA) may influence the fate of NOR in the environment. In the present study, HA was extracted from sewage sludge in different composting stages of days 0, 10, 30, and 70 to investigate the sorption of NOR onto HA as affected by the humification degree of HA. The results of elemental and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum analyses showed that the contents of aromatic and carboxylic groups in HA increased with composting time, indicating an increase of humification degree. The result of sorption experiments demonstrated that the HA had a high sorption capacity for NOR with strong nonlinearity. A two-stage sorption was observed in the sorption process with an equilibration time of 48 h. Both the Freundlich model (Adj. R (2) range 0.988-0.994) and Langmuir model (Adj. R (2) range 0.917-0.928) fitted well with all sorption isotherms of the HA samples of different humification degrees. Moreover, the increase of sorption distribution coefficient (K (d) ) value with composting time indicated that the sorption affinity of HA for NOR increased with increasing humification degree of HA. The major sorption mechanism was the interaction between NOR and rich aromatic moieties and carboxylic group in the HA.

AB For human pharmaceuticals, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are a major point of entry to surface waters. The receiving waters provide vital functions. Modeling the impact of STPs on susceptible functions of the surface water system allows for a spatially smart implementation of abatement options at, or in the service area of, STPs.
   This study was performed on a nation-wide scale for the Netherlands. Point source emissions included were 345 Dutch STPs and nine rivers from neighboring countries. The Dutch surface waters were represented by 2511 surface water units. Modeling was performed for two extreme discharge conditions. Monitoring data of 7 locations along the rivers Rhine and Meuse fall mostly within the range of modeled concentrations. Half of the abstracted volumes of raw water for drinking water production, and a quarter of the Natura 2000 areas (European Union nature protection areas) hosted by the surface waters, are influenced by STPs at low discharge. The vast majority of the total impact of all Dutch STPs during both discharge conditions can be attributed to only 19% of the STPs with regard to the drinking water function, and to 39% of the STPs with regard to the Natura 2000 function.
   Attributing water treatment technologies to STPs as one of the possible measures to improve water quality and protect susceptible functions can be done in a spatially smart and cost-effective way, using consumption-based detailed hydrological and water quality modeling.

AB Present study deals with the treatment of simulated chemical pharmaceutical wastewater (SCPW) using Fenton oxidation process for the degradation of typical pollutants containing n-butanol, ethyl p-nitrobenzoate, 4, 7dichloroquinoline and ethyl acetoacetate. The effects of operational parameters like the initial pH, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, H2O2 dosage and reaction time on the degradation efficiency of pollutants and biodegradability of SCPW were investigated. The Fenton reaction steps and the removal kinetics of SCPW were analyzed. Finally, the effects of the molecular structure on the degradation efficiency of organics were investigated. The degradation ratio of n-butanol, ethyl acetoacetate, 4, 7-dichloroquinoline, ethyl p-nitrobenzoate and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in SCPW is 56%, 75%, 100%, 78% and 38%, respectively, for conditions of initial pH of 2.5, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 20, H2O2 dosage of 0.6 Q (Q is the theoretical dosage of Fenton reagent) and reaction time of 30 min. The reaction steps analysis indicated that the biodegradability of SCPW was improved mainly by the oxidation intermediate of pollutants. The kinetics study showed that the removal processes of pollutants and COD were consistent with the second-order kinetic model. Quantum chemical analysis showed that the correlation between the total energy E-RB3LYP and removal kinetic constant K-[RH] was most significant, and E-RB3LYP was negatively correlated with K-[RH]. The results indicated that the higher the total energy of the organics, the more difficult it was to be removed. The findings reported herein are significant to predict the treatment efficiency of pollutants in real pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), including pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners, steroid hormones, and current-use pesticides have been detected in surface waters around the world, but to date, there have been no reports in the peer-reviewed literature on the levels of these classes of contaminants in freshwater resources in the Caribbean region. In the present study, multi-residue solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) were used to analyze grab samples of surface waters collected from five different watersheds in Barbados, West Indies. The artificial sweeteners (AS), acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose were widely detected in the watersheds, indicating contamination from domestic wastewater, and the concentrations of these chemical tracers in water were correlated with the concentrations of the non-prescription pharmaceutical, ibuprofen (R-2 values of 0.4-0.6). Surprisingly, the concentrations of another chemical tracer of domestic wastewater, caffeine were not correlated with ibuprofen or AS concentrations. Several other prescription pharmaceuticals and the steroid hormones, estrone and androstenedione, were detected in selected watersheds at low ng/L concentrations. The fungicide, chlorothalonil was widely detected in surface waters at low (<10 ng/L) concentrations, but the levels of this pesticide were not correlated with the concentrations of the other target analytes, indicating that the source of this pesticide is not domestic wastewater. An informal survey of disposal practices for out of date or unused drugs by pharmacies in Barbados indicated that disposal into trash destined for the landfill and flushing down the sink might be significant sources of contamination of water resources by pharmaceuticals.

AB The present paper reports a detailed study that is based on the monitoring of naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac in Mbokodweni River and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located around the city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Target compounds were extracted from water samples using a multi-template molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction prior to separation and quantification on a high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photo diode array detector. The analytical method yielded the detection limits of 0.15, 1.00, and 0.63 mu g/L for naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, respectively. Solid-phase extraction method was evaluated for its performance using deionized water samples that were spiked with 5 and 50 mu g/L of target compounds. Recoveries were greater than 80% for all target compounds with RSD values in the range of 4.1 to 10%. Target compounds were detected in most wastewater and river water samples with ibuprofen being the most frequently detected pharmaceutical. Maximum concentrations detected in river water for naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac were 6.84, 19.2, and 9.69 mu g/L, respectively. The concentrations of target compounds found in effluent and river water samples compared well with some studies. The analytical method employed in this work is fast, selective, sensitive, and affordable; therefore, it can be used routinely to evaluate the occurrence of acidic pharmaceuticals in South African water resources.

AB Dissolved ozone flotation (DOF) treatment method was applied to oxidize soluble substances, i.e., emerging micropollutants that are not completely removed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) in cosmetic wastewater treatment. With the DOF method, solid particles float on the top of the treated solution, and soluble substances are oxidized by ozone. Twelve aluminium-based coagulants were used in the experiments: Al 6010, Al 3010, Al 3030, Al 3035, Al 1019, Al 2019, PAX XL19, PAX16, Flokor 1.3, Flokor 1S, Flokor 1.2a, and Megafloc. Of all the coagulants, the two with the highest efficiency were selected: Al 3010 and Al 6010. The results obtained by both treatment methods, DOF and DAF, show similar chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal 79.1% and 78.8%, respectively, and total suspended solids (TSS) removal 95.2% and 94.4%, respectively, for Brenntag 6010. For Brenntag 3010 removal rate of 81.3% and 81.0% COD was observed, and the same 96.3% TSS removal for both DAF and DOF methods. However, extended removal of micropollutants was observed in the DOF method. The headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis was used to identify the compounds in wastewater and to evaluate the effectiveness of both methods that were used. The HS-SPME-GC-MS results confirmed that the DOF process with using coagulant Al 3010 had better removal efficiency compared with DAF. The removal rate of micropollutants including endocrine disruptors for DOF was 96.3% compared with 93.8% when using DAF treatment.

AB Secondary treated wastewater was infiltrated through a 9 m-thick calcareous vadose zone during a 39 month managed aquifer recharge (MAR) field trial to determine potential improvements in the recycled water quality. The water quality improvements of the recycled water were based on changes in the chemistry and microbiology of (i) the recycled water prior to infiltration relative to (ii) groundwater immediately down-gradient from the infiltration gallery. Changes in the average concentrations of several constituents in the recycled water were identified with reductions of 30% for phosphorous, 66% for fluoride, 62% for iron and 51% for total organic carbon when the secondary treated wastewater was infiltrated at an applied rate of 17.5 L per minute with a residence time of approximately four days in the vadose zone and less than two days in the aquifer. Reductions were also noted for oxazepam and temazepam among the pharmaceuticals tested and for a range of microbial pathogens, but reductions were harder to quantify as their magnitudes varied over time. Total nitrogen and carbamazepine persisted in groundwater down-gradient from the infiltration galleries. Infiltration does potentially offer a range of water quality improvements over direct injection to the water table without passage through the unsaturated zone; however, additional treatment options for the non-potable water may still need to be considered, depending on the receiving environment or the end use of the recovered water.

AB The objective of the presented paper is to characterize the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater during ozonation in laboratory-scale conditions. Almost 100 pharmaceuticals and their metabolites from different therapeutic classes were studied in effluent from the wastewater treatment plant, Devinska Nova Ves, used for ozonation. Telmisartan, diclofenac, and fexofenadine were found at the highest concentrations (1800 ng/dm(3), 680 ng/dm(3), and 620 ng/dm(3), respectively). The concentrations of another 13 pharmaceuticals and metabolites exceeded 100 ng/dm(3), and the rest of the compounds were below 100 ng/dm(3). These water samples underwent ozonation in intervals of 0-10 min. The flow of ozone during the test was 50 mg O-3/min. The results show that the removal of pharmaceuticals is significant after the first minute of ozonation, when most of the studied compounds were below the limit of quantification. The total concentration of the studied compounds after the first minute decreased to 190 ng/dm(3) (97.2% removal efficiency). More than 99% removal efficiency was achieved after 10 min of ozonation.

AB In this study, a binary mixture in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction was used for the preconcentration and determination of selected pesticides, pharmaceutical and hormone by GC-MS. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to optimize the amounts of binary mixture, dispersive solvent and salt. The optimum parameters obtained were dichloromethane/1,2-dichloroethane binary mixture (200 mu L), ethanol (2.0 mL) and potassium nitrate (1.0 g). Analytical performance of each analyte was determined under the optimum conditions and the lowest and highest detection limits calculated were 0.43 and 5.9 ng/mL. Low relative standard deviations were obtained even in the lowest concentrations in linear calibration plots, signifying high precision for the sample preparation procedure and instrumental measurement. Accuracy of the developed method and applicability to real samples was tested on well, lake, hospital and municipal wastewater. The percent recoveries acquired at different spiked concentrations were satisfactory (89%-108%), validating the accuracy of the method for the quantification of the analytes in the selected matrices.

AB Biofilm reactors are a promising biotechnology to eliminate pharmaceuticals from wastewater during tertiary treatment or in water works for drinking water production. This study aimed at investigating the effects of pulsed carbon feeding for promoting the co-degradation of indigenous pharmaceuticals from pre-treated wastewater in a fixed-bed porous biofilm reactor (slow sand filter). The addition of acetate (carbon source) resulted in three different enhancement/limitation effects, which were compound dependent: 1) atenolol and iohexol experienced enhanced co-degradation followed by constant (acetate independent) degradation; 2) metoprolol, iomeprol, diclofenac, propranolol and sulfamethizole co-degradation dependent on aerobic turnover, but inhibited at higher acetate concentrations (60 -300 mg C/L); 3) sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed independently of oxygen and acetate concentration. Carbamazepine, ditriazoic acid, iopromide; tramadol and venlavaxine were not removed at any acetate dosage. Biofilm reactors can be employed for polishing treated wastewater, and the addition of a primary carbon source can enhance the performance of the bioreactor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A solar homo/heterogeneous photo-Fenton process using five materials (Fe(II), Fe(III), mining waste, Fe(II)/mining waste, and Fe(III)/mining waste) supported on sodium alginate was used as a strategy to iron dosage for the degradation of eight pharmaceuticals in three different water matrices (distilled water, simulated wastewater, and hospital wastewater). Experiments were carried out in a photoreactor with a capacity of 1L, using 3g of iron-alginate spheres and an initial hydrogen peroxide concentration of 25mgL(-1), at pH 5.0. All the materials prepared were characterized by different techniques. The Fe(III)-alginate spheres presented the best pharmaceutical degradation after a treatment time of 116min. Nineteen transformation products generated during the solar photo-Fenton process were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, using a purpose-built database developed for detecting these transformation products. Finally, the transformation products identified were classified according to their toxicity and predicted biodegradability.

AB The radiation-induced removal of sulphadiazine (SD) belonging to the heterocyclic sulphonamides pharmaceuticals was investigated by gamma irradiation at different conditions in laboratory scale. The influence of initial SD concentrations, pH values, O-2 and N-2 on SD degradation was determined. The experimental results showed that gamma-ray irradiation was efficient for removing SD from wastewater. SD could be completely removed at an absorbed dose of 10kGy. The degradation kinetics of SD conformed to the first-order kinetic equation. When SD concentration was in the range of 10-30mg/L, the dose constant (d) decreased with an increasing initial SD concentration. The mineralization of SD, in terms of total organic carbon removal, was not obvious at a low absorbed dose, but it increased to more than 75% at 100kGy. The biodegradability of SD was improved after irradiation, suggesting that irradiation could be used as a pretreatment technology for treating SD-containing wastewater. The possible degradation pathway of SD was tentatively proposed based on the analysis of intermediate products during gamma irradiation.

AB Olive mill wastewater (OMW) contains a substantial amount of valuable antioxidant phenols that can be recovered for industrial application as food additives and pharmaceuticals. The present study was aimed at extracting different phenolic OMW fractions, and determining their antioxidant potential. Five different OMW fractions were obtained using fractionation techniques, their antioxidant potential determined by DPPH, ORAC and a beta-carotene bleaching test. The total phenol level ranged between 115 and 170 mg/l. The phenolic compounds present in individual fractions were identified using the HPLC-PAD method, where the main compounds were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The five OMW fractions showed different antioxidant levels depending on the test used. DPPH test showed that the fraction of alkyl aromatic alcohols (AAAs) was the best with EC50 of 20 mg/l and the pure hydroxytyrosol with 2 mg/l. ORAC test showed that AAA and semi hydrolysed total phenol (s-TP) fractions were significantly better than Trolox when compared to 20 mg/l of Trolox. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The low-level presence of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the environment has raised a great concern due to their persistence, chronic toxicological, and endocrine disrupting effects on terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have become hotspots for the spread of these contaminants to the environment as conventional processes are not efficient in removing them. Thus, the integration of advanced treatment methods within the chain of WWTPs is very essential. In this study, the innovative hybrid process USAMe (R) which integrates ultrasound irradiation (US), adsorption (A) and membrane filtration (Me) was investigated for the removal of ECs from secondary effluents. Diclofenac, carbamazepine, and amoxicillin were selected due to their large consumption and frequent presence in the aquatic environment. All three ECs were spiked into real secondary wastewater effluent at two concentrations of 10 ppm and 100 ppb. Membrane ultrafiltration and its combination with US (USMe) or adsorption (AMe) were also studied as control tests. The hybrid combination of all the three methods in the USAMe (R) processes elevated the EC removals to above 99% as compared to only around 90% in the AMe process. All effluents of the hybrid USAMe (R) processes gave "No Effect" to D. magna, with immobilization of <= 20%. Therefore, results showed that the USAMe (R) process was efficient in not only removing ECs, but also in generating safe and less toxic treated effluents; thereby displaying its potential as an advanced method for wastewater treatment.

AB This study reports the first comprehensive data set of characteristic concentrations of four artificial sweeteners: acesulfame (ACE), sucralose (SUC), saccharin (SAC), and cyclamate (CYC), and their ratios with nutrients, for untreated septic system wastewater. Samples were collected from the tanks of 19 different septic systems from across Ontario, Canada; these had a variety of usages, from single-family cottages to multiple-dwelling (campground or resort) facilities and had no additional treatment systems. The artificial sweetener concentrations and their relative proportions were highly variable in some cases, both temporally for several individual tanks and from site-to-site. Variability tended to be lower for multiple-dwelling compared to single-dwelling systems. This variability likely reflects differing use of artificial sweetener-containing products. The median concentrations for the complete data set of all four artificial sweeteners (in a range of 10 to 60 g/L) were of a similar order of magnitude, but slightly higher, than has generally been reported for wastewater treatment plant influent (though these vary substantially globally). Both SUC and ACE provided adequate positive linear relationships for dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the septic tanks, while a summation of ACE and SUC concentrations also gave a strong correlation. In contrast, CYC and SAC showed poor linear correlation with these nutrients. These reported ranges for artificial sweetener concentrations and ratios with nutrients may be used in future studies to estimate the contributions of nutrients or other wastewater constituents (e.g., pharmaceuticals, bacteria, and viruses) from domestic septic systems to groundwater, including water supply or irrigation wells, and nearby surface water bodies.

AB An unique up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater at various organic loading rate (OLR) was investigated and showed efficient substrate removal at low OLRs (0.43-1.86 kg COD m(-3)d(-1)) by promoting efficient chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (70-75%). However, increasing the OLRs to 3.73 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) (4-2 d) reduced :he COD removal efficiency (45%). Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis showed that the microbial community of the reactor stages was dominated by methanogenic archaea (56-79% of 4',6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells in all stages) when the reactor was fed at OLR 0.86-2.98 kg COD m(-3)d(-1) but decreased in Stage 1 (30% of DAPI-stained cells) when the OLR was at 3.73 kg COD m(-3)d(-1). The two methanogenic genera detected were Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta. Generally, Methanosaeta dominated the reactor stages when the OLR was 0.86-1.86 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), while Methanosarcina dominated during the period of high OLR (2.98-3.73 kg COD m(-3)d(-1)). Based on the number of Desulfovibrio cells detected (8-36% of the total eubacteria) in all stages during the entire operation of the reactor, it appears that sulfidogenic bacteria contributed to the overall degradation of organic substances in the pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB In this work, we investigated the transport and burial of triclosan and its methylated derivative, in surface sediments near the mouth of Barker Inlet in South Australia. The most likely source of this commonly used bactericide to the area is a wastewater outfall discharging at the confluence of the inlet with marine waters. Triclosan was detected in all samples, at concentrations (5-27 mu g kg(-1)) comparable to values found in other surface sediments under the influence of marine wastewater outfalls. Its dispersal was closely associated with fine and organic-rich fractions of the sediments. Methyl-triclosan was detected in approximately half of the samples at concentrations < 11 mu g kg(-1). The occurrence of this compound was linked to both wastewater discharges and biological methylation of the parent compound. Wastewater-borne methyl-triclosan had a smaller spatial footprint than triclosan and was mostly deposited in close proximity to the outfall. In situ methylation of triclosan likely occurs at deeper depositional sites, whereas the absence of methyl-triclosan from shallower sediments was potentially explained by photodegradation of the parent compound. Based on partition equilibrium, a concentration of triclosan in the order of 1 mu g L(-1) was estimated in sediment porewaters, a value lower than the threshold reported for harmful effects to occur in the couple of species of marine phytoplankton investigated to date. Methyl-triclosan presents a greater potential for bioaccumulation than triclosan, but the implications of its occurrence to aquatic ecosystem health are difficult to predict given the lack of ecotoxicological data in the current literature.

TI Effective organics degradation from pharmaceutical wastewater by an

ID 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOL
AB The enhanced removal of organic compounds from a pharmaceutical wastewater resulting from the production of an anti-viral drug (acyclovir) was obtained by employing a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and an ozonation system. Art integrated MBR-ozonation system was set-up by placing the ozonation reactor in the recirculation stream of the MBR effluent. A conventional treatment set-up (ozonation as polishing step after MBR) was also used as a reference. The biological treatment alone reached an average COD removal of 99%, which remained unvaried when the ozonation step was introduced. An acyclovir removal of 99% was also obtained with the MBR step and the ozonation allowed to further remove 99% of the residual concentration in the MBR effluent. For several of the 28 organics identified in the wastewater the efficiency of the MBR treatment improved from 20% to 60% as soon as the ozonation was placed in the recirculation stream. The benefit of the integrated system, with respect to the conventional treatment set-up was evident for the removal of a specific ozonation by-product. The latter was efficiently removed in the integrated system, being its abundance in the final effluent 20-fold lower than what obtained when ozonation was used as a polishing step. In addition, if the conventional treatment configuration is employed, the same performance of the integrated system in terms of by-product removal can only be obtained when the ozonation is operated for longer than 60 min. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the integrated system compared to the conventional polishing configuration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study a novel iron-based reducing agent of highly effective reduction toward nitrobenzene (NB) was obtained by pretreating zero valent iron (ZVI) with H2O2/HCl. During the H2O2/HCl pretreatment, ZVI undergoes an intensive corrosion process with formation of various reducing corrosion products (e.g., Fe2+, ferrous oxides/hydroxides, Fe3O4), yielding a synergetic system (prtZVl) including liquid, suspensions and solid phase. The pretreatment process remarkably enhances the reductive performance of ZVI, where a rapid reduction of NB (200 mgL(-1)) in the prtZVl suspension was accomplished in a broad pH range (3-9) and at low dosage. Nitrosobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine are identified as the intermediates for NB reduction with the end-product of aniline. Compared with the virgin ZVI as well as another nanosized ZVI, the prtZVl system exhibits much higher electron efficiency for NB reduction as well as higher utilization ratio of Fe-0 A rapid reduction of various nitroaromatics in an actual pharmaceutical wastewater further demonstrated the feasibility of the prtZVl system in real wastewater treatment.

AB Simultaneous Escherichia coli inactivation and oxidation of pharmaceuticals in simulated wastewater treatment plant effluents has been investigated using a photocatalytic treatment with TiO2 in suspension and immobilised onto a fixed-bed reactor. Non-photocatalytic reference experiments of dark adsorption and photolysis showed a higher sensitivity of E. coli towards the chemical composition of water in comparison with the concentration of pharmaceuticals that remains unaffected. Moreover, it must be underlined that the presence of pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics) did not seem to affect the bacterial viability at such low concentrations. Concerning photocatalytic experiments, both suspended and immobilised TiO2 were able to simultaneously inactivate and oxidise both kinds of pollutants (bacteria and pharmaceuticals). The fixed-bed reactor showed similar activity to that of the slurry without deactivation after several cycles of reuse. That makes TiO2 photocatalysis a quite interesting technology for the treatment of drinking water supplies or wastewater plant effluents, allowing the removal of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals during the disinfection treatment.

AB A variety of emerging chemicals of concern are released continuously to surface water through the municipal wastewater effluent discharges. The ability to rapidly determine bioaccumulation of these contaminants in exposed fish without sacrificing the animal (i.e. in vivo) would be of significant advantage to facilitate research, assessment and monitoring of their risk to the environment. In this study, an in vivo solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) approach was developed and applied to the measurement of a variety of emerging contaminants (carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bisphenol A, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and atrazine) in fish. Our results indicated in vivo SPME was a potential alternative extraction technique for quantitative determination of contaminants in lab exposures and as well after exposure to two municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), with a major advantage over conventional techniques due to its ability to non-lethally sample tissues of living organisms.

AB This study presents the development of an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of multiclass illicit drugs (cocainoids, opiates, amphetamines, and cannabinoids) and psychoactive pharmaceuticals (anxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiparkinsonian), in municipal wastewater. The analytical method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision, and accuracy. The recoveries (%) for the majority of the analytes ranged between 70 and 120%, while the method showed good repeatability (2.4-29.2%). The limits of detection (LOD) of the method ranged between 0.8 and 9.4 ng L-1. The method was implemented on influent and effluent samples from Thessaloniki (N. Greece) wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and it revealed the daily presence of benzoylecgonine (BEG) (84.0-202.2 ng L-1), methadone (12.3-17.5 ng L-1), 11-Nor-9-carboxy-Delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) (80.3-171.9 ng L-1), morphine (144.2-264.3 ng L-1), and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) (5.8-12.0 ng L-1) in the influent samples of WWTP. Clozapine (101.6-315.5 ng L-1), quetiapine (33.5-109.7 ng L-1), and fluoxetine (20.9-124.4 ng L-1) were pharmaceutical psychotics with the highest concentration in the influents. Back calculation estimated that the daily consumption of cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and methadone was 36-95, 86-164, 2300-5400, and 8-12 mg day(-1) per 1000 inhabitants, respectively. The consumption was estimated between 7-16 and 15 mg day(-1) per 1000 inhabitants for methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), respectively.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of UV-absorbance and fluorescence as monitoring tools for ozone dosages applied to effluents from wastewater treatment plans (WWTPs). Secondary treated effluents from five Swedish WWTPs underwent ozonation (at dosages ranging 0.5-12.0 mg O-3/L) in bench-scale experiments. Correlations between ozone dosages and UV-absorbance at 254 and 272 nm were extrapolated with the first one being preferential for the wastewaters used because of its higher signal. UV-absorbance could detect differences in the applied ozone dosage as low as 1 mg/L, making it suitable to monitor effluent ozone treatment processes. Next, fluorescence was investigated at wavelength transitions that have being associated with humic-like fluorescents (Ex249Em450 and Ex335Em450) and protein-like fluorescents (Ex275Em340 and Ex231Em360 and Ex231Em315 and Ex275Em310). The Ex249Em450 transition was found to have the highest signal in all effluents and the best linear regression fitting with the ozone dosages over a wide range. However, low ozone dosages (0.5-3.0 mg O-3/L), Ex335Em450 wavelength transition showed a more constant slope among the different domestic wastewater samples with slightly better R-2 values than the Ex249Em450 transition. Fluorescence removal via ozonation correlated with the pharmaceutical removal; however, the wellness of fitting was directly dependent on the pharmaceuticals' reactivity with ozone. Pharmaceuticals with moderate reactivity towards ozone appeared to be linearly correlated with the Ex249Em450 transition, while very reactive or recalcitrant pharmaceuticals had an exponential or a parabolic dependency. This means that fluorescence can potentially be used as a qualitative tool for pharmaceutical removal.

AB Atenolol (ATL) has been widely detected in wastewater and aquatic environment. Although satisfactory removal of ATL from wastewater could be achieved, the mineralization ratio is usually low, which may result in the accumulation of its transformation products in the effluent and cause additional ecological risk to the environment. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of heat activated persulfate (PS) in the removal of ATL from wastewater. Influencing factors including temperature, PS dosage, solution pH, existence of NO3-,Cl-,HCO(3)( )(-)and Suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA) were examined. Complete removal of ATL was achieved within 40 min at pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C by using 0.5 mM PS. Inhibitive effects of HCO3- and FA had been observed on ATL oxidation, which was increased with the increase of their concentration. Sulfate radical (SO4-center dot) was determined as the main reactive species by quenching experiment. Eight intermediates produced in ATL degradation were identified, and four degradation pathways were proposed based on the analysis of mass spectrum and frontier electron densities. The distribution of major intermediates was influenced by reaction temperature. Hydroxylation intermediates and deamidation intermediate were the most prominent at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. All intermediates were completely degraded in 40 min except P134 at 70 degrees C. Effective removal of TOC (74.12%) was achieved with 0.5 mM PS, pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C after 240 min. The results proved that heat activation of PS is a promising method to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Discharges of care, analyses and research activities from hospital wards are the source of the specificity of hospital effluents because they contain, among others, drug residues, detergents and disinfectants. Even if hospitals represent a small fraction of the total drug load discharged into the environment, below 10% for drugs, the characterization of this specific effluent shows that global pollution is 2-3 times more concentrated than urban wastewater. Moreover this ratio increases to 150 times for some micropollutants. Activated sludge acclimation in 2 membrane bioreactor (MBR) configurations (external and external submerged) to effluents from an oncological ward will be studied monitoring the performances on conventional pollution parameters (chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, total suspended solids etc.). The performances of drug degradation are compared with the data of the literature and with degradation tests in batch reactor with no acclimated biomass from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The results are achieved for effluents with a high concentration of drug molecules, up to 6.82 mg L-1 for ifosfamide. The treatment allows the development of enhanced purification efficiencies on drug molecules and confirms the choice of a MBR process to treat this effluent, although the simultaneous presence of the various compounds leads to a complex biological response. Indeed, 5-FU was eliminated almost systematically over 90%. Sulfamethoxazole and codeine can be significantly eliminated biologically, respectively to 79 and 95%. IF and CP removal in the reactor appeared more moderate since it does not exceed 40% but membrane fouling led to higher removals of both molecules.

AB Environmental pollution by pharmaceutical residues has become a major problem in many countries worldwide. However, little is known about the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water sources in Tunisia. Residues in the natural environment have been of increasing concern due to their impact on bacteria resistance development and toxicity to natural communities and ultimately to public health. In this work, we collected the wastewater sample from a pharmaceutical industry, which specializes in the antibiotics manufacture, during the years 2014-2015. Generally, this effluent is discharged into the marine environment and causes environmental problems. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was commonly used as a model organism for its peculiar morphofunctional properties which also make it an excellent marine environmental biomonitoring species. The histological sections of mussel, which are exposed at different dilutions of pharmaceutical wastewater (PW), indicate a large pathological power revealed on the gills. On the other hand, genotoxicity of the studied effluent was evaluated using comet assay for quantification of DNA fragmentation in gill cells. Results show that PW exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.001) genotoxic effect in a dose-dependent manner. However, the toxic effects of PW decreased significantly after its treatment with Bacillus atrophaeus. Toxicities can be imputed to the presence of antibiotics. In fact, chemical analysis of the gills of mussel M. galloprovincialis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) showed the presence of some antibiotic residues. These concentrations decrease to half in mussels treated with PW biodegraded by B. atrophaeus.

AB The degradation of two organic pollutants (amoxicillin and diclofenac) in 0.1 mM aqueous solutions was studied by using advanced oxidation processes, namely ozonation, photolysis, photolytic ozonation, photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation. Diclofenac was degraded quickly under direct photolysis by artificial light (medium-pressure vapor arc, lambda(exc) > 300 nm), while amoxicillin remained very stable. In the presence of ozone, regardless of the type of process, complete degradation of both organic pollutants was observed in less than 20 min. Photolysis or ozonation on their own led to modest values of total organic carbon (TOC) removal (<6% or 41%, respectively in 180 min), while for photocatalysis (no ozone present) a significant fraction of nonoxidizable compounds remained in the treated water (similar to 15% after 180 min). In the case of photolytic ozonation, the kinetics of TOC removal was slow.
   In contrast, a relatively fast and complete mineralization of amoxicillin and diclofenac (30 and 120 min, respectively) was achieved when applying the photocatalytic ozonation process. The absence of toxicity of the treated waters was confirmed by growth inhibition assays using two different microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Photocatalytic ozonation was also applied to an urban wastewater spiked with both amoxicillin and diclofenac. The parent pollutants were easily oxidized, but the TOC removal was only as much as 68%, mainly due to the persistent presence of oxamic acid in the treated sample. The same treatment allowed the effective degradation of a wide group of micropollutants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones and an industrial compound) detected in non-spiked urban wastewater.

AB This work addresses the problem of micropollutants removal in sewage treatment plants trying to identify the main factors influencing their fate and behaviour. Firstly the most significant groups of substances that are continuously emitted into the environment are presented and the physico-chemical properties and biodegradability of representative compounds are discussed. This information is crucial to understand the main removal mechanisms occurring in sewage treatment plants, such as sorption, biodegradation and chemical transformation, as well as the distribution pathways of micropollutants once released into the environment. Selected case studies are discussed to identify some key operational factors which influence the removal of these compounds. including the use of additives, temperature, biomass concentration and characteristics (microbial diversity, structure, etc.), as well as hydraulic and sludge retention time. A discussion focused on comparison of data corresponding to several configurations of activated sludge systems and membrane biological reactors is presented. So far, it is not clear how the type of technology affects micropollutants removal. A number of conclusions trying to explain the influence of different factors and some guidelines useful to enhance the removal of micropollutants in sewage treatment plants are presented.
   Organic micropollutants refer to a wide group of carbon containing chemical compounds, mainly of xenobiotic nature, created by industrial processes either intentionally or as by-products, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, plasticizers, perfluorinated compounds, etc. Some of these substances are being considered for inclusion in the list of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), i.e. compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through biological, chemical or photochemical processes, thus capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulation in human and animal tissue, biomagnification in food chains, and exerting potential significant impacts on human health and the environment (Katsoyiannis and Samara 2007; Clarke et al. 2008; Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 2009). Moreover, a significant number of these substances, those defined as Endocrine Disrupting compounds (EDCs), may exert estrogenic activity on various higher organisms (Kester et al. 2000).
   During the last decade, the focus of environmental research has been extended from the more "classic" POPs such as organochlorine pesticides or Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) to the so called "emerging contaminants" such as Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs). Recent advances in analytical techniques, mainly related to the increasing use of Liquid Chromatography (LC) coupled with Mass Spectrometry (MS), have enabled the possibility of determining a wide variety of micropollutants which, although denoted as "emerging" because information about Occurrence is fairly recent, have been discharged into the environment along decades, mainly in water bodies (Ternes 2007). That is the case of PPCPs or the most recently reported Perfluorinated Alkylated substances (PFAs), a large group of chemicals widely used to create inert surfaces for different industrial and consumer products since the 1950s, but recently detected in waste dumps or sewage (Clara et al. 2008). Although these compounds are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, either as sole compounds or also when present as components of complex mixtures.
   The objective of this chapter is to present the main removal mechanisms that take place throughout Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), since municipal wastewaters represent a significant emission source of micropollutants (Neumann et al. 2002; Joss et al. 2005). Most of the existing units operate with variations of the well known Activated Sludge (AS) process. However, one innovative technology that is nowadays gaining Popularity is the Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR). Postreatment Methods. Such as activated carbon or through ozone or advanced oxidation technologies, although very interesting as a polishing step leading to almost complete removal of these substances, can be considered as an "externality" of the common primary-secondary treatment, and are not discussed in this chapter.

AB The detection of anti-cancer drugs in surface waters at ng/L indicates that most wastewater treatment processes currently applied are not effective enough to remove these resilient compounds from wastewater. Therefore alternative treatment processes should be tested to avoid discharges in the environment of drugs that have been linked to genotoxic effects. The innovative contribution of this study stands in coupling nanofiltration with advanced oxidation processes to treat real secondary wastewater effluents spiked with 4 widely consumed anticancer drugs. Direct photolysis was found to be extremely effective to degrade etoposide and paclitaxel from the secondary effluent as well as from the highly concentrated retentate produced by nanofiltration. The two drugs were not detected after 10 min of exposure that corresponds to higher than 98% removals given the method detection limits by direct injection. This is equivalent to pseudo-first order degradation rate constants higher than 0.46 min(-1), which, to the best of the author's knowledge, has not yet been reported for paclitaxel in the literature. However, none of the tested oxidation processes (UV, UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2) using the reactor setup, exposure times and concentrations of TiO2 and H2O2 tested, were able to degrade cyclophosphamide or ifos-famide effectively. Compared to literature data, this is probably related to the low amount of photons received by the treated media. Finally important aggregation of catalyst particles was observed in secondary effluent, and photocatalysis had no advantage compared to the other two processes tested.

AB Duloxetine (DUL), an antidepressant drug, has been detected in surface water and wastewater effluents, however, there is little information on the formation of its transformation products (TPs). In this work, hydrolysis, photodegradation (UV irradiation) and chlorination experiments were performed on spiked distillated water, under controlled experimental conditions to simulate abiotic processes that can occur in the environment andwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Eleven TPs, nine from reaction with UV light and two from chlorine contact, were formed and detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and nine of them had their chemical structures elucidated upon analyses of their fragmentation patterns in MS/MS spectra. The formation and degradation of the TPs were observed. The parent compound was completely degraded after 30 min in photodegradation and after 24 hr in chlorination. Almost all TPs were completely degraded in the experiments. The ecotoxicity and mutagenicity of the TPs were predicted based on several in silico models and it was found that a few of these products presented more ecotoxicity than DUL itself and six TPs showed positive mutagenicity. Finally, wastewater samples were analyzed and DUL and one TP, possibly formed by chlorination process, were detected in the effluent, which showed that WWTP not only did not remove DUL, but also formed a TP.

AB We quantified pesticide contamination and its ecological impact up- and downstream of seven wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in rural and suburban areas of central Germany. During two sampling campaigns, time-weighted average pesticide concentrations (c-(TWA)) were obtained using Chemcatche (R) passive samplers; pesticide peak concentrations were quantified with event-driven samplers. At downstream sites, receiving waters were additionally grab sampled for five selected pharmaceuticals. Ecological effects on macroinvertebrate structure and ecosystem function were assessed using the biological indicator system SPEAR(pesticides) (SPEcies At Risk) and leaf litter breakdown rates, respectively. WWTP effluents substantially increased insecticide and fungicide concentrations in receiving waters; in many cases, treated wastewater was the exclusive source for the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid in the investigated streams. During the ten weeks of the investigation, five out of the seven WWTPs increased in-stream pesticide toxicity by a factor of three. As a consequence, at downstream sites, SPEAR values and leaf litter degradation rates were reduced by 40% and 53%, respectively. The reduced leaf litter breakdown was related to changes in the macroinvertebrate communities described by SPEARpesticides and not to altered microbial activity. Neonicotinoids showed the highest ecological relevance for the composition of invertebrate communities, occasionally exceeding the Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RACs). In general, considerable ecological effects of insecticides were observed above and below regulatory thresholds. Fungicides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals contributed only marginally to acute toxicity. We conclude that pesticide retention of WWTPs needs to be improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an effective treatment technology for the removal of a variety of organic pollutants in both water and wastewater treatment. However, many background constituents in water are highly reactive towards hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) and decrease the efficiency of the process towards contaminant oxidation. Up to 95% of the HO center dot scavenging can come from dissolved organic matter (OM). In this study, 28 wastewater effluent samples were analyzed to find correlations between the reactivity of HO center dot with wastewater-derived OM (known as effluent organic matter, EfOM), water quality parameters, treatment train characteristics, and fluorescence-derived data. Rate constants for the reaction between HO center dot and EfOM (k(EfOM-HO)) were measured using a bench scale UV-based AOP system with methylene blue as an HO center dot probe and confirmed using an electron pulse radiolysis method for a subset of the samples. The EfOM was characterized using a series of physicochemical parameters, including polarity, average molecular size and fluorescence. The kinetic data were analyzed with principal component analysis and Akaike Information Criterion. Four predictors were identified as dominant: chemical oxygen demand, retention onto NH2 extraction medium, fluorescence index, and total organic carbon. These four variables accounted for approximately 62% of the variability in the value of k(EfOM-HO) The average k(EfOM-HO) value for EfOM in this study was 2.5 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1), which is about 31% lower than the 3.6 x 10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1) value determined for natural organic matter isolates and commonly used in AOP modeling.

AB A comparative study of ultrasonication (US), Fenton's oxidation (FO) and ferro-sonication (FS) (combination of ultrasonication and Fenton's oxidation) advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) from wastewater (WW) is reported for the first time. CBZ is a worldwide used antiepileptic drug, found as a persistent emerging contaminant in many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents and other aquatic environments. The oxidation treatments of WW caused an effective removal of the drug. Among the various US, FO and FS pre-treatments carried out, higher soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and soluble organic carbon (SOC) increment (63 to 86% and 21 to 34%, respectively) was observed during FO pre-treatment process, resulting in higher removal of CBZ (84 to 100%) from WW. Furthermore, analysis of by-products formed during US, FO and FS pre-treatment in WW was carried out by using laser diode thermal desorption-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LDTD-APCI) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LDTD-APCI-MS/MS analysis indicated formation of two by-products, such as epoxycarbamazepine and hydroxycarbamazepine due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH-) with CBZ during the three types of pre-treatment processes. In addition, the estrogenic activity of US, FO and FS pre-treated sample with CBZ and its by-products was carried out by Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) assay method. Based upon the YES test results, none of the pre-treated samples showed estrogenic activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The expanding amount of remaining drug substances in wastewater adversely affects both the climate and human well-being. In the current investigation, we developed new cellulose acetic acid derivation/zeolite fiber as an effective technique to eliminate erythromycin (ERY) from wastewater. The number of interchangeable sites in the adsorbent structures and the ratio of ERY to the three adsorbents were identified as the main reasons for the reduction in adsorption as the initial ERY concentrations increased. Additionally, for all adsorbents, the pseudo-second-order modeling showed better fitting for the adsorption than the pseudo-first-order modeling. However, the findings obtained in the pseudo-first-order model were still enough for explaining the sorption kinetics of ERY, showing that the surface displayed all chemisorption and physi-sorption adsorption processes by both adsorbents. The R (2) for the second order was very close to 1 for the three adsorbents in the case of pseudo-second-order. The adsorption capacity reached 17.76 mg/g. The three adsorbents showed negative values of Delta H, and these values were -6,200, -8,500, and -9600 kJ/mol for zeolite, CA, and ZCA, respectively, and this shows that the adsorption is exothermic. The desorption analysis shows no substantial loss of adsorption site after three trials, indicating higher stability and resilience of the three adsorbents, indicating a strong repeatability of their possible use in adsorption without contaminating the environment. In addition, the chemical attitude and possible donor-acceptor interactions of ERY were assessed by the quantum chemical parameters (QCPs) and NBO analysis performed, at the HF/6-311G** calculations.

AB The pharmaceutical torasemide is an important loop diuretic and was 2017 one of the ten most prescribed drugs in Germany. Despite its detection in different compartments of the urban water cycle including drinking water, no studies were so far performed to elucidate its fate in the environment and the occurrence of transformation products (TPs). Therefore, we investigated the phototransformation, microbial degradation, transformation with human liver microsomes and anodic oxidation of torasemide to obtain good coverage of environmentally relevant degradation products. Overall sixteen products were identified, covering the following reaction mechanisms: aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, including further oxidation to carboxylic acids and quinone imines, amide cleavage, N-dealkylation, N-dearylation, and sulfonamide hydrolysis to sulfonic acids. Especially the formation of quinone imines could be of concern as they are highly reactive electrophiles. Torasemide itself was observed in all investigated wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) samples and wastewater-impacted surface waters. The maximum detected concentration was about 350 ng L-1. Only three of the sixteen transformation products were generally observed in at least one of the samples and the most frequently detected TPs were the human metabolites hydroxytorasemide (TP 364a) and carboxytorasemide (TP 378a). The complete removal of TP 364a during wastewater treatment was in agreement with the results of microbial degradation experiments. TP 364a was most likely transformed into TP 378a, which was microbially less degraded in lab experiments. Based on estimated concentrations, TP 378a could reach about 1 mu g L-1 in the investigated wastewater matrices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water pollution with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) is widespread in water bodies due to the low effectiveness of industrial and urban wastewater treatment systems. In recent decades, the implementation of vegetation-based wastewater treatment systems such as wetlands has been observed to help solve this issue. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the removal percentage attributable to plants and how plants affect this removal improvement. In this study, we monitored planted (Phragmites australis) and unplanted sand columns to assess the effect of vegetation on the attenuation of 5 well-known CECs (benzotriazole, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, bisphenol A, and diclofenac) and link it to the presence of different root exudates. The columns were operated in a continuous feeding mode for more than 6 months at 3 hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) (70, 140, and 280 mm d(-1)). We found that the presence of vegetation increased CEC attenuation from no effect to more than 200% compared to the unplanted columns. The highest effect was observed for carbamazepine (94-200%), followed by diclofenac (22-171%), benzotriazole (48-127%), and sulfamethoxazole (no effect to 43%), depending on the tested HLR. Furthermore, the greater CEC attenuation in planted columns was linked to the release of certain root exudates that may shape the root microbiome. We expect our assay to be a starting point for exploring the role of root exudates in enhancing CEC removal efficiency in wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibiotic resistance has become a global problem as indicated by the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which makes it an urgent demand to develop effective technologies for antibiotics removal from pharmaceutical wastewater. In this work, simultaneously removing antibiotic tetracycline from wastewater coupled with pure H-2 generation has been successfully achieved through PEC technique by using F-doped BiVO4@NiFe-LDH (F-BiVO4@NiFe-LDH) core-shell photoanode. The maximum photocurrent density of the F-BiVO4@NiFe-LDH photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE is about 6-fold that of the pristine BiVO4 photoelectrode. Furthermore, the composite photoanode was effectively applied to the PEC degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), superior to the reported results. An experimental-computational combination study reveals that the synergistic effect between F doping and NiFe-LDH simultaneously improves the light absorption, charge separation and charge injection efficiency of BiVO4. This work presents a sunlight-driven, efficient and sustainable method for water splitting to produce hydrogen and new insights into wastewater treatment.

AB Biological effects of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents were investigated in Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) caged for one month 800 m and 1100 m from the WWTP discharge site and at a reference site 4 km away. Significant antioxidant, genotoxic and lysosomal responses were observed close to the point of the WWTP discharge. Passive samplers (POCIS) attached to the cages indicated markedly higher water concentrations of various pharmaceuticals at the two most impacted sites. Modeling the dispersal of a hypothetical passive tracer compound from the WWTP discharge site revealed differing frequencies and timing of the exposure periods at different caging sites. The study demonstrated for the first time the effectiveness of the mussel caging approach in combination with passive samplers and the application of passive tracer modeling to examine the true exposure patterns at point source sites such as WWTP pipe discharges in the Baltic Sea.

AB This paper investigates the biodegradability of wastewaters originating from a paracetamol active ingredients production factory. Experimental biodegradability tests are performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In this pharmaceutical plant, approximately 1 m(3) of wastewater is generated per ton paracetamol produced. According to the results of conventional characterization, a strong wastewater that is almost totally soluble in nature is produced. ED50 value for raw effluent is determined to be 6.7 % at 30 mm showing significant toxicity towards the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Aerobic and anaerobic treatment alternatives are comparatively evaluated in terms of the lowest achievable COD levels after biotreatment. Aerobic treatment yields a residual COD of 355 mg/L. The discharge standards of 600 mg/L can be complied with the usage of an aerobic treatment unit. Application of anaerobic treatment, on the other hand, is not efficient in removing organics from these effluents. Almost up to 87 % of the COD is recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions resulting in around 16000 mg/L of COD at the outlet of anaerobic treatment. Therefore, aerobic treatment must be favoured over anaerobic one before discharging these effluents to the sewerage system.

AB Removal of antibiotics by reverse osmosis/nanofiltration (RO/NF) from a model wastewater of a manufacturing plant producing pharmaceuticals for veterinary use was investigated. The rejection of the examined antibiotics by the selected RO and the tight NF membranes is acceptably high, exceeding in most cases 98.5%. The loose NF membrane retains the smaller antibiotics molecules less effective. Relating the solute rejections to the membranes' porosity has shown that the prevailing rejection mechanism of the examined antibiotics by all the membranes was the size exclusion effect. The rejection of the low molecular organic compounds by all the examined membranes is lower, ranging from 0.517 to 0.976 for the RO and tight NF membranes, and from 0.247 to 0.506 for the loose NF membrane. The rejections also follow the order of the solutes' molecular size. However, the specific physicochemical effects can influence the rejection of some low molecular organics by the examined membranes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The target compounds were analysed using developed offline solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC-PDA) method. All the five PPCPs were found in the influent, whereas four were found in the effluent of the STP. However, in the surface water bodies, three PPCPs were detected in all the seasons. Above PPCPs were present in the concentration range of 1-174 mu g L-1 in the surface water bodies, 12373 mu g L-1 in the influent and 11-233 mu g L-1 in the effluent of the STP. Amongst the five PPCPs, caffeine was found to be in higher concentration as compared to others. The seasonal trends indicate higher concentrations of PPCPs in summer season and lowest in the rainy season. Additionally, physico-chemical characterisations (inorganic and organic parameters) of the collected samples were performed to access the anthropogenic pollution. Ecotoxicological risk assessment was done to appraise the degree of toxicity of the targeted compounds. Hazard quotient (HQ) values were found to be < 1 indicating no adverse effect on the targeted organism.

AB A model was developed to assess the impact of adding acids and bases to processed municipal sewage sludge (MSS) to mobilize contaminants, facilitating their removal from sludge by flushing prior to land application. Among 312 organic contaminants documented to occur in U.S. MSS, 71 or 23% were identified as ionizable organic contaminants (IOCs), contributing a disproportionately large fraction of 82% of the total mass of sludge borne contaminants. Detected IOCs included 57 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, 12 perfluorinated compounds, one surfactant and one pesticide. Annually, about 2000 t of IOCs were estimated to be released to U.S. soils via land-application of MSS. A partitioning model developed to assess the impact of pH on hydrophobic sorption revealed that between 36 and 85% of the mass of individual classes of IOCs potentially could be desorbed from MSS via pH adjustment and flushing. Thus, modeling results suggest that a sequential pH treatment [acidic (similar to pH 2) followed by basic (similar to pH 12) treatment] has the potential to reduce the burden of harmful IOCs in MSS applied on U.S. land by up to 40 +/- 16 t annually. This approach may serve as a cost-effective treatment process that can be implemented easily in existing sludge treatment infrastructure in the U.S. and worldwide, serving to significantly improve the quality of MSS destined for land application.

Results showed no observable reduction of carbamazepine by either anaerobic or aerobic biofilms over a dosing period of 51-days followed by an additional 23 days of observation. Caffeine, by contrast, was reduced by 11.09% in the upflow anaerobic packed bed biofilm reactor (UAnPBBR) and by 91.90% in the aerobic trickling filter biofilm reactor (TF). Estrone (E1) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) showed minimal reduction in the UAnPBBR but 99.67% reduction in the TF, while EE2 was reduced 1.62% in the AnPBBR and 20.36% in the TF. On average, a 3-log reduction of E. coli (CN-13) and a 1-log reduction of F+ specific coliphage (MS2) concentration was observed across the overall reactor system.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the oestrogen and androgen hormone removal efficiency of reactive (Connelly zero-valent iron (ZVI), Gotthart Maier ZVI) and sorptive (AquaSorb 101 granular activated carbon (GAC) and OrganoLoc PM-100 organoclay (OC)) materials from HPLC grade water and constructed wetland system (CWS) treated dairy farm wastewater. Batch test studies were performed and hormone concentration analysis carried out using highly sensitive reporter gene assays (RGAs). The results showed that hormonal interaction with these materials is selective for individual classes of hormones. Connelly ZVI and AquaSorb 101 GAC were more efficient in removing testosterone (Te) than 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and showed faster removal rates of oestrogen and androgen than the other materials. Gotthart Maier ZVI was more efficient in removing E2 than Te. OrganoLoc PM-100 OC achieved the lowest final concentration of E2 equivalent (EEQ) and provided maximum removal of both oestrogens and androgens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2(AO-H2O2) was applied to treat 130 mL of antihypertensive drug captopril in sulfate medium, urban wastewater and synthetic urine using a BDD, Pt or IrO2 anode and an air-diffusion cathode. Oxidants were (OH)-O-center dot formed during O-2 evolution and active chlorine formed via anodic oxidation of Cl-. Drug removal decreased as: BDD > Pt > IrO2. The effect of pH and current density was examined. Further, 2.5 L of drug solutions in the same matrices with Fe2+ at pH 3.0 were treated by solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF) using a solar pre-pilot flow plant with a Pt/air-diffusion cell and a planar photoreactor. In sulfate medium, SPEF outperformed AO-H2O2 and electro-Fenton because of the efficient Fe3+ photoreduction. Low mineralization was achieved by the small generation of photoactive Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes. In urban wastewater, captopril was more rapidly removed due to active chlorine. Two heterocyclic derivatives and four aliphatic acids were detected.

AB Antibiotics are drugs used on both animals and humans. However, when their residues or metabolites are released into the environment, it can cause microbial resistance in water bodies, including wastewater treatment plants. In this study, extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were monitored in an anaerobic-aerobic combined biological treatment system. The enzymes Oxacillinase (OXA), Cefotaximases (CTX) and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) were added to the treatment and analyzed by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) and plate count using a selective medium. Quantification of the effect of adding these enzymes was performed before, during and after they were added in order to establish the behavior of the treatment system under three different conditions. Anaerobic reactors proved more efficient at treating wastewater containing the beta-lactamases OXA, CTX and NDM-1 than the ASP3 aerobic reactor that was working individually. However, an anaerobic-aerobic treatment train was much more effective at removing organic matter, even in the presence of beta-lactamase.

AB Pharmaceutical effluents released from industries are accountable to deteriorate the aquatic and soil environment through indirect toxic effects. Microbes are adequately been used to biodegrade pharmaceutical industry wastewater and present study was envisaged to determine biodegradation of pharmaceutical effluent by Micrococcus yunnanensis. The strain showed 42.82% COD (Chemical oxygen demand) reduction before optimization. After applying Taguchi's L8 array as an optimization technique, the biodegradation rate was enhanced by 82.95% at optimum conditions (dextrose- 0.15%, peptone 0.1%, inoculum size 4% (wv(-1)), rpm 200, pH 8 at 25 degrees C) within 6 h. The confirmation of pharmaceuticals degradation was done by H-1 NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) studies followed by elucidation of transformation pathways of probable drugs in the effluent through Q-Tof-MS (Quadrupole Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry). The cytotoxicity evaluation of treated and untreated wastewater was analyzed on Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cells using Alamar Blue assay, which showed significant variance.

AB Removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater during secondary treatment followed by reverse osmosis and UV disinfection was evaluated by a combination of four in-vitro cell-based bioassays and chemical analysis of 299 organic compounds. Concentrations detected in recycled water were below the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. Thus the detected chemicals were considered not to pose any health risk. The detected pesticides in the wastewater treatment plant effluent and partially advanced treated water explained all observed effects on photosynthesis inhibition. In contrast, mixture toxicity experiments with designed mixtures containing all detected chemicals at their measured concentrations demonstrated that the known chemicals explained less than 3% of the observed cytotoxicity and less than 1% of the oxidative stress response. Pesticides followed by pharmaceuticals and personal care products dominated the observed mixture effects. The detected chemicals were not related to the observed genotoxicity. The large proportion of unknown toxicity calls for effect monitoring complementary to chemical monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficacy of three different wastewater treatment configurations, conventional activated sludge (CAS), nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) and biological nutrient removal (BNR) for removal of selected micropollutants from authentic wastewater was investigated. The processes were also characterized based on their proficiency to reduce the estrogenic activity of the influent wastewater using the in vitro recombinant yeast assay. The removal efficiency of trimethoprim improved with the complexity of the three treatment process configurations. Ibuprofen, androstendione, sulfamethoxazole, nonylphenol, estrone and bisphenol-A had moderate to high removals (> 65%) while carbamazepine and meprobamate remained recalcitrant in the three treatment process configurations. The removal of gemfibrozil was better in the NAS than in BNR and CAS treatment configurations. The yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay analyses showed an improvement in estrogenicity removal in the BNR and NAS treatment configurations as compared to the CAS treatment configuration. Comparing the estrogenic responses from the three treatment configurations, the removal efficiencies followed the order of BNR = NAS > CAS and all were greater than 81%.

AB Bioreactors are often an integral part of dairy factory efforts to reduce the biological oxygen demand of their wastewater. In this study, infeed, mixed liquor and supernatant samples of an aerobic bioreactor used by a dairy factory in South-Eastern Australia were analyzed for nutrients and organic compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and physicochemical analyses. Despite different concentrations of organic inputs into the bioreactor, nutrients and trace organic compounds were reduced significantly (i.e. average concentration of trace organic compounds: infeed = 1681 mu g/L: mixed liquor = 257 mu g/L; supernatant = 23 mu g/L). However, during one sampling period the bioreactor was adversely affected by the organic loading. Trace organic compounds in the samples were predominantly fatty acids associated with animal products. The analyses suggest that it is possible to trace a disruptive input (i.e. infeed with high organic carbon concentrations) into an aerobic bioreactor by measuring concentrations of fatty acids or ammonia.

AB To address the inadequate removal of antibiotic resistance genes in wastewater treatment plants, this study investigated the impact of bioaugmentation with dried Eichhornia crassipes roots on removal of antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and erythromycin from pharmaceutical wastewater while optimizing potential for reclaiming value through biogas production, utilizing an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). Three sets of AnMBRs were set up for the experiment, C1 (inoculum), C2 (inoculum + antibiotics) and EC (inoculum + antibiotics + E. crassipes). The results showed that E. crassipes mitigated some of the toxic effects of antibiotics on the microbial community and prevented negative impact on the archaeal community, and significantly increased average biogas production (by 37% compared to control without antibiotics and 42% compared to control with antibiotics) as well as antibiotics removal. Furthermore, bioaugmented reactor showed significant reduction of erythromycin (97%) and tetracycline (83%) concentrations in effluent. Utilization of E. crassipes root offers a simple yet powerful tool for preventing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and dissemination of such pollutants into the environment.

AB A complex treatment of process wastewaters (PWW) of the pharmaceutical industry has been elaborated, the objective was their common disposal and utilization. The biodegradability of polluting components is concentration dependent, the mixing of PWWs with domestic wastewater at WWTP is possible, if no toxic and/or non-biodegradable components are present. So the organic content can serve as carbon source in the denitrification step. The characterization and the proper treatment methods of PWWs have been developed. Only 20-30 % of PWWs required pretreatment. The majority can be mixed directly with the domestic wastewater and send to the WWTP. The characterization includes COD, TOC, BOD, AOX, volatile content, toxicity, metal ion content measurements. The pretreatment methods could be: distillation, WO or catalytic WO. After the activated sludge treatment the degradation of emergent pollutants and the disinfection can be performed by UV-Fenton or high energy irradiation. The design of a complex treatment plant attached to a WWTP of 100000 m(3)/day capacity and its life-cycle analysis to determine the environmental benefits were carried out also.

It enables an engineering - technological prediction of the impact of wastewater biodegradation on DO and TOC profile in a river downstream from the point of entry of wastewater effluent thus providing rapidly and inexpensively significant design information to an environmental scientist or engineer. The method was applied to the determination of degradation of pharmaceutical wastewaters. Biodegradation during adaptation and a comparative study on organic constituents, biodegradation rates in polluted and unpolluted river waters were simulated.

AB The occurrence and removal efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals lidocaine (LDC), tramadol (TRA) and venlafaxine (VEN), and their major active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), O-desmethyltramadol (ODT) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were studied at four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) equipped with activated sludge treatment technologies. In parallel to activated sludge treatment, the removal efficiency of the compounds in pilot- and full-scale projects installed at the WWTPs was investigated. Within these projects two different treatment methods were tested: adsorption onto powdered/granulated activated carbon (PAC/GAC) and ozonation. The metabolite MEGX was not detected in any sample. The concentrations of the target analytes in wastewater effluents resulting from activated sludge treatment ranged from 55 to 183 (LDC), 88 to 416 (TRA), 50 to 245 (ODT), 22 to 176 (VEN) and 77 to 520 ng L-1 (ODV). In the pilot project with subsequent treatment with PAC/GAC, the mean concentrations of the analytes were between <LOQs and 30 (LDC), 111 (TRA), 140 (ODT), 45 (VEN) and 270 ng L-1 (ODV). In the pilot project with subsequent ozonation of the effluent from the conventional treatment the mean concentrations were below the limit of quantification (LOQ) for all of the investigated compounds. The results showed limitations of activated sludge treatment technologies in removing the target compounds but highlighted both PAC/GAC adsorption and ozonation technologies as effective post-treatment processes for the elimination of the target compounds from wastewater in WWTPs. Possible oxidation by-products formed during ozonation were not analyzed.

AB Carbamazepine is an emerging contaminant and resistant to biodegradation, which cannot be effectively removed by the conventional biological wastewater treatment processes. In this study, the combined gamma irradiation and biodegradation was employed to remove carbamazepine from wastewater. The effect of dose on the removal of carbamazepine was studied at different doses (300, 600 and 800 Gy). The results showed that the removal efficiency of carbamazepine increased with dose increasing during the irradiation process. The maximum removal efficiency was 99.8% at 800 Gy, while the removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) was only 26.5%. The removal efficiency of TOC increased to 79.3% after the sequent biological treatment. In addition, several intermediates and organic acids were detected. The possible degradation pathway of carbamazepine during the integrated irradiation and biodegradation was proposed. Based on the overall analysis, the combined gamma irradiation and biological treatment process can be an alternative for removing the recalcitrant organic pollutants such as carbamazepine from wastewater.

AB This work evaluates the removal of five pharmaceuticals and personal care products, i.e., ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, triclosan and propylparaben, from urban wastewater under two novel algal-bacterial photobioreactor settings. The first configuration (phase A) consisted of an anoxic-aerobic photobioreactor operating at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 d at different concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) (90 mg L-1-200 mg L-1). In the second configuration (phase B) an anaerobic step was introduced before the anoxic tank to set a photosynthetic A(2)O process. In this phase, the HRT varied between 3 and 4 d and the TOC was kept constant at 200 mg L-1. In addition, the impact of external aeration in the aerobic photobioreactor was assessed. The maximum removals for ibuprofen, naproxen, salicylic acid, triclosan and propylparaben (94 +/- 1%, 52 +/- 43%, 98 +/- 2%, 100 +/- 0%, 100 +/- 0%, respectively) were recorded during phase B. In phase A, low TOC concentrations triggered higher ibuprofen and naproxen removals likely due to the high contribution of biological oxidation on their removal. In phase B, total or very high removal efficiencies were observed for ibuprofen, propylparaben and triclosan independently on the operating conditions. In contrast, the removal efficiency of naproxen and salicylic acid decreased when the HRT dropped from 4 to 3 d in the absence of external aeration, which suggests that biodegradation played a key role in their removal. In addition, sorption might have contributed to the elimination of triclosan and propylparaben from the wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the extraction of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac from Ladysmith water resources was conducted by means of a multi-template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as selective sorbent in solid-phase extraction. Quantification was done using high performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detection system. Bulk polymerization of MIP was carried out at 70 degrees C for 24 h and characterized with differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and zeta potential. The analytical method detection limits for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac in wastewater treatment plant effluent were 0.23, 1.02 and 0.30 mu g L-1, respectively. Recoveries obtained in wastewater, river water, deionized water and drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) samples spiked with 5 mu g L-1 of target compounds and pre-concentrated using molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) were greater than 80 %. All compounds were not detected in DWTP samples, whereas in river water the concentrations were generally higher in the upstream of wastewater treatment plants compared to downstream. The maximum concentrations detected in river water for naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac were 2.77, 6.72 and 2.58 mu g L-1, respectively. Only diclofenac was present in wastewater at concentrations above the limit of quantification. In conclusion, the high levels of naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac detected in river water could be attributed to poor sanitation in Ladysmith.

AB Two-stage MBR consisting of anaerobic and aerobic reactors was operated at total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 48 h for the treatment of livestock wastewater containing antibiotics, i.e. amoxicillin (AMX), tiamulin (TIA), and chlortetracycline (CTC), under the (1st) absence and (2nd) presence of sludge recirculation between the reactors. During the operation with sludge recirculation, the removals of organic and nitrogen were enhanced. Meanwhile, the removals of TIA and CTC were found to decrease by 9% and 20% in the aerobic reactor but increased by 5% to 7% in the anaerobic reactor due to the relocation of biomass from the aerobic to the anaerobic reactor. A high degree of AMX biodegradation under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions and partial biodegradation of TIA and CTC under aerobic conditions were confirmed in batch experiments. Moreover, the effect of sludge recirculation on biomass and pollutant removal efficiencies in the 2-stage MBR was revealed using microbial community analyses. Membrane filtration also helped to retain the adsorbed antibiotics associated with small colloidal particles in the system.

AB Selection of an appropriate coagulant for removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity from wastewater generated in a pharmaceutical industry was demonstrated. The standard jar test procedure was adopted to determine the optimum pH and coagulant dosage needed for enhanced COD and turbidity removal. Alum and bentonite (montmorillonite) were chosen as coagulant and coagulant aid, respectively. Based on the results obtained from experiments, COD removal (CODRE, %) and turbidity removal (T-RE, %) were optimized using response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, the model predicted a CODRE of 67% and T-RE of 90% and CODRE of 55% and T-RE of 70% using alum (coagulant dosage = 0.79 g/L, pH 5.91) and bentonite (coagulant dosage = 0.58 g/L, pH 5.61), respectively. Confirmatory experiments conducted on the optimized condition showed experimental findings within 5% of the projected values. Though alum resulted in higher CODRE and T-RE as compared to bentonite, bentonite can have the advantage of being environmentally benign when compared to the conventionally used coagulant, alum.

AB Anaerobic treatment of wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry, which contained about 3.2 g/L of sulfate, was carried out in an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. After a startup period of 120 days, a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of more than 90 % was obtained along with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.5 g COD/(L day). During the same period, the sulfate removal was about 90 %. However, the performance of the reactor was affected when the loading rate was increased to 2.09 g COD/(L day). It was found that the accumulation of sulfides, combined with a decrease in the pH, affected the reactor performance. In batch reactor studies with pharmaceutical wastewater it was observed that methane production began only after the initiation of nitrate consumption. The denitrification process can inhibit sulfate reduction at high nitrate concentrations, but compared to reactors without nitrate, the sulfate reduction process and sulfide formation were quickly initiated at low nitrate concentrations. The methanogenic activity was however affected by the presence of more than 2 g/L of sulfate.

AB In this work, seven indigenous macrofungal isolates were selected to screen for their laccase production capability. Among them, isolates viz., Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus florida, Pleurotus sajor caju and Gandoderma lucidum were found to exhibit high laccase activity in the preliminary studies and were thus selected for the optimization studies with an aim to enhance laccase production. The pH optimization studies were carried out between pH range of 4-6. The laccase activity and biomass were found to be optimum at pH 4, 4.5, 4.5 and 5 for P. eryngii, P. florida, P. sajor caju and G. lucidum, respectively. Optimization studies with chemical inducers namely, tannic acid, 2,6 dimethoxyphenol and copper sulphate at three different concentration levels were conducted and tannic acid at 2 mM concentration was found to increase the laccase activity to about 45% followed by 2,6 dimethoxyphenol (2 mM) with an increase of about 43% and copper sulphate (0.1 mM) showing 21% increase in the yield. Biodegradation studies utilizing laccase isolated from P. eryngii, P. florida and P. sajor caju was carried out for a commonly detected fluoroquinolone antibiotic, levofloxacin, in water and pharmaceutical wastewater. The results indicated that the degradation efficiency of levofloxacin using laccase isolated from P. eryngii (88.9%) was comparable to commercial laccase (89%). When the cost economics of using crude laccase was evaluated against commercial laccase it was evident that the total cost of the treatment could be reduced by 71.7% if commercial grade laccase was replaced by crude enzyme extracted from indigenous macrofungi such Pleurotus eryngii, Pleurotus florida, and Pleurotus sajor caju indicating a promising and cost-effective alternative for wastewater treatment.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate acute toxicity of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals exposed to the treatment. The active action of the ultrasonic field (power 750 W, frequency 20 kHz, the amplitude of vibrations 12 mu m) was used as a factor degrading the structure of pharmaceuticals. Tests were carried out using three species of organisms, known indicators in environmental tests. Daphnia magna (DAPHTOXKIT FTM) was used for the tests. Second, in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the toxic effect decrease for another group of organisms, Thamnocephalus platyurus crustacean larvae ( THAMNOTOXKIT FTM) were selected in the next stage. Because these tests require 24 or 48 h to perform, we decided to conduct research using the bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri and MICROTOX apparatus, which provided results in 3 h. The effectiveness of the tested method of degradation of pharmaceuticals was estimated based on the degree of toxic effect reduction of ketoprofen and diclofenac, as well as their mixture and expressed in half-maximal effective concentration. Reduction of toxicity for Daphnia magna was 35%, 22%, and 33% and for Thamnocephalus 28%, 24%, and 30% for ketoprofen, diclofenac and a mixture of both drugs respectively. The reduction of toxicity in the ultrasonic field for Aliivibrio was 60%, 54%, and 37.91% for ketoprofen, diclofenac, and a mixture of pharmaceuticals respectively. On the basis of toxicity tests, it was also found that there is a synergistic effect between selected pharmaceuticals. Our tests have shown that sample sonication may effectively reduce the concentration and ecotoxicity of pharmaceutical pollutants in wastewater.

AB In this study, a lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (AnSBR) was used for the acidification of a pharmaceutical wastewater sourced from etodolac chemical synthesis tanks. The effects of the organic loading rate (OLR), and etodolac and sulfate concentrations on the acidification rate and microbial community in AnSBR were investigated at 35 degrees C with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 37 h, a pH of 5, and OLRs up to 5.2 kgCOD/m(3). day. The AnSBR accomplished a 60% acidification ratio and 50-60% etodolac removal at OLRs up to 2.6 kgCOD/m(3).day. However, at OLR = 3.9 kgCOD/m(3).clay, acidification was not achieved due to sulfite inhibition; pre-ozonation was applied to overcome this sulfite inhibition. Although etodolac and COD removals were improved, the wastewater was not successfully acidified. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that acidification was inhibited by the dominance of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) over acidification bacteria in the AnSBR. However, increasing the OLR to 5.2 kgCOD/m(3).day led to toxicity stress in the SRB due to increased sulfite concentrations. Sulfate load fundamentally affected acidification process and microbial community composition. The presence of etodolac with concentration up to 56 mg/L did not have a significant effect on VFA production and the microbial community. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural resources, including abundant and cheap natural clays in the southern regionare one of the main wealth of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The chemical industry in Kazakhstanis being developedrapidly in recent years and there is an urgent need to find solutions for the treatment of wastewaters. This work aims to explore natural clays for the synthesis of low-cost pillared clays that can be used as catalysts in oxidation technologies for the treatment of wastewaters. Nitrophenols are commonly found in many types of wastewaters (plastic, pharmaceutical, paper or pesticide production).The purification of suchspecific wastewater according to classical schemes does not always ensure a safe level of pollution in waters discharged into water ponds. Thus, further development of the chemical industry will inevitably be associated with the need for more effective disposal of wastewater containing toxic products. 4-nitrophenol was used as a representative model compound in catalyst screening studies.Catalysts based on pillared clays modified with Zr4+ cations were synthesized from natural clays of Karatau and Kokshetau deposits and investigated for the catalytic wastewater peroxide oxidation (CWPO) of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) at 323 degrees K. Pillared clays with Zr4+ showed the higher catalytic activity in the removal of 4-NP and Total organic carbon (TOC)by CWPO and selectivity for the formation of CO2 and H2O than natural clays.The best 4-NP and TOC conversion results were obtained by using the pillared clay from Karatau deposit as a catalyst. A complete removal of the contaminant was achieved after 2 hours with 97.3 % conversion.

AB Gradually increasing concentrations of diclofenac (DCF), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, in water bodies is an emerging concern because of the persistent characteristics and harmful environmental impact of the drug molecule. In this study, electro-oxidation using a novel copper (Cu) - reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode is indicated to be an efficient technology for treating DEC-laden wastewater. The Cu-rGO dispersed carbon film (similar to 1 mm thickness) is synthesized by carbonization and H-2-reduction of a phenolic polymeric film in situ dispersed with a Cu salt and GO. The synthesized self-standing carbon film electrode is used for electro-oxidation of aqueous DCF. Analytical microscopic techniques are used to study the physicochemical properties of the material. Cyclic voltammetry analysis shows the prepared electrode generating a high oxidative current response. Approximately 100% DCF degradation is measured within 1 h at 1 V constant biased potential. Dual roles of Cu-rGO are presented as rGO facilitating direct oxidation via enhanced electron mobility at the electrode surface and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) participating in indirect oxidation by generating OH radicals in aqueous phase. The Cu NPs show an over-potential of -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (100 mM KCI) for oxygen evolution, indicating indirect oxidation of DCF. The high non-faradic current density of 4 mA cm(-2) generated at the positive potential (1 V) indicates direct oxidation of DCF. This study clearly indicates electro-oxidation using the Cu-rGO-dispersed carbon film electrode to be an efficient technique for remediation of pharmaceutical pollutants-contaminated wastewater.

AB While our current generation continues to make efforts to remediate and minimize traditional pollutants in the environment, other "emerging'' environmental contaminants are now warranting attention. These include perfluorinated compounds, nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, antibacterials, hormones, flame retardants, disinfection by-products (DBPs), artificial sweeteners, benzotriazoles, 1,4-dioxane, and algal toxins, as well as emerging contaminants on the horizon: prions and ionic liquids. Wastewater effluents are a major source for many of these emerging contaminants, due to their use in products we use in our households, from pharmaceuticals, detergents, fabric coatings, foam cushions, lotions, sunscreens, cosmetics, hair products, foods and beverages, and food packaging. After use, these chemicals are released in wastewater, and because many are incompletely removed in wastewater treatment, they enter our rivers and drinking water supplies. Surface run-off and agricultural run-off can also be important sources of their entry into the environment. Moreover, many of these contaminants can transform in the environment, from such processes as microbial degradation, photolysis, and hydrolysis, and they can also react with disinfectants in drinking water or wastewater treatment to form disinfection by-products. Issues surrounding these emerging contaminants, include widespread occurrence, bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity. Climate change can also serve to exasperate their effects by concentrating them in rivers during times of drought and by causing resuspension of some (like nanomaterials) during floods. This review will discuss these issues surrounding emerging contaminants and also propose some engineering solutions for the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The capability of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) to remove the iodinated contrast media (ICM) iohexol (IOX) and diatrizoate (DTZ) from municipal wastewater was studied. A selected number of clones of microorganisms present in the biofilm were identified. Biotransformation products were tentatively identified and the toxicity of the treated effluent was assessed. Microbial samples were DNA-sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis in order to confirm the identity of the microorganisms present and determine the microbial diversity. The analysis demonstrated that the wastewater was populated by a bacterial consortium related to different members of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Nitrisporae. The optimum removal values of the ICM achieved were 79 % for IOX and 73 % for DTZ, whereas 13 biotransformation products for IOX and 14 for DTZ were identified. Their determination was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The toxicity of the treated effluent tested to Daphnia magna showed no statistical difference compared to that without the addition of the two ICM. The MBBR was proven to be a technology able to remove a significant percentage of the two ICM from urban wastewater without the formation of toxic biodegradation products. A large number of biotransformation products was found to be formed. Even though the amount of clones sequenced in this study does not reveal the entire bacterial diversity present, it provides an indication of the predominating phylotypes inhabiting the study site.

AB BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP; Tamiflu) is a prodrug of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and has been developed for the treatment and prevention of both A and B strains of influenza. The recent increase in OP resistance in influenza A virus (H1N1; commonlly called "swine flu") has raised questions about the widespread use of Tamiflu in seasonal epidemics and the potential ecotoxicologic risk associated with its use in the event of a pandemic.
   OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to develop an analytical method for quantitative determination of OC in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and receiving river water, and to investigate the occurrence of OC in STP effluent and river water in Japan during a seasonal flu outbreak.
   METHODS: We developed an analytical method based on solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using this method, we analyzed samples from three sampling campaigns conducted during the 2008-2009 flu season in Kyoto City, Japan.
   RESULTS: The highest concentration of OC detected in STP discharge was 293.3 ng/L from a conventional activated-sludge-based STP; however, we detected only 37.9 ng/L from an advanced STP with ozonation as a tertiary treatment. In the receiving river water samples, we detected 6.6-190.2 ng/L OC, during the peak of the flu season.
   CONCLUSION: OC is present in STP effluent and river water only during the flu season. Ozonation as tertiary treatment in STP will substantially reduce the OC load in STP effluent during an influenza epidemic or pandemic.

AB Two physico-chemical processes, coagulation-flocculation and flotation, have been assessed for enhancing the removal of some selected pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) present in sewage, Eight compounds, representative of three main groups of PPCPs according to their physico-chemical properties, have been selected: lipophilic compounds (the synthetic musks Galaxolide and Tonalide), neutral compounds (the tranquillizer Diazepam and the antiepileptic Carbamazepine) and acidic compounds (the anti-inflammatories Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Diclofenae). During the coagulation-flocculation assays, the main parameters considered were the selection of the additives, their doses and the temperature of operation (12 or 25 degrees C), Musks which are highly lipophilic and Diclofenae-with significant sorption affinity-were removed around 50 70%. at both temperatures independently of the dose and type of coagulant used, However, the rest or the compounds, which are more hydrophilic, were affected to a lesser degree (with maximum reductions below 25%). The exceptions to this behavior were Carbamazepine and Ibuprofen, which were not removed under any condition tested. During the flotation assays. the parameters studied were the initial content of fat in wastewaters and temperature. Again, musks were removed to a greater degree (35-60%), followed by Diazepam (40-50%) and Diclofenae (20 45%) and, to a lesser extent, Carbamazepine (20-35%), Ibuprofen (10-25%) and Naproxen (10-30%). The best results were always, obtained at 25 degrees C, although in some cases the operation at 12 degrees C gave similar results, The removal Of musks and neutral compounds was higher in wastewaters with a high fat content (around 150 mgl(-1)).

AB Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant/bactericide that has been applied in various industries (e.g., food processing, pharmaceuticals, medical device sterilization, etc.) as a disinfectant. There is increasing interest in using PM for wastewater disinfection because it does not form halogenated byproducts, and no post-treatment quenching is required. Previous studies have demonstrated good efficiency in controlling bacteria in wastewater, but limited information is available for viruses, especially those hosted by mammals (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a study on the infectivity reduction of murine norovirus (MNV) was undertaken to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of PM or UV alone and in combination with UV irradiation in undisinfected secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility (MWW) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7. Experiments employing MS2 bacteriophage were also performed in parallel for comparison purposes. MS2 infectivity reduction was found to be lower than MNV infectivity reduction for each condition studied - PAA, PAA + UV, and UV disinfection. These data suggest that MS2 may not be an appropriate surrogate to accurately predict the reduction of MNV infectivity.
   UV irradiation, in a dose range of 5-250 mJ/cm(2), provided linear log inactivation (-log (N/N-0)) with a regression slope (cm(2)mJ(-1)) of 0.031-0.034 and 0.165-0.202 for MS2 and MNV, respectively. UV irradiation provided similar inactivation for MS2 and MNV in both suspensions (PBS or MWW). Low infectivity reduction of MS2 was observed when PM was used alone at a practical dose of 1.5 mg/L and below. A greater reduction of both MNV and MS2 was observed in PM disinfection experiments using PBS as the microbial suspension medium, than in secondary effluent. Similar results were observed in PM + UV experiments, in which greater synergistic effects were found in PBS than in MWW. Results of OH center dot radical formation experiments suggest the presence of radical scavengers in MWW, which resulted in less opportunity for MNV and MS2 to encounter OH(center dot)radicals. This study also demonstrated that the type of water can have a substantial impact on wastewater disinfection when employing PM or PM + UV treatment due to the matrix effect and the presence of radical scavengers, respectively. The results from this study could be employed to aid in the conceptual design of PM and UV disinfection facilities, especially when norovirus is the organism of concern.

AB In this work, the impact of microwave (MW) irradiation time and precursors molar ratios on the yield, size, shape, and photodegradation activity of ZnO nanorods (ZNs) has been studied. The as-prepared ZNs photo catalyst (PC) are employed for the degradation of dyes mixture and antibiotic pharmaceuticals under simulated sunlight (SL). The results have shown MW irradiation time has the foremost influence on improving crystallinity, light absorption, and decreasing band gap, as well as enhancing degradation efficiency. It is found that the precursor's molar ratio has minor effects on the crystallinity and bandgap. ZN5 PC has the highest crystallinity and light absorption with the lowest bandgap, and the highest performance in methylene blue (MB) mineralization as well. It is recorded that after 45 min the increase in the initial MB concentration reduces the photo degradation efficiency from 98 % to 35 %. Complete mineralization of dyes and pharmaceuticals is achieved with 100 % COD removal using ZN5 within 150 min. Conclusively, the ZN5/solar simulator system is not a selective technology for the decontamination of dyes and pharmaceutical wastewater. In addition, the matrix effect using humic acid (HA) has been investigated, the degradation rate constant of dye decreased from 4 x 10-2 min(-1) to 2.3 x 10(-2) min(-1), 1.1 x 10(-2) min(-1), and 1 x 10 min(-1) for 1, 5, and 10 mg.L-1 HA, respectively. The influence of salinity on the photodegradation efficiency is also studied. The application of ZN5 in wastewater degradation is found to have great stability and reusability with a reduction of the treatment cost and the environmental impact by 90 %.

AB The integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVCW) is considered as a potential alternative for domestic wastewater treatment of towns and small cities. Oxygen supply is the main limitation of pollutants removal in IVCWs. In the present study, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the capacity and kinetics of pollutants removal in IVCWs with/without artificial aeration. Two IVCWs constructed with Canna indica and Phragmites australis were running in continuous flow to remove high concentrations of conventional pollutants and low concentrations of tetracyclines (TETs), which are at similar levels of domestic wastewater. The results showed that IVCWs had a good performance on COD, phosphorus, and TETs with removal efficiencies over 80%, 64%, and 75%, respectively, with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.0 d. However, the removal of nitrogen was limited, showing as TN removal efficiency of about 30%. The IVCW with Phragmites australis had a higher removal efficiency and rate. A kinetics based on Monod Equation and solved with Matlab 2018a could describe the degradation of conventional pollutants. Artificial aeration improved the oxygen supply and remarkably raised the removal capacity for COD, N, and P in IVCWs. The q1/2 values, which was defined as the average removal loading before half of the pollutants was removed and represented the removal capacity without limitation of pollutants concentration, were increased by 5-30 times after aeration. In conclusion, IVCWs could remove conventional pollutants and TETs simultaneously showing a great potential in domestic wastewater treatment. Artificial aeration enhanced removal capacity of IVCWs on conventional pollutants while showed little influence on TETs.

AB Background: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are microbial factories aimed to reduce the amount of nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms in the treated wastewater before its discharge into the environment. We studied the impact of urban WWTP effluents on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli (AR-E. coli) in the last stretch of two rivers (Arrone and Tiber) in Central Italy that differ in size and flow volume. Methods: Water samples were collected in three seasons upstream and downstream of the WWTP, at the WWTP outlet, and at sea sites near the river mouth, and analyzed for the abundance of ARGs by qPCR and AR-E. coli using cultivation followed by disk diffusion assays. Results: For all studied genes (16S rRNA, intI1, sul1, ermB, blaTEM, tetW and qnrS), absolute concentrations were significantly higher in the Tiber than in the Arrone at all sampling sites, despite their collection date, but the prevalence of target ARGs within bacterial communities in both rivers was similar. The absolute concentrations of most ARGs were also generally higher in the WWTP effluent with median levels between log 4 and log 6 copies per ml but did not show differences along the studied stretches of rivers. Statistically significant site effect was found for E. coli phenotypic resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin in the Arrone but not in the Tiber. Conclusions: In both rivers, diffuse or point pollution sources other than the studied WWTP effluents may account for the observed resistance pattern, although the Arrone appears as more sensitive to the wastewater impact considering its lower flow volume.

AB Fish can be exposed to a variety of neuroactive pharmaceuticals via the effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants and concerns have arisen regarding their potential impacts on fish behaviour and ecology. In this study, we investigated the uptake of 14 neuroactive pharmaceuticals from a treated wastewater effluent into blood plasma and brain regions of roach (Rutilus rutilus) after exposure for 15 days. We show that a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals including, 6 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, 3 atypical antipsychotics, 2 tricyclic antidepressants and a benzodiazepine, concentrate in different regions of the brain including the telencephalon, hypothalamus, optic tectum and hindbrain of effluent-exposed fish. Pharmaceuticals, with the exception of nordiazepam, were between 3-40 fold higher in brain compared with blood plasma, showing these neuroactive drugs are readily uptaken, into brain tissues in fish. To assess for the potential for any adverse ecotoxicological effects, the effect ratio was calculated from human therapeutic plasma concentrations (HtPCs) and the measured or predicted fish plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals. After accounting for a safety factor of 1000, the effect ratios indicated that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, and amitriptyline warrant prioritisation for risk assessment studies. Furthermore, although plasma concentrations of all the pharmaceuticals were between 33 and 5714-fold below HtPCs, alterations in serotonin, glutamate, acetylcholine and tryptophan concentrations were observed in different brain regions of effluent-exposed fish. This study highlights the importance of determining the potential health effects arising from the concentration of complex environmental mixtures in risk assessment studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) discharged with wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are an emerging surface water quality concern. Biological transformation has been identified as an important removal mechanism during wastewater treatment. The aim of this research was the identification of bacteria with characteristics for potential bioaugmentation to enhance PPCP removal. We report here the cultivation and characterization of bacteria capable of degrading PPCPs to ng/L concentrations. An isolation approach was developed using serial enrichment in mineral medium containing 1 mg/L of an individual PPCP as the sole organic carbon source available to heterotrophs until the original activated sludge inocula was diluted to similar to 10(-8) of its initial concentration, followed by colony growth on solid R2A agar. Eleven bacteria were isolated, eight that could remove triclosan, bisphenol A, ibuprofen, or 17 beta-estradiol to below 10 ng/L, one that could remove gemfibrozil to below 60 ng/L, and two that could remove triclosan or E2, but not to ng/L concentrations. Most bacterial isolates degraded contaminants during early growth when grown utilizing rich carbon sources and were only able to degrade the PPCPs on which they were isolated. Seven of the bacterial isolates were sphingomonads, including all the triclosan and bisphenol A degraders and the ibuprofen degrader. The study results indicate that the isolated bacteria may have a positive influence on removal in WWTPs if present at sufficient concentrations and may be useful for bioaugmentation.

AB The electrochemical performance of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode in the electrochemical degradation of wastewaters containing sulfadiazine (SDZ) using a filter-press reactor is presented and discussed. The electrooxidation of the SDZ (volume of 0.5 L, with a SDZ initial concentration of 250 mg L-1) obtained at optimized conditions (current density of 36 mA cm(-2), pH 7.0 and volume flow rate of 5.0 L min(-1)) showed that at the end of only 2 h of electrolysis (corresponding to a charge passed through the cell per unit volume of the wastewater of 5.2 Ah L-1) SDZ was totally eliminated. The reduction of the wastewater organic load, monitored by its chemical oxygen demand (COD) showed that the antibiotic was virtually all mineralized. Under optimized conditions the intermediate compounds were properly identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and a SDZ oxidation pathway was elucidated. Clearly the BDD electrode proved to be quite efficient for both degradation and mineralization of SDZ.

AB Hormesis is an ecotoxicological phenomenon referred to as the biphasic dose-response effect. At a low concentration of toxic substances, a hormetic stimulating effect occurs, while an inhibitory effect occurs at higher concentrations. The phenomenon of hormesis may hinder the interpretation of toxicity test results and lower the actual toxicity of test samples. In this study, a hormesis phenomenon was observed and analysed during toxicity tests of wastewater from constructed wetlands containing two pharmaceutical substances, diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), against the marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri. To eliminate the hormesis phenomenon, a change in the diluent (ISO 11348-3:2007) to synthetic sea water (ISO 10253:2006) is proposed. The hormesis phenomenon was observed only during the analysis of wastewater toxicity with the standard toxicity test (with the diluent). The use of synthetic sea water eliminated the hormetic effects because of the presence of additional components in the sea water, such as MgCl2, Na2SO4, CaCl2, KCl, NaHCO3, and H3BO3, which increased the sensitivity of A. fischeri to the pharmaceutical substances. The use of different media in toxicity tests may have significant effects on the toxicity classification of the tested compounds or wastewater. Additionally, the toxicity of tested pharmaceuticals towards A. fischeri was analysed. The IC50 values of DCF were 8.7 +/- 1.1 mg L-1 (for diluent) and 13.9 +/- 0.9 mg L-1 (for synthetic sea water) whereas those of SMX were 50.5 +/- 2.3 and 55.3 +/- 1.6 mg L-1, respectively.

AB Despite the fact that there are tens of thousands of thermal baths in existence, knowledge about the occurrence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in untreated thermal wastewater is very limited. Because used thermal water is typically legally discharged into surface waters without any treatment, the effluent poses environmental risks for the receiving water bodies. The aim of this study was to show the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal characteristics of 111 PhACs in thermal wastewater. Six thermal water outflows of different thermal baths were tested in different seasons in the Budapest metropolitan region (Hungary), and diurnal analysis was performed. After solid-phase extraction, the samples were analysed and quantified by coupling supercritical fluid chromatography and mass spectrometry to perform simultaneous multi-residue drug analysis. The results confirm that water discharge pipes directly transport pharmaceuticals into surface water bodies; 34 PhACs were measured to be over the limit of quantification at least once, and 21 of them were found in more than one water sample. The local anaesthetic drug lidocaine, antiepileptic carbamazepine, analgesic derivative tramadol and illicit drug cocaine were detected in more than half of the samples. Caffeine, metoprolol and bisoprolol (cardiovascular drugs), benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite), diclofenac (NSAID), citalopram (antidepressant) and certain types of hormones also have a significant frequency of 30-50%. However, the occurrence and concentrations of PhACs vary according to the season and number/types of visitors. As demonstrated by the diurnal fluctuation, drug contamination of thermal waters can significantly vary, even for similar types of baths; furthermore, the quantity and types of some pollutants rapidly change in the discharged thermal wastewater.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater have become an emerging issue due to their negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems. Two full-scale municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along the Songhua River were chosen to evaluate the intra-day dynamics, seasonal variations and removal of 12 selected PPCPs. Our results suggested that the selected PPCPs were frequently detected in the influent and effluent. Caffeine was the predominant compound in the influent; while the selected PPCPs was dominated by TCS in the effluent, suggesting the different fates of selected PPCPs in the WWTPs. The intra-day dynamics of PPCPs in the influent were evaluated, suggesting that the 12 PPCPs can be grouped into three categories because of their different use patterns. The analysis of seasonal changes of PPCPs concentrations in the WWTPs suggested that the concentrations of some PPCPs were influenced by the chemical usage, degradation and temperature. The removal efficiency for the PPCPs were very high with the values ranged from 70.0% to 99.7% for WWTP#1, and from 62.5% to 99.4% for WWTP#2. Significant seasonal variations of PPCPs removal efficiency were observed. Base on the mass loading of PPCPs in the two WWTPs, our results suggested that WWTP#1 in the urban core received much more PPCPs in comparison to WWTP#2 in the suburban regions, suggesting that influences of the service population.

AB A 5-week mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) to periphytic algae in an environmentally-realistic scenario. We used outdoor experimental streams to simulate the characteristics of central Texas streams receiving large discharges of wastewater treatment plant effluent during prolonged periods of drought. The streams were continually dosed and maintained at two concentrations. The first represents an environmentally relevant concentration of 0.05 mg L-1 (low concentration). The second treatment of 5 mg L-1 (high concentration) was selected to represent a scenario where TiO(2)NPs are used for photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Algal cell density, chlorophyll- a, ash-free dry mass, algal assemblage composition, and Ti accumulation were determined for the periphyton in the riffle sections of each stream. The high concentration treatment of TiO(2)NPs significantly decreased algal cell density, ash-free dry mass, and chlorophyll-a, and altered algal assemblage composition. Decreased abundance of three typically pollution-sensitive taxa and increased abundance of two genera associated with heavy metal sorption and organic pollution significantly contributed to algal assemblage composition changes in response to TiO(2)NPs. Benefits of the use of TiO(2)NPs in wastewater treatment plants will need to be carefully weighed against the demonstrated ability of these NPs to cause large changes in periphyton that would likely propagate significant effects throughout the stream ecosystem, even in the absence of direct toxicity to higher trophic level organisms.

AB Reuse of treated wastewater to irrigate agricultural crops is increasing in many arid and semi-arid areas around the world. The presence of numerous pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in treated wastewater and their potential transfer into food produce such as vegetables poses an unknown human health risk. The goal of this study was to identify PPCPs that have a comparatively high potential for plant uptake and translocation. A total of 20 frequently-occurring PPCPs were compared for their accumulation into four staple vegetables (lettuce, spinach, cucumber, and pepper) grown in nutrient solutions containing PPCPs at 0.5 or 5 mu g L-1. Triclocarban, fluoxetine, triclosan, and diazepam were found at high levels in roots, while meprobamate, primidone, carbamazepine, dilantin, and diuron exhibited more active translocation from roots to leaves. Root uptake of neutral PPCPs was positively correlated with the pH adjusted log K-ow(i.e., log D-ow), and was likely driven by chemical adsorption onto the root surfaces. In contrast, translocation from roots to leaves was negatively related to log D., suggesting hydrophilicity-regulated transport via xylems. Compounds preferentially sorbed to roots should be further evaluated for their uptake in tuber vegetables (e.g., carrot, radish) under field conditions, while those easily translocated into leaves (e.g., carbamazepine, dilantin) merit focused consideration for leafy and other vegetables (e.g., lettuce, cucumber). However, estimation of dietary intake by humans suggested the implied risks from exposure to PPCPs via wastewater irrigation to be negligible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent recognition of the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment has highlighted concerns regarding potential threats of antibiotics to humans and wildlife. Antibiotics are commonly applied to animals to prevent diseases and promote growth, making livestock agriculture a major source of antibiotic pollution. The purpose of our study was to examine chlorination technology as a method for preventing the release of antibiotics as well as antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment from concentrated animal feeding operations. Wastewaters from various sites of two anaerobic lagoon systems, one aerated and the other not, on a swine facility were investigated. Each system consisted of a primary treatment lagoon and a subsequent polishing lagoon. Free chlorine ( or monochloramine for comparison) was applied to oxidize antibiotics and to disinfect lagoon bacteria as well. Results indicate that aeration substantially improves lagoon functionality, thereby adding both organic and ammonia removal. Ammonia present in the wastewaters plays a critical role in antibiotics decomposition and bacterial inactivation due to its rapid competition for free chlorine to form monochloramine. Generally, a chlorine dose close to breakpoint is required to achieve complete removal of antibiotics, leading to high consumption of free chlorine in most of the wastewaters examined. However, because of a low ammonia concentration in the polishing lagoon wastewater of the aerated system, a chlorine dose of 100 mg/L can effectively achieve complete removal of both antibiotics and bacteria. On the basis of our experimental findings, a possible strategy for the treatment of swine wastewater is suggested.

AB We investigated the efficiencies of removal of 24 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) during sand filtration and ozonation in an operating municipal sewage treatment plant (STP). The target compounds were 2 phenolic antiseptics (thymol, triclosan), 5 acidic analgesics or anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid), 4 amide pharmaceuticals (propyphenazone, crotamiton, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide), 7 antibiotics (sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, azithromycin, erythromycin anhydride, clarithromycin, roxithromycin), 3 phenolic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (nonylphenol:NP, octylphenol:OP, bisphenol A:BPA) and 3 natural estrogens (17 beta-estradiol:E2, estrone:E1, estriol:E3). Ozonation removed similar to 80% or more of the phenolic antiseptics, crotamiton, sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics, and 17 beta-estradiol. Their removal is discussed in terms of chemical structure. The study ascertained the validity of ozonation mechanisms proposed by previous studies in an actually running STP. Compounds with a C = C double bond or an aromatic structure with electron donors (e.g., phenol, alkyl, methoxy, or non-protonated amine) were susceptible to ozonation. Compounds with amide structures were resistant. Removal of the PhACs during sand filtration was generally inefficient, probably because of their low hydrophobicities. The combination of ozonation and sand filtration with activated sludge treatment gave efficient removal (>80%) of all the target compounds except carbamazepine and diethyltoluamide. Among all the steps in the plant, ozonation contributed substantially to overall removal of naproxen, ketoprofen, triclosan, crotamiton, sulfapyridine, macrolide antibiotics, and estrone.

AB Bank filtration and artificial ground water recharge are important, effective, and cheap techniques for surface water treatment and removal of microbes, as well as inorganic, and some organic, contaminants. Nevertheless, physical, chemical, and biological processes of the removal of impurities are not understood sufficiently. A research project titled Natural and Artificial Systems for Recharge and Infiltration attempts to provide more clarity in the processes affecting the removal of these contaminants. The project focuses on the fate and transport of selected emerging contaminants during bank filtration at two transects in Berlin, Germany. Several detections of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in ground water samples from bank filtration sites in Germany led to furthering research on the removal of these compounds during bank filtration. In this study, six PhACs including the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone, the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone, and the drug metabolites clofibric acid and 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide were found to leach from the contaminated streams and lakes into the ground water. These compounds were also detected at low concentrations in receiving public supply wells. Bank filtration either decreased the concentrations by dilution (e.g., for carbamazepine and primidone) and partial removal (e.g., for diclofenac), or totally removed PhACs (e.g., bezafibrate, indomethacine, antibiotics, and estrogens). Several PhACs, such as carbamazepine and especially primidone, were readily transported during bank filtration. They are thought to be good indicators for evaluating whether surface water is impacted by contamination from municipal sewage effluent or whether contamination associated with sewage effluent can be transported into ground water at ground water recharge sites.

AB A practical test kit based on diazotization reaction of aromatic amines followed by coupling with 2-methyl-8-hydroxyquinoline has been developed to determine trace aniline in wastewater and surface water samples. The test kit consists of four tablets, which are added to the sample in sequence. The maximum absorption wavelength of the orange dye formed is 482 nm. Molar absorptivity and detection limit were found to be 2.5 x 10(4) mol(-1) cm(-1) and 0.020 mg L-1, respectively. Linearity was excellent in the concentration range 0.10-3.5 mg L-1 aniline in water. The test kit has been used to analyze aniline in polluted river water and wastewater samples from a pharmaceutical factory. The recoveries of addition of aniline in real water samples were between 95-106% (n=5) and relative standard deviation was less than 5% for standard sample at a concentration of 2.0 mg L-1 aniline, It's a very sensitive and easy-to-operate method for in situ analysis of aniline in water.

AB The potential presence of introduced antibiotics in the aquatic environment is a hot topic of concern, particularly in the Antarctic, a highly vulnerable area protected under the Madrid protocol. The increasing presence of human population, especially during summer, might led to the appearance of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. The previous discovery of Escherichia coli strains resistant to antibiotics in sea water and wastewater collected in King George Island motivated our investigation on antibiotics occurrence in these samples. The application of a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method for 20 antibiotics, revealed the presence of 8 compounds in treated wastewater, mainly the quinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin (92% and 54% of the samples analyzed, average concentrations 0.89 mu g/L and 0.75 mu g/L, respectively) and the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin (15% positive samples, and average concentrations near 0.4 mu g/L), and erythromycin (38% positive samples, average concentration 0.003 mu g/L). Metronidazole and clindamycin were found in one sample, at 0.17 and 0.1 mu g/L, respectively; and trimethoprim in two samples, at 0.001 mu g/L. Analysis of sea water collected near the outfall of the wastewater discharges also showed the sporadic presence of 3 antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim) at low ng/L level, illustrating the impact of pharmaceuticals consumption and the poor removal of these compounds in conventional WWTPs. The most widespread antibiotic in sea water was ciprofloxacin, which was found in 15 out of 34 sea water samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 218 ng/L. Bacteria resistance was observed for some antibiotics identified in the samples (e.g. trimetropim and nalidixic acid -a first generation quinolone). However, resistance to some groups of antibiotics could not be correlated to their presence in the water samples due to analytical limitations (penicillins, tetraciclines). On the contrary, for some groups of antibiotics detected in samples (macrolides), the antibacterial activity against E. Coli was not investigated because these antibiotics do not include this bacterial species in their spectrum of activity.
   Our preliminary data demonstrate that antibiotics occurrence in the Antarctic aquatic environment is an issue that needs to be properly addressed. Periodical monitoring of water samples and the implementation of additional treatments in the WWTPs are recommended as a first step to prevent potential problems related to the presence of antibiotics and other emerging contaminants in the near future in Antarctica.

AB An efficient and environmentally-friendly photocatalytic degradation process by nontoxic and easily-recovered photocatalysts is desirable for wastewater treatment. Step-scheme (S-scheme) SnFe2O4/ZnFe(2)O(4 )nano-heterojunctions with nontoxicity, strong magnetism, and high visible-light photocatalytic performance were synthesized by one-step solvothermal strategy, and SnFe2O4 content was optimized. 5% SnFe2O4/ZnFe(2)O(4 )heterojunctions exhibited optimal visible-light photocatalytic performance in degrading tetracycline with 93.2% removal efficiency, and the COD of actual pharmaceutical wastewater decreased by 77.5% due to the efficient production of active species. Moreover, 5% SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 heterojunctions is very convenient to be recycled from solution using external magnetic field, and the photocatalytic activity remains almost unchanged in repeated use due to its strong magnetism and high stability. More significantly, the toxicity evaluation confirmed nontoxicity of SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 and rapid toxicity elimination process of tetracycline by photocatalysis, indicating that environment-friendly and magnetically recoverable S-scheme SnFe2O4/ZnFe2O4 heterojunction is a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.

AB The estimation of medication use is based on the statistical data from pharmacies and hospitals. Excessive use or misuse of some compounds, especially psychoactive medications, has not yet been monitored in Slovakia. Wastewater analysis provides useful data about the medication use and misuse in individual regions. This study is focused on the analysis of 23 substances in the wastewaters of Slovakia. The monitoring programme has included stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, drug precursors and their metabolites. Urinary markers of these compounds were analysed atWWTP influent in seven regions (Bratislava, Kosice, Zvolen, Banska Bystrica, Trencin, Presov a Piest'any) using LC-MS/MS technique. The analysis was performed from March to October 2013. The pattern in use of these compounds was also monitored. Tramadol and venlafaxine were found to be the most concentrated compounds among of all studied psychoactive pharmaceuticals. The highest specific loads of tramadol were detected in Piestany (409 mg/day/1000 inhabitants) and Zvolen (366 mg/day/1000 inhabitants). There is a considerable number of spa facilities (hotels) situated in these cities and this fact contributes to a higher occurrence of these psychoactive compounds in respective wastewaters.

AB Sludge based activated carbons (ACs) were used to remove selected pharmaceuticals such as diclofenac (DCF) and nimesulide (NM) from aqueous solutions. The powered sewage sludge was mixed with different proportions of ZnCl2. The mixture was pyrolyzed in a conventional oven using three different temperatures under inert atmosphere. Afterwards, in order to increase the specific surface area and uptake capacity the carbonized materials were acidified with 6mol L-1 HCl under reflux at 80 A degrees C for 3 hours. The characterization of ACs was achieved by scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, TGA, hydrophobicity index by water, n-heptane vapor adsorption and nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves. The specific surface area (S (BET) ) of adsorbents varied between 21.2 and 679.3m(2)g(-1). According to the water and n-heptane analysis data all ACs had hydrophobic surface. Experimental variables such as pH, mass of adsorbent and temperature on the adsorption capacities were studied. The optimum pH, mass of adsorbent and temperature for adsorption of DCF and NM onto ACs were found to be 7.0 (DCF) and 10.0 (NM), 30mg and 25 A degrees C, respectively. The kinetic adsorption was investigated using general-order, pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models, while the general-order model described the adsorption process most suitably. The maximum amounts of DCF and NM adsorbed were 156.7 and 66.4mg g(-1) for sample 1(500-15-0.5), respectively.

AB Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a recalcitrant pharmaceutical often detected in wastewater and in the environment. CBZ can be removed from wastewater through advanced oxidation treatment methods such as ozonation. In this study, CBZ and its transformation product 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD) were ozonated, and the formation and transformation of their ozonation products were investigated using liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The main products, 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-4-hydro-(1H,3H)-quinazoline-2-one (BQM) and BQD were quantified using isolated standards and LC-UV. Of the original CBZ concentration, 74% was transformed into BQM and 83% of BQM was further transformed into BQD. Both products are more stable than CBZ and could still be detected after 240 min of ozonation. Another major product, 2,2 '-azanediyldibenzaldehyde (TP225) was for the first time identified using NMR. Twelve further CBZ products were identified.

AB Coastal onsite wastewater disposal systems (OWDS) were inundated by Hurricane Sandy's storm tide. This study compares the shallow groundwater quality (nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones) downgradient of OWDS before and after Hurricane Sandy, where available, and establishes a baseline for wastewater influence on groundwater in coastal communities inundated by Hurricane Sandy. Nutrients and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were detected in shallow, groundwater downgradient of OWDS in two settings along the New Jersey and New York coastlines: 1) a single, centralized OWDS in a park; and 2) multiple OWDS (cesspools) in low-density residential and mixed-use/medium density residential areas. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were lidocaine (40%), carbamazepine (36%), and fexofenadine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, meprobamate, and tramadol (24-32%). Increases in the number and total concentration of pharmaceuticals after Hurricane Sandy may reflect other factors (seasonality, usage) besides inundation, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing for a wide variety of CECs in regional studies.

AB Drug concentrations in composite municipal wastewater samples and census-based estimates of population are used to derive daily loads of illicit substances that are indexed to population. However, such estimates do not provide information on the diurnal trends of substance excretion nor can they account for changes in population. To address these limitations, a series of 1 h composites created by sampling wastewater influent at 6 mm intervals was collected over four consecutive days at a single wastewater treatment plant. Creatinine (a urinary indicator), caffeine, methamphetamine, benzoylecgonine (BZE), and cocaine were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Diurnal trends and between-day trends were substance specific and related to the number of estimated doses and excretory half-life. Normalization to creatinine yielded trends in substances that differed significantly from non-normalized trends by accounting for changes in population within the municipality studied. Increases in normalized substance excretion observed during early morning hours originate from individuals among the resident population of the municipality due to the absence of commuters.

AB In this study, a magnetic waste-tyre derived activated carbon modified with methyltri-octylammonium chloride, was successfully synthesized, characterised, and applied for the extraction and preconcentration of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in wastewater. The scanning electron microscopy and N-2-adsorption/desorption analysis results confirmed that the synthesized nanocomposite was porous with a large specific surface area of 570 m(2) g(-1). The significant factors affecting the Ultrasonic assisted magnetic solid phase extraction method were investigated using univariate approach and response surface methodology. The optimum conditions for the extraction and preconcentration of the target analytes were 0%, 15 min, 6.5 and 30 mg, for ionic strength, extraction time, pH and adsorbent mass respectively. The quantification of the target analytes was performed using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with diode array detector. Under optimum conditions, low limits of detection and quantification ranging between 0.054-0.38 mu g L-1 and 0.18-1.27 mu g L-1, respectively, were obtained. A wide linearity (ranging from limit of detection - 500 mu g L-1 with R-2 >= 0.99) and precision lower than 7%, were achieved. The applicability of proposed method was evaluated for the determination of naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac in wastewater. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Analysis of municipal wastewater for drug metabolites can reveal the scale of drug use within communities. An Australian city with a population of 1.2 million inhabitants was assessed for 4 stimulants: cocaine, methamphetamine, 3.4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and amphetamine; 6 opioids: codeine, morphine, heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone and methadone; 11 new psychoactive substances (NPS); benzylpiperazine (BZP), trifluoro-methylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), methcathinone, methylone, mephedrone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), alpha pyrrolidinopentiophenone (alpha-PVP), paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), 25C-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe; and cannabis, for up to four years between December 2011 and December 2015. Temporal trends revealed increasing usage rates of methamphetamine, cocaine, oxycodone, and fentanyl, while decreasing rates of use were observed for MDMA, BZP and methylone. Use of other opioids and cannabis was generally stable across years, while use of new psychoactive substances fluctuated without an apparent direction. Opioids and cannabis were used at a consistent level through the course of the week, while use of stimulants and some NPS increased on the weekend. Seasonal differences in use were observed for MDMA and cannabis (p $_amp_$lt; 0.05) where, on average, MDMA use was approximately 90% higher in December than in other months and cannabis use was approximately 45% lower in each February. Residual month-to-month variability measures on trend-free data showed NPS use had higher variability than the stimulants and opioids. Frequent wastewater sampling and analysis over prolonged periods has yielded valuable insights into long-term drug use trends, in some instances revealed important within-year trends, and demonstrated the differing patterns of use of drugs on weekends compared to weekdays.

AB Eight typical pharmaceuticals in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Xi'an city in China were investigated to determine their occurrence and removal efficiencies. Target pharmaceuticals were extracted from wastewater and sludge samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) after derivatization. The results indicated that the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.39 to 642 mu g L (1) in the influents, which were similar with or one order magnitude higher than that of previous reports, and phenacetin, gemfibrozil and caffeine were main contributors. The concentrations in the effluents were between 0.075 and 7.01 mg L (1), and 80-100% pharmaceuticals were removed in the WWTPs except diclofenac, which was removed nearly 72-85%. Three main removal pathways including physicochemical process, biodegradation and sludge adsorption were involved in the removal of the pharmaceuticals. Almost 20-50% of the pharmaceuticals were removed through physicochemical operating units, and high concentration pharmaceuticals were examined in the floating oil from aerated grit chamber. Nearly 11-89% and 0-15% pharmaceuticals were removed by biodegradation and sludge adsorption, respectively. Aerobic condition was advantageous for the biodegradation of phenacetin, gemfibrozil and caffeine, while cholesterol was easily decomposed by anaerobic microorganism. It showed that high temperature was beneficial to the biological removal of gemfibrozil, and acidic condition could be more helpful to the biodegradation of diclofenac and its removal efficiency reached 60% at pH 4.5. However, biodegradability of diclofenac should be further investigated to eliminate its adverse effects on human health and ecological environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) to cause adverse impacts to groundwater quality is a major global environmental challenge. Robust and sensitive techniques are required to characterise these impacts, particularly in settings with multiple potential contaminant sources (e.g. agricultural vs. site-derived). Stable (delta H-2(H2O), delta O-18(H2O), delta N-15(NO3), delta O-18(NO3) and delta C-13(DIC)) and radioactive (H-3 and C-14) isotopes were used in conjunction with three Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) - carbamazepine, simazine and sulfamethoxazole - to discriminate between multiple potential contamination sources at an Australian WWTP. The radioactive isotope tritium provided a sensitive indicator of recent (post-1990s) leakage, with groundwater activities between 0.68 and 1.83 TU, suggesting WWTP infrastructure (activities between 1.65 and 2.41) acted as a recharge 'window', inputting treated or partially treated effluent to the underlying groundwater system. This was corroborated by water stable isotopes, which showed clear demarcation between delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O) in background groundwater (delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O) values of approximately -5 and -28 parts per thousand, respectively) and those associated with on-site wastewater (median delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O) values of -1.2 and -7.6 parts per thousand, respectively), with groundwater down-gradient of the plant plotting on a mixing line between these values. The CECs, particularly the carbamazepine:simazine ratio, provided a means to further distinguish wastewater impacts from other sources, with groundwater down-gradient of the plant reporting elevated ratios (median of 0.98) compared to those up-gradient (median of 0.11). Distinctive CEC ratios in impacted groundwater close to the WWTP (similar to 3.0) and further down-gradient (2.7-9.3) are interpreted to represent a change in composition over time (i.e., recent vs. legacy contamination), consistent with the site development timeline and possible changes in effluent composition resulting from infrastructure upgrades over time. The data indicate a complex set of co-mingled plumes, reflecting different inputs (in terms of both quantity and concentration) over time. Our approach provides a means to better characterise the nature and timing of wastewater derived impacts on groundwater systems, with significant global implications for site management, potentially allowing more targeted monitoring, management and remedial actions to be undertaken.

AB Naproxen is one of the mostly used drugs worldwide and is most abundant in wastewater. This study aims to adsorb naproxen from wastewater using magnetically modified carbon-based adsorbents. These adsorbents have very large specific area for naproxen adsorption, and magnetite modification provides easy separation and regeneration. The co-precipitation method was used for magnetic modification. Adsorption process was carried out in batches. The effect of adsorption variables was investigated. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms were applied to the equilibrium data. The maximum adsorption capacities of adsorbents from Langmuir isotherm were found as 20.75 mg/g for magnetic multi-wall carbon nanotubes and 87.79 mg/g for magnetic activated carbon. Pseudo-first-order kinetic model, pseudo-second-order kinetic model, intra-particle diffusion model, and Bangham model were used for determination of adsorption mechanisms. The rate-limiting step is electron exchange between the adsorbent and adsorbate. Both film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion occur while the adsorption process. Delta GA degrees, Delta SA degrees, and Delta HA degrees were calculated for the process.

AB The extraction and stripping of silver ions by hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) was examined. Pharmaceutical wastewater containing 30 mg/dm(3) of silver ions was used as the feed solution. LIX 84-I dissolved in kerosene, and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate solution were used as the liquid membrane and stripping solution, respectively. The influences of several variables on the extraction and stripping of silver ions were investigated. Fluid-flow models for greater accuracy in describing the transport of silver ions from feed phase to stripping phase were developed. The models were calculated by linear algebra. The investigated parameters in the models were axial convections and axial diffusions on both sides, chemical reactions at the feed-liquid membrane and liquid membrane-stripping interfaces as well as the accumulation of silver ions in the system. The mass transfer coefficient in the liquid membrane (k(m)) was determined for use in the models. The final predicted concentrations of silver ions in feed and stripping phases were successfully in agreement with the experimental data. It indicates that the fluid-flow model can accurately estimate the transport of silver ions inside and outside the hollow fibers corresponding to the axial convections, axial diffusions, reactions at the feed-liquid membrane and liquid membrane-stripping interfaces. In accordance with this investigation, the HFSLM shows a practical implication for the use in pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study used wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to investigate the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Male, the capital of the Republic of Maldives. Raw wastewater 12-h composite samples were collected from nine pumping stations serving the city area - thus representative of the whole Male population. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for estimating the profile of use of a large number of substances including illicit drugs, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco and pharmaceuticals. The illicit drugs most used were cannabis (THC) and heroin (700 and 18 g/day), with lower consumption of cocaine and amphetamines (0.1-1.2 g/day). It is important to note that the consumption of cannabis in Male was comparable to that measured in other countries, while the consumption of heroin was higher. Among cathinones, mephedrone was detected at the highest levels similar to other countries. Consumption of alcohol, which is not allowed in Maldives, was found (1.3 L/day/1000 inhabitants), but at a low level compared with other countries (6-44 L/day/1000 inhabitants), while the consumption of caffeine and tobacco was generally in line with reports from other countries. Unique information on pharmaceuticals use was also provided, since no official data were available. Human lifestyle was evaluated by applying for the first time the full set of WBE methodologies available in our laboratory. Results provided valuable epidemiological information, which may be useful for national and international agencies to understand - Corresponding population lifestyles better, including illicit drug issues, and for planning and evaluation of drug prevention pro- grams in Male.

AB This work aimed to assess the fixed-bed adsorptive performance of a primary paper mill sludge-based granular activated carbon (PSA-PA) for the removal of pharmaceuticals, namely carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and paroxetine (PAR), from water. The breakthrough curves corresponding to the adsorption of CBZ at different flow rates and in two different matrices (distilled and municipal wastewater) were firstly determined, which allowed to select the most favorable flow rate for the subsequent experiments. The fixed-bed adsorption of CBZ, SMX and PAR from single and ternary solutions in wastewater showed that the performance of PSA-PA was different for each pharmaceutical. According to the obtained breakthrough curves, the poorest bed adsorption capacity, either from single or ternary solution, was observed for SMX, which may be related with electrostatic repulsion at the pH of the wastewater used (pH similar to 7.3-7.7). Also, the bed adsorption capacity of PSA-PA for SMX, in the ternary solution, was notoriously lower compared to the single solution, while it slightly decreased for CBZ and even increased for PAR. The regeneration studies showed that the CBZ adsorption capacity of the PSA-PA bed decreased about 38 and 71% after the first and the second thermal regeneration stages, respectively. This decline was comparatively larger than the corresponding reduction of the PSA-PA specific surface area (SBET), which decreased only 5 and 25% for the first and second regeneration stages, respectively, and pointed to the lack of viability of more than one regeneration stage.

AB Meloxicam is a commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and fever-reducing effects. In this study, photocatalytic degradation of meloxicam in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NP) was optimized and applied for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. A validated stability-indicating orthogonal testing protocol (reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC and capillary zone electrophoresis) was developed and validated for monitoring of meloxicam concentration in the presence of its photodegradation products. Fractional factorial design was employed in order to investigate the effects of pH, irradiation time, UV light intensity, TiO2NP loading, and initial meloxicam concentration on the efficiency of the process. The light intensity was found as the most significant parameter followed by irradiation time and concentration, respectively. The most influencing interactions were noted between irradiation time-concentration and irradiation time-light intensity. The kinetics of meloxicam degradation was investigated at the optimum set of experimental conditions. The protocol was successfully applied for treatment of incurred water samples collected during various cleaning validation cycles. A percentage degradation of 77.34 +/-0.02 % was achieved upon irradiation of samples containing 64.57+/-0.09 mu g/mL with UV light (1012 mu W/cm(2), 8 h) in the presence of 0.4 mg/mL TiO2NP at pH 9.0+/-0.05. Treatment of wastewaters collected during the cleaning validation of each product separately rather than the combined waste should result in a significant improvement in the economics of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. This could be attributed to the relatively small waste volumes and the ability to tailor the experimental conditions to achieve maximum efficiency.

AB A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two solar-driven advanced oxidation processes, namely heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis and homogeneous photo-Fenton, both coupled to biological treatment, is carried out in order to identify the environmentally preferable alternative to treat industrial wastewaters containing nonbiodegradable priority hazardous substances. The study is based on solar pilot plant tests using alpha-methyl-phenylglycine as a target substance. The LCA study is based on the experimental results obtained, along with data from an industrial-scale plant. The system under study includes production of the plant infrastructure, chemicals, electricity, transport of all these materials to the plant site, management of the spent catalyst by transport and landfilling, as well as treatment of the biodegradable effluent obtained in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant, and excess sludge treatment by incineration. Nine environmental impact categories are included in the LCA: global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic toxicity, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, eutrophication, energy consumption, and land use. The experimental results obtained in the pilot plant show that solar photo-Fenton is able to obtain a biodegradable effluent much faster than solar heterogeneous photocatalysis, implying that the latter would require a much larger solar collector area in an industrial application. The results of the LCA show that, an industrial wastewater treatment plant based on heterogeneous photocatalysis involves a higher environmental impact than the photo-Fenton alternative, which displays impact scores 80-90% lower in most impact categories assessed. These results are mainly due to the larger size of the solar collector field needed by the plant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The enantiomeric and diastereomeric profiling of chiral pharmaceuticals (ephedrine, norephedrine, atenolol and venlafaxine) and illicit drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA)) was undertaken over a period of fourteen consecutive days in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the city of Valencia, Spain. Degradation efficiency of WWTPs was found to be compound and enantiomer dependent. Selective enantiomer enrichment was observed for several target analytes. Amphetamine and MDMA were enriched with R(-)-enantiomers. 1S,2S(+)-pseudoephedrine was found to be more readily degradable during activated sludge treatment than its diastereomer 1R,2S(-)-ephedrine. Atenolol underwent enrichment with either S(-xr)- or R(+)-enantiomer in different WWTPs. This unexpected enantiomeric variation in the stereoselective degradation of atenolol could be attributed to different processes utilized during activated sludge treatment. The application of (enantiomeric) profiling of wastewater revealed usage patterns of chiral drugs in the Valencia region. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Olive oil production generates large amounts of recalcitrant compounds, the olive oil mill wastewater (OMWW), which represent one of the most contaminating effluents among those produced by the agrofood industries. Nowadays, this view has changed to one that recognizes the waste as a low-cost starting material rich in bioactive compounds, particularly biophenols, that can be extracted and applied as natural antioxidants for the food and pharmaceutical industries. The data reported in this paper indicate that the OMWW extracts, besides low molecular weight antioxidant phenolics such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, also contain phenolics with a molecular weight in the range of 600-5000 Da, which exhibit efficient scavenging activities against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. This group of phenolics includes, besides verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and an oxidized form of verbascoside, a number of higher molecular weight phenolics arising from oxidative polymerization of hydroxytyrosol and caffeic acid. Overall, these higher molecular weight phenolics prove to be, in some in vitro tests, more efficient scavengers of hydrophilic hydroxyl radicals than hydroxytyrosol, which could be used for industrial applications as natural nontoxic antioxidants.

AB This paper analyzes the fate of 71 priority and emerging organic contaminants all along the treatment trains of sewage sludge treatment facilities in Paris including dewatering by centrifugation, thermal dry-ing and anaerobic digestion. It aimed at proposing and applying a mass balances calculation methodology to each process and pollutant. This data validation strategy demonstrated the complexity to perform rep-resentative inlet/outlet sampling and analysis campaigns at industrial scales regarding organic com-pounds and to propose options to overcome this issue. Centrifugation and drying processes only implied physical mechanisms as phase separation and water elimination. Hence, correct mass balance were expected observed for organic contaminants if sampling and analysis campaigns were representa-tive. This was the case for hydrophobic and neutral compounds. For the other more hydrophilic and charged compounds, the mass balances were scarcely correct. Thus, the conventional sampling and ana-lytical practices used with sludge should be questioned and adapted to better take into account the high heterogeneity of sludge and the evolution of matrix effect within sludge treatment processes on microp-ollutant determination. For the biological anaerobic digestion process where degradations can occur and removals can be observed, the mass balances were deeply interpreted for 60 contaminants. This process contributed to the elimination above 70% of 21 detected compounds including 16 pharmaceuticals, 2 phthalates, 2 hormones and 1 perfluorinated compound. Removals of domperidone, propranolol, escitalo-pram, lidocaine, verapamil and cefoperazone under this condition were reported for the first time.

AB The present study evaluated the environmental risks to common carp (Cyprinus carpio) posed by glucocorticoids present in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. To gather information on the seasonal variations in glucocorticoid concentration, the authors sampled the effluent of a Japanese STP every other week for 12 mo. Six of 9 selected glucocorticoids were detected in the effluent, with clobetasol propionate and betamethasone 17-valerate detected at the highest concentrations and frequencies. The present study's results indicated that effluent glucocorticoid concentration may depend on water temperature, which is closely related to the removal efficiency of the STP or to seasonal variations in the public's use of glucocorticoids. In a separate experiment, to clarify whether glucocorticoids in environmental water increase susceptibility to bacterial infection in fish, the authors examined the responses to bacterial infection (Aeromonas veronii) of common carp exposed to clobetasol propionate. Clobetasol propionate exposure did not affect bacterial infection-associated mortality. In fish infected with A. veronii but not exposed to clobetasol propionate, head kidney weight and number of leukocytes in the head kidney were significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas these effects were not observed in infected fish exposed to clobetasol. This suggests that clobetasol propionate alleviated bacterial infection-associated inflammation. Together, these results indicate that susceptibility to bacterial infection in common carp is not affected by exposure to glucocorticoids at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB Occurrence, removal, consumption and environmental risks of sixteen antibiotics were investigated in several sewage treatment plants (STPs) featuring different treatment levels in Hong Kong, China. Cefalexin, ofloxacin and erythromycin-H2O were predominant with concentrations of 1020-5640, 142-7900 and 243-4740 ng/L in influent, respectively; their mass loads were comparable to levels reported in urban regions in China and were at the high end of the range reported for western countries. The target antibiotics behaved differently depending on the treatment level employed at the STPs and relatively higher removal efficiencies (>70%) were observed for cefalexin. cefotaxime, amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol during secondary treatment. beta-lactams were especially susceptible to removal via the activated sludge process while macrolides were recalcitrant (<20%) in the dissolved phase. Two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin (4%) and norfloxacin (52%), differed greatly in their removal efficiencies, probably because of disparities in their pk(a), values which resulted in different sorption behaviour in sludge. Overall antibiotic consumption in Hong Kong was back-calculated based on influent mass flows and compared with available prescription and usage data. This model was verified by a good approximation of 82% and 141% to the predicted consumption of total ofloxacin, but a less accurate estimate was obtained for erythromycin usage. Risk assessment indicated that algae are susceptible to the environmental concentrations of amoxicillin as well as the mixture of the nine detected antibiotics in receiving surface waters.

AB This study proposes a biofilm process to immobilize biogenic manganese oxide (BMO) and Pseudomonas putida MnB1 (BMO-MnB1), which shows excellent synergistic effects for 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) from secondary wastewater treatment effluent (WWTE). Modified granular activated carbon (M-GAC) was used as the packing carrier, inoculated with Pseudomonas putida MnB1 and Mn(II) to form the BMO-MnB1 biofilm. Feasibility tests were performed to compare the EE2 removal efficiency with that of the conventional biofilm process (BAC) for heterogeneous microbial communities. Results show that in the BAC, EE2 was removed mainly by adsorption, with biodegradation contributing only slightly to the overall performance. In contrast, the BMO-MnB1 biofilter outperformed the BAC. Furthermore, less than 4% of the total EE2 removed was extracted from the biofilter medium over 150 days of operation, confirming that EE2 was biodegraded by P. putida MnB1 or chemically oxidized by BMO. Our results suggest that BMO-MnB1 biofilm processes have high potential for practical applications in removal of endocrine disrupting compounds from wastewater effluent.

AB This is part two of a paper about the potential environmental impacts of treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharging to the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The WWTP uses conventional activated sludge with nitrification.
   The assessment was conducted over six months using a variety of established tests, including in vitro cell-based screening assays, as well as acute, chronic and full-life cycle in vivo exposures. Effluent monitoring included pharmaceutically active compounds and endocrine disrupting compounds.
   No tests reported significant toxicity. However, enhanced algal growth was observed in a Pseudokerchneriella subcapitata growth inhibition test. In full life-cycle fathead minnow exposure, liver-somatic index changes were noted in exposed fish - increases for males, decreases for females - and production of viable fry decreased. Neither alteration is thought biologically significant. Because the effluent is diluted substantially by the receiving water, the level of risk posed to aquatic receptors and the environment is probably negligible.

AB Fate and occurrence of 4 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, one serotonin-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor and one noradrenergic-dopamineric reuptake inhibitor and their human metabolites were determined in a German municipal wastewater treatment plant as well as in the Rhine River and selected tributaries. The enantiomeric fractions of venlafaxine and its metabolites were not altered during wastewater treatment and were similar in all river samples underlining that no appreciable biodegradation occurs. In the Rhine catchment area highest concentrations were detected for venlafaxine, citalopram and their human metabolites. Projected future climate change would lead to an increased portion of treated wastewater in rivers due to reduced discharges during low flow situations by the end of the 21st century.

AB A pilot-scale integrated membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system, consisted of hydrolysis/acidification pretreatment. MABR process and activated carbon adsorption post-processing, was designed to treat the high-loading mixed pharmaceutical wastewater. A study of MABR process was conducted to investigate the effect of aeration condition, circulation flow rate and water quality on performance over 260 days. The performances of these processes were evaluated by the removal efficiency of COD, BOD5, turbidity, NH4+-N and TN. MABR process could effectively remove above 90% of COD and 98% of ammonia. The capacities per unit volume of MABR could reach up to 1311 gCOD/m(3)d and 48.2 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(3)d with single membrane aeration, and the oxygen utilization rate could be as high as 45%. After post-processing, the effluent of integrated treatment MABR system kept stable with COD below 200 mg/L and NH4+-N below 3 mg/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Direct UV photolysis of the aqueous solutions of seven well-known pharmaceuticals was accomplished using a high-pressure mercury lamp. Within 30 min of irradiation, active substances of ranitidine and phthalylsulphathiazole were almost completely destructed, whereas paracetamol and novocaine were destroyed to a lesser extent. Stable organic products are not formed during the destruction of paracetamol, while the photolysis of sulphaguanidine leads to the formation of acetic acid, which was confirmed by means of H-1 NMR spectroscopy. It is concluded that UV photolysis may be used for initial wastewater treatment to remove the studied micropollutants.

AB This study aimed to evaluate treatment performance and membrane fouling of a lab-scale Sponge-MBR under the added ciprofloxacin (CIP) dosages (20; 50; 100 and 200 mu g L-1) treating hospital wastewater. The results showed that Sponge-MBR exhibited effective removal of COD (94-98%) during the operation period despite increment of CIP concentrations from 20 to 200 mu g L-1. The applied CIP dosage of 200 mu g L-1 caused an inhibition of microorganisms in sponges, i.e. significant reduction of the attached biomass and a decrease in the size of suspended flocs. Moreover, this led to deteriorating the denitrification rate to 3-12% compared to 35% at the other lower CIP dosages. Importantly, Sponge-MBR reinforced the stability of CIP removal at various added CIP dosages (permeate of below 13 mu g L-1). Additionally, the fouling rate at CIP dosage of 200 mu g L-1 was 30.6 times lower compared to the control condition (no added CIP dosage).

AB Trace levels of a variety of currently unregulated organic chemicals have been detected in treated wastewater effluents and surface waters that receive treated effluents. Many of these chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) originate from pharmaceuticals and personal care products that are used widely and that frequently are transported down the drain to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Actual effects of CECs on aquatic life have been difficult to document, although biological effects consistent with effects of some CECs have been noted. There is a critical need to find appropriate ways to screen wastewater sites that have the greatest potential of CEC risk to biota. Building on the work of several researchers, the authors present a screening framework, as well as examples based on the framework, designed to identify high-risk versus lower-risk sites that are influenced by WWTP effluent. It is hoped that this framework can help researchers, utilities, and the larger water resource community focus efforts toward improving CEC risk determinations and management of these risks.

AB p-Anisidine being a component of wastewater generated through dye and pharmaceutical industries is highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Therefore, its presence in wastewater requires prior treatment before its disposal from the point of safety of human and aquatic life. Fenton's oxidation is a type of advanced oxidation processes which is efficient, ecofriendly and reliable, and this was not studied for the removal of p-anisidine from wastewater. In this study, the effect of influent pH, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferrous ion (Fe2+) concentration on the removal of p-anisidine by Fenton's reagent was carried out on a laboratory scale. All samples were examined for initial and final concentrations of p-anisidine using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and also initial and final COD was analyzed. p-Anisidine shows maximum absorbance at 296 nm. At pH 2.5 and [H2O2]/[Fe2+] of 70:1 for the initial p-anisidine concentration of 0.5 mM and for 24 h reaction time, the maximum removal of p-anisidine was found to be 88.95% and maximum COD removal was 76.43%.

AB The wastewater treatment process, besides discharging pharmaceuticals into the environment, has been found to result in the formation of a variety of undescribed compounds. Here we investigate the laboratory scale chlorination of the commonly used anti-HIV drug Nevirapine, characterise its disinfection transformation products (DTPs), and using liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry, screen environmental surface water for these DTPs. Chlorination of Nevirapine was scaled up, fractioned by preparative chromatography and the fractions were tested in vitro for toxicity and anti-HIV activity. Nevirapine was found to be resistant to degradation at relevant chlorination levels, which may partially explain its ubiquitous presence in South African surface water. During simulated chlorination, a variety of DTPs with varying properties were formed, some of which were detected in the environment, close to wastewater treatment plants. Interestingly, some of these compounds, although not as toxic as Nevirapine, retained antiviral activity. Further purification and synthesis is required to fully characterise these novel molecules.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of ozonation with pharmaceutical compounds on membrane bioreactor (MBR). The result has shown that high concentrations of pharmaceutical contaminants have caused destruction of cell wall, thereby reducing mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS). It also resulted in high amounts of biopolymers in the presence of non-biodegradable pharmaceutical compound in MBR. As a result, biological removal decreased and membrane fouling happened. Ozonation treatment reached a chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal of 99.9% and caused better effluent quality. The MBR-ozonation process could achieve an acetaminophen and fluoxetine removal of around 98.4 and 57.83%, respectively.

AB The photodegradation of seven micropollutants commonly found in municipal wastewater, namely caffeine, carbamazepine, diuron, simazine, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan and 2,4-D, was investigated in pure water and secondary effluent to understand the direct and indirect photolysis of these compounds under natural sunlight irradiation. Sulfamethoxazole and triclosan were readily photodegraded with half-lives of 5.8 and 1.8 h, respectively, whilst the others were relatively resistant towards sunlight irradiation. Enhanced degradation was observed in secondary effluent compared with in the pure water matrix for all compounds, except for triclosan. It was confirmed that hydroxyl radicals played an important role in the photodegradation of the micropollutants while singlet oxygen may also play a role. The contribution of hydroxyl radical to the overall degradation of the five compounds that were resistant to direct sunlight accounted for 32%-70%. The impact of humic acid and nitrate, two known photo-sensitisers and wastewater components, on the photodegradation of the seven micropollutants in pure water was investigated under simulated solar radiation. The presence of nitrate promoted the photochemical loss of all seven micropollutants, however, humic acid caused promotion or inhibition, depending on the characteristics of the micropollutant. Humic acid enhanced the photolytic degradation of caffeine, sulfamethoxazole and diuron, while it hindered the photodegradation of the other four compounds by absorbing the available irradiation energy and/or reforming the parent compound. Furthermore, it was shown that there was only a small increase (up to 15%) in photodegradation of the compounds at 25 degrees C compared with that at 10 degrees C in the simulated system.

AB This work reports a full-scale study in which organic wastes were transformed by high-solid thermophilic anaerobic digestion (HSAD), into N fertilizers and organic fertilizers, i.e. digestate. The produced fertilizers were characterized over 42 months and their properties were discussed in comparisons with literature data. HSAD coupled with N stripping technology led to ammonia sulphate production having high N concentration (74 +/- 2 g kg-1 wet weight), neutral pH (6.8 +/- 1.3) and low traces of other elements. Digestate showed both higher carbon (C) content (314 +/- 30 g kg-1 on dry matter (DM) and biological stability than green composts, indicating good amendment properties. Digestate was also interesting for its N (77 +/- 3.7 g kg-1 dry matter-DM) content, half of it in the ammonia form, and P content (28 +/- 4.1 g kg-1 DM) that was 43% readily available as soluble P-orthophosphate. K content was low (6.5 +/- 1.3 g kg-1 DM), indicating poor fertilizing ability of digestate for this element. All organic pollutants investigated were much lower than the limits required for agricultural use and levels of some of them were lower than the content revealed for other organic matrices such as agricultural and energy crop digestates and compost. Emerging pollutants (i.e., pharmaceuticals) were tested as markers and they were found to be below the detection limit (<0.01 mg kg-1 DM) indicating very low content. The results obtained showed that HSAD coupled with N stripping allowed transforming sewage sludge into fertilizers and soil improvers exploitable in agriculture.

AB This work describes the design, optimization and validation of an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of 14 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in sewage sludge. A thorough optimization of the sample pre-treatment was carried out. As a result, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was combined with an in-situ clean-up stage and a filtration step. A combination of MilliQ (R) water/MeOH 95:5 (v/v) adjusted to pH 9 turned out to be the optimal solvent mixture for extraction. The instrumental part of the method presents a significant novelty based on a fully automated sample preparation for the analysis of PPCPs. It consisted of a direct immersion solid phase microextraction followed by on-fiber derivatization, online coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (DI-SPME-On-fiber derivatization - GC-MS). An isotope dilution approach was used for quantifying, which conferred high reliability to the method. This methodology was validated for 10 compounds with good analytical performance, limit of detection below 20 ng g(-1) and absolute recovery in the range of 30-70% for most of the compounds. It supposes an ecological analytical alternative for many routine analysis laboratories around the world. The developed method was applied to different real samples generated in both a pilot-scale thermal hydrolysis treatment plant and an anaerobic digester operated in mesophilic conditions. Salicylic acid and naproxen were found at concentrations above 1000 ng g(-1). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the reutilization of waste materials (scrap tires, sewage sludge, and wood chips) to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylenes/trichloroethylene/cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (BTEX/TCE/cis-DCE), plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and pharmaceutically active compound carbamazepine from artificially contaminated water. Different hybrid removal processes were developed: (1) 300mg/L BTEX+20mg/L TCE+10mg/L cis-DCE+tires+Pseudomonas sp.; (2) 250mg/L toluene+sewage sludge biochar+Pseudomonas sp.; (3) 100mg/L DEHP+tires+Acinetobacter sp.; and (4) 20mg/L carbamazepine+wood chips+Phanerochaete chrysosporium. For the hybrid process (1), the removal of xylenes, TCE, and cis-DCE was enhanced, resulted from the contribution of both physical adsorption and biological immobilization removal. The hybrid process (2) was also superior for the removal of DEHP and required a shorter time (2days) for the bioremoval. For the process (3), the biochar promoted the microbial immobilization on its surface and substantially enhanced/speed up the bioremoval of toluene. The fungal immobilization on wood chips in the hybrid process (4) also improved the carbamazepine removal considerably (removal efficiencies of 61.3 +/- 0.6%) compared to the suspended system without wood chips (removal efficiencies of 34.4 +/- 1.8%). These hybrid processes would not only be promising for the bioremediation of environmentally concerned contaminants but also reutilize waste materials as sorbents without any further treatment.

AB The occurrence of chemicals in sludge from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is of concern for human health and the environment. Legislations and regulations are put in place to minimize the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and arable land, e.g. via application of sewage sludge. Temporal trends analysis of sludge contaminants can be used to assess the effectiveness of such actions. Such analyses can be performed retrospectively, using sludge stored in environmental specimen banks, to investigate new or emerging environmental contaminants. The present study provides data from time-trend analyses of metals, persistent organic pollutants, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other organic compounds in sludge from Swedish. The analysis showed that sludge is a suitable matrix for time-trend studies and it can take on average 12 years (range, 5-26 years) to track an annual change of +/- 10% (with a power of 80%). Statistically significant trends were found for 18 out of the 77 compounds subjected to analysis, of which 75% showed decreasing trends. Triclosan and the antibiotic norfloxacin followed the same trend as the national recorded usage and decreased annually by 65% and 60%, respectively. The opposite was true for the methylsiloxanes, which showed an annual average increase of about 30%. A downward trend (about 20% year(-1)) was observed for the polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs 154 and 183), while PBDE 209 increased by 16%. Further measurements are required to determine if the substitution of PBDEs by chlorinated paraffins or organophosphorus compounds have resulted in increased concentrations of the latter in sludge.

AB Antibiotics as the severe contaminants of aqueous environments were received growing attention during the last decades. The current work is the first report on investigating the potency and efficiency of electrocoagulation process in the successful removal of metronidazole (MNZ) from pharmaceutical wastewater using response surface methodology based on central composite design. The applied method by optimizing the independent and combined effects of significant variables which affecting the EC process enhanced the removal efficiency of MNZ. Analysis of variance was applied to verify the significance of independent variables solely and their interactions. The best removal efficiency of 100% found under the optimal operating condition of initial MNZ concentration 21.6 mg L-1, pH 8.2, current density 6.0 mA cm(-2), inter-electrode distance 3 cm, and reaction time of 14.6 min. Isotherm investigations revealed that the Langmuir model with the R-2 of 0.994 best fitted to the obtained experimental equilibrium results. The fast adsorption of MNZ on the surface of Fe(OH)(3) and [Fe(OH)2] with the equilibrium time of 15 min confirmed that the kinetics of the electrocoagulation process follow the pseudo second-order model (R-2 = 0.962). The electrocoagulation process under the optimal operating condition revealed that the electrical energy consumption per each m(3) of treated pharmaceutical wastewater, per each g of MNZ, removed, and per each kg of Fe electrode consumed, were found to be 0.516 kWh m(-3), 0.0234 kWh g(-1), and 0.0436 kWh kg(-1), respectively.

AB The occurrence of four widely used and endocrine disrupting parabens (PBs) (methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben and benzylparaben) and a polar UV filter (benzophenone-4) were determined in influent and effluent wastewater from the 19 major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Catalonia, Spain. For their analysis an on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated. Laboratory analysis revealed high levels for both PBs and BP4, with maximum concentrations of 5700 ng L-1 and 1806 ng L-1, respectively, in influent samples, and 137 ng L-1 and 1080 ng L-1, respectively in effluent wastewaters. Removal rates (RE%) for the target compounds in each WWTPs were calculated. RE% for parabens were almost 100%, whereas for BP4 values where in the range 5-91%. The half-life time (t(1/2)), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and annual mass load (ML) for each facility was estimated. Results indicated that there was no clear influence of HRT on the RE% of BP4. MLs for BP4 were in the range 0.9-110.1 kg y(-1), with the highest values in the most populated areas. Finally, a risk assessment, estimated in terms of hazard quotients (HQs), was carried out for aquatic biota. HQs for the target compounds in effluent wastewaters indicated a negligible effect, whereas for some influent wastewaters' HQs pointed out that some species are at risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are constantly released into natural waters, mainly from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) whose processes are unable to completely eliminate them. Among these drugs, the occurrence of benzimidazoles, a class of antiparasitics for human and veterinary use, has been reported in WWTP effluents and surface waters. In this study, an SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and optimized for extraction and quantitation of benzimidazoles in influents and effluents of a local WWTP and in hospital wastewater. The extraction procedure was optimized using response surface methodology (Box-Behnken design) and the optimal parameters were as follows: 2.0 mL of loading solvent consisting of a mixture of water:methanol (95:5, v/v) and temperature at 43 degrees C. In hospital wastewater, albendazole (ABZ) and its principal metabolite ricobendazole (RBZ) were the main benzimidazole-related contaminants and were found at concentrations of up to 3810 and 3894 ng L-1, respectively. The WWTP system was able to remove from 46% to 95% of the ABZ quantified in the influent, discharging an effluent with 16-441 ng L-1 of ABZ. The concentrations of other benzimidazoles and metabolites in the WWTP effluents remained below 350 ng L-1. WWTP effluents fortified with 50 mu g L-1 of ABZ required 26.7 mg(o3) L-1 to remove ABZ and RBZ. After ozonation, the COD and BOD5 of the effluents were reduced by 27%. Photolysis by UVA radiation was not effective to remove ABZ and FBZ from the effluent samples.

AB In this work, a multi-class analytical method for determination of 22 frequently used pharmaceuticals was developed and validated. Analytes were from different classes for example macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, anthelmintics, anesthetics, and others. Method was intended for analysis of aqueous samples so the sample preparation was done using solid-phase extraction (SPE). Different sorbents (C8, C18, polymeric, and ion exchange sorbents) combining different eluents (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate) were investigated during development of sample preparation step. Samples were analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS, and therefore, chromatographic and mass spectrometer conditions were investigated. Optimal extraction efficiencies for most of the investigated analytes were obtained with Oasis HLB polymeric sorbents with acetonitrile as eluent. A study of matrix effect was carried out for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent. The method was validated for linearity, detection limits and quantification limits, repeatability, and reproducibility. Method detection limits were in the range of 2.0-204.0 ng L-1 for WWTP influent except for sulfaguanidine and dexamethasone. Also, method detection limits for WWTP effluent were from 1.0 to 115.4 ng L-1. Method was successfully applied for analysis of real wastewater samples from municipal wastewater treatment plant. In the influent, pharmaceuticals from all investigated groups were present and the concentrations were from 50.0 to 4914.3 ng L-1 for influent and 26.9 to 1699.2 ng L-1 for effluent. It was also reported that some pharmaceuticals showed higher concentrations in the wastewater effluent than in the influent.

AB Secondary treated urban wastewater was further polished by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and the water quality of RO permeates was assessed for their utilizations in agricultural irrigation. The performances of brackish water reverse osmosis (AK-BWRO) and seawater reverse osmosis (AD-SWRO) membranes were investigated at 10 bar as applied pressure. The AD-SWRO membrane was tested also at 20 bar. Conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) and color were rejected by AK-BWRO membrane with average values of 94.6%, 95.2%, 85.8%, 76.4% and 91.3%, respectively, whereas the same contaminants were rejected with average values of 98.3%, 98.3%, 84.6%, 69.7% and 86.6%, respectively with AD-SWRO membrane. Except for TOC, AD-SWRO membrane showed similar rejections at 10 bar and at 20 bar of applied pressures. Although their rejection efficiencies were similar, AK-BWRO and AD-SWRO membranes revealed differences in their permeate flux which is 38.0 L/hm(2) for AK-BWRO membrane and 3.81 L/hm(2) for AD-SWRO membrane. An average value of permeate flux was 14.8 L/hm(2) at 20 bar for AD-SWRO membrane. Assessment of water quality of product water obtained by blending of the two effluents (secondary treated urban wastewater and RO permeate) based on salinity, electrical conductivity, specific ionic toxicity and miscellaneous hazards proved that blending of 20-30% of secondary treated effluent and 80-70% of RO permeate is a good strategy to minimize the unwanted components in treated water for its reuse in agricultural irrigation.

AB Several studies showed that some organic micropollutants (OMPs) are biotransformed during anaerobic digestion (AD). Yet, most of them aim at reporting removal efficiencies instead of understanding the biotransformation process. Indeed, how each of the main AD stages (i.e., hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis) contribute to OMP biotransformation remains unknown. This study focuses on investigating the role of methanogenesis, the most characteristic step of AD, to OMP removal. More specifically, the sorption and the biotransformation of 20 OMPs by methanogenic biomass were analyzed determining their concentrations in both liquid and solid phases. Sorption onto methanogenic biomass displayed a similar behavior as reported for digested sludge. Most of the OMPs were biotransformed to a medium extent (35-70%) and only sulfamethoxazole was completely removed. Comparing these results with those reported for the complete AD process, methanogenesis was proven to play a key role, accounting for more than 50% of the OMP biotransformation (except for roxithromycin) during AD. An increase in the organic loading rate from 1 to 2 g COD/L d, typical loads employed in sewage sludge anaerobic digesters, did not exert a clear cometabolic effect on the OMPs biotransformation. It is hypothesized that biotransformation occurs in both liquid and solid phases because no link between the partition coefficient (Kd) and the overall biotransformation efficiency was found. These findings allow a better understanding of the OMPs fate under anaerobic conditions, which is necessary to design efficient biological mitigation strategies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) along with illicit drugs (IDs) are newly recognized classes of environmental pollutants and are receiving considerable attention because of their environmental impacts: frequent occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic life and humans. However, relatively little information is often available with regard to their possible biotic and abiotic transformation products (TPs). This lack of knowledge has resulted in a substantial amount of ongoing effort to develop methods and approaches that would assess their occurrence, degradability potential elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in sewage treatment plants as well as environmental and human health risks. In this article, an extensive literature survey was performed in order to present the current stage of knowledge and progress made in the occurrence of TPs of PPCPs and IDs in raw and treated wastewaters. Apart from the TPs resulting from structural transformations of the parent compound in the aquatic environment or in technological treatment facilities (e.g. sewage and drinking water treatment plants), free metabolites and drug conjugates formed during human metabolism have also been included in this review as they are also released into the aquatic environment through wastewaters. Their concentration levels were reported in influents and effluents of WWTPs, hospital effluents and their removals in the treatment plants were discussed. Finally, information on the toxicity of TPs has been compiled when available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in different water bodies and the findings of effects on aquatic organisms in ecotoxicity tests have raised concerns about environmental risks of pharmaceuticals in receiving waters. Due to the fact that the amount of ecotoxicological studies has increased significantly during the last decade, probabilistic approaches for risk characterization of these compounds may be feasible. This approach was evaluated by applying it to 22 human-used pharmaceuticals covering both pharmaceuticals with a high volume and high ecotoxicity, using ecotoxicological effect data from laboratory studies and comparing these to monitoring data on the effluents from sewage treatment plants in Europe and pharmaceutical sales quantities. We found that for 19 of the 22 selected pharmaceuticals the existing data were sufficient for probabilistic risk characterizations. The subsequently modeled ratios between monitored concentrations and low-effect concentrations were mostly above a factor of 100. Compared to the current paradigm for EU environmental risk assessment where a safety factor of 10 or 100 might have been used it seems that for the modeled compounds there's a low environmental risk. However, similarly calculated ratios for five pharmaceuticals (propranolol, ibuprofen, furosemide, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were below 100. while ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin are considered to be of high concern due to lack of ecotoxicity studies. This paper shows that by applying probabilistic approaches, existing data can be used to execute a comprehensive study on probability of impacts, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals.

TI Size-dependent sensitivity of stream amphipods indicates

SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
LA English

DE body size; Gammaridae; Micropollutants; multiple stressors; wastewater
AB Global change assessments have typically ignored synthetic chemical pollution, despite the rapid increase of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals in the environment. The paucity of research on the ecological effects of these micropollutants undermines our efforts to address the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Understanding the responses of individual organisms to chemical pollution should help address this knowledge gap because individual-level effects can cascade across populations, communities, and ecosystems with devastating consequences.
   Inputs of treated municipal wastewater are a major source of micropollutants in receiving environments. Here, we assessed population and individual-level influences of treated wastewater on freshwater gammarid amphipods (Gammarus spp.) in Swiss lowland streams in situ and tested effects of a micropollutant mixture on individual Gammarus fossarum using a common garden laboratory experiment. We hypothesised that population-level effects of wastewater are mediated through asymmetric sensitivities of juvenile and adult gammarids to chemical pollutants. We expected that life-stage specific sensitivities would reflect allometric theory relating body size to a wide range of organismal characteristics, including metabolism, growth, and mortality.
   At the population level (i.e. field survey), we observed greatly reduced abundances of juvenile gammarids downstream of the wastewater discharge in three of the six sites surveyed, indicating the potential for demographic effects of pollution. At the individual level in a field transplant experiment, we found that the presence of wastewater led to a steeper positive relationship between gammarid body size and leaf consumption. In the laboratory experiment, we found that micropollutants had negative effects on consumption and growth rates, but a positive effect on survival. Differences in the relationship between gammarid body size and performance were subtle across treatments, although flatter slopes in growth appear to be a consistent response to chemical pollution. Faster growth rates appeared to be connected with reduced survival, placing individuals in control treatments and/or with smaller body size at greatest risk of mortality. Notably, juvenile gammarids had faster growth rates and lower survival than adults when exposed to micropollutants.
   Our results demonstrate the potential for negative impacts of micropollutants in freshwater ecosystems. However, the results also show that organismal responses to chemical pollutants can be complex, whereby impacts at the individual level may act counter-intuitively to population-level dynamics. This highlights the need for more realistic experiments to better assess how organismal responses depend on life stage and body size, and how individual-level effects propagate to higher levels of biological organisation. Our study shows how allometric theory can be used to examine the effects of stressors on underlying organismal biology, population demographics, and link with broader macroecological patterns.

AB Background: In situ exposure of rainbow trout up-and downstream of differently equipped wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and subsequent analyses of micronuclei frequencies and hepatic EROD activities were used to evaluate the impact of the effluents on fish health. Two of the facilities (WWTPs A and B) were conventional treatment plants. WWTP C has been equipped with a powdered activated carbon stage. Here, analyses were conducted prior and subsequent to this upgrade.
   Results: Differences did not only occur when comparing conventional (WWTPs A, B and C prior to the upgrade) and advanced treatment (WWTP C after the upgrade), but also between the conventionally equipped WWTPs. There was no indication for genotoxic effects or pollution-related EROD induction in fish exposed at WWTP A. In contrast, trout exposed at WWTP B expressed strong reactions. However, here, adverse reactions were also observed in fish kept upstream. Similar observations were made for EROD activities in fish exposed at WWTP C prior to the upgrade, whereas genotoxic effects could only be seen in trout kept downstream of this effluent. Upgrading of WWTP C resulted in a significant reduction of both genotoxic effects and EROD levels.
   Conclusions: The results show financial investments in advanced wastewater treatment to be beneficial for aquatic ecosystems, especially when conventional technologies do not sufficiently remove pollutants. Yet, negative impacts of effluents on aquatic organisms can, under certain conditions, also be avoided by conventional treatment. Therefore, we recommend deciding on the necessity and the type of WWTP upgrading on a case-by-case basis.

AB Municipal wastewater discharges constitute a major source of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) to coastal waters, yet uncertainty exists regarding their linkage to adverse biological effects such as endocrine disruption. Limited information is available concerning the types and fate of CECs discharged to the Southern California Bight (SCB) from municipal wastewater and their potential for ecological impacts. The present study investigated the impacts of CECs from ocean wastewater discharges on SCB fish. Concentrations of CECs were measured in effluents from four major municipal wastewater dischargers. Seawater, sediment, and hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) from the discharge sites and a reference area were collected and analyzed for chemical and biological indicators. Low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial and commercial compounds were measured in effluent. Some CECs were also detected in sediment, seawater, and fish livers near the outfalls, confirming exposure to CECs. Fish plasma hormone analyses suggested the presence of physiological effects, including a reduced stress response, altered estrogen synthesis or estrogenic exposure, and reduced thyroxine. Most fish responses were found at all sites and could not be directly associated with effluent discharges. However, concentrations of thyroxine were lower at all discharge sites relative to the reference, and estradiol concentrations were lower at three of the four outfall sites. The physiological responses found were not associated with adverse impacts on fish reproduction or populations. Interpretation of molecular and physiological measurements in field organisms such as those used in the present study is challenging because of a lack of information on baseline conditions and uncertain linkages to apical endpoints such as survival and reproduction.

AB Removal of pharmaceutical Carbamazepine (CBZ) compound from municipal wastewater has become an issue from the human health and environmental risks point of view, due to its latent recalcitrance and toxicity properties. This study investigated the photodegradation performance of a sequential batch annular slurry photoreactor (SB-ASP) system for the removal of CBZ compound from secondary municipal wastewater. Two different immobilised TiO(2) photocatalysts, namely anatase titanate nanofiber and mesoporous TiO(2) impregnated kaolinite catalyst were applied in the SB-ASP system. Various modes of sequential batch reactor (SBR) cycles, presence of effluent organic matter (EOM) and inorganic ions, mainly nitrate and phosphate that could affect the photodegradation performance of the SB-ASP system were evaluated during the removal of CBZ. High performance size exclusion chromatography revealed that the photocatalytic reaction will preferentially compete and attack on high molecular weight EOM prior to the photodegradation of CBZ. The presence of inorganic ions was found to affect the surface fouling of immobilised photocatalysts used to a different extent, without completely retarding their photoactivity. This study also highlighted that the operation of SB-ASP system was useful to enhance the photodegradation of CBZ compound in a semi-continuous operation without constant catalyst replacement. It is foreseeable that the integration of SB-ASP system with biological treatment systems could provide an advanced treatment option for the recycling and reuse of municipal wastewater.

AB Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can purify wastewater, they also discharge numerous contaminants into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal. The occurrence, emission flux, and risk assessment of traditional pollutants (e.g., heavy metals [HMs]), and emerging pollutants (e.g., perfluoroalkyl substances [PFASs] and pharmaceutical and personal care products [PPCPs]) in WWTP emissions are of important concern. The present study analyzed 17 PFASs, 25 PPCPs, and 8 HMs in influent, effluent, and excess sludge from six WWTPs along the Yanghe River, North China. Samples were collected during four sampling campaigns from November 2016 to July 2017. The mean concentrations of PFASs and PPCPs in influent were 46.4 ng L-1 and 6.57 mu g L--1,L- respectively; while those in effluent were 38.5 ng L-1 and 2.14 mu g L-1, respectively. The highest concentrations of HMs was detected of Zn in influent (2,866 mu g L-1) and effluent (3,960 mu g L-1). According to the concentration composition, short-chain PFASs, fluoroquinolones (FQs), and Zn were the predominant components in both influents and effluents. The mean PFAS and PPCP concentrations in excess sludge were 5.95 ng g(-1) and 3.74 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw). Zn was the most abundant HMs in excess sludge with the concentration range of 156-14,271 mu g g(-1) dw. The compositions of PFASs, PPCPs and HMs differed between wastewater and excess sludge. The estimated emission flux of these pollutants was ordered as HMs > PPCPs> PFASs through effluent discharge and sludge disposal. Sludge disposal discharged more PPCPs and HMs into the environment than effluent discharge, which was contrary for PFASs. Relative risk of each pollutant is calculated by comparing the mean effluent concentration with the median effective concentration. Algae and fish were selected as recipient organisms to calculate the relative risk of 23 selected pollutants towards aquatic organisms. The highest-risk pollutant was Zn on both algae and fish, while perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and atenolol (ATE) posed the lowest risk. In general, HMs (regarded as traditional pollutants) presented higher risks in effluent, followed by the emerging pollutants (PPCPs and PFASs). Therefore, control of traditional pollutants should be prioritized in WWTPs in this region. This study presents an overall assessment of the current status of traditional and emerging pollutants in WWTPs and provides useful information for upgrading wastewater treatment processes.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) reaching surface waters through municipal wastewater are a concern, as existing treatment processes poorly remove them. While significant lab-scale evaluations have been performed on treatment options, full-scale tests are lacking. Presented is an experimental study from a full-scale research facility that is imbedded in a functioning municipal wastewater plant. Reverse osmosis and ozonation were tested as part of an active treatment train using secondary treated effluent from the adjoining facility. Reverse osmosis removed 92.6%, 99.0%, 99.6%, 97.8%, 99.0%, 99.6%, 99.9%, and 99.2% of metformin, cotinine, trimethoprim, caffeine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, erythromycin, and fluoxetine, respectively. By ozone, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, erythromycin and o-desmethylvenlafaxine were removed by more than 99.9%. Trimethoprim and venlafaxine were removed by more than 95%, with the remaining compounds removed by between 16% and 85%. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of reverse osmosis and ozonation for full-scale treatment.

AB The treated wastewater consists of refractory materials and high organic content of hydrolyzed peptone residues from pharmaceutical factory. The combination of electrocoagulation (EC) followed by heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO2) conditions was maximized. The EC: iron cathode/anode (12.50 cm x 2.50 cm x 0.10 cm), current density 763 A m(-2), 90 min and initial pH 6.0. As EC consequence. the majority of the dissolved organic and suspended material was removed (about 91% and 86% of the turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively). After EC, refractory residues still remained in the effluent. The subsequent photocatalysis: UV/TiO2/H2O2 (mercury lamps), pH 3.0, 4h irradiation, 0.25 g L-1 TiO2 and 10 mmol L-1 H2O2 shows high levels of inorganic and organic compounds eliminations. The obtained COD values: 1753 mg L-1 for the sample from the factory, 160 mg L-1 after EC and 50 mg L-1 after EC/photocatalyzed effluents pointed out that the combined treatment stresses this water purification.

AB A novel environmentally benign method was developed for the simultaneous removal of sulphonamides and multiclass class of veterinary drugs using mesoporous nanofibers. Processing parameters which affect the removal efficiency, such as pH, initial analyte concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time were studied. An optimised method was applied to a real wastewater samples collected from Daspoort Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), South Africa. Under optimumconditions, the removal efficiency of veterinary drugs fromeffluent and influent ranged from35.24-94.57 +/- 0.24 and 31.71-76.91 +/- 0.65 mg g(-1), respectively. The surface area, cumulative volume of pores and average pore diameter of the nanofibers were determined as 2402.62 +/- 13.62 m(2) g(-1), 2.04 cm(3) g(-1) and 3.39 nm, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity was ranged from 166 to 1000mg g(-1). The adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second-order rate equation suggesting that particle diffusion was the rate-limiting mechanism for adsorption of veterinary drugs on electrospun nanofibers.

AB An integrated workflow based on liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-QTOF-MS) was developed and applied to detect and identify suspect and unknown contaminants in Greek wastewater. Tentative identifications were initially based on mass accuracy, isotopic pattern, plausibility of the chromatographic retention time and MS/MS spectral interpretation (comparison with spectral libraries, in silico fragmentation). Moreover, new specific strategies for the identification of metabolites were applied to obtain extra confidence including the comparison of diurnal and/or weekly concentration trends of the metabolite and parent compounds and the complementary use of HMO. Thirteen of 284 predicted and literature metabolites of selected pharmaceuticals and nicotine were tentatively identified in influent samples from Athens and seven were finally confirmed with reference standards. Thirty four nontarget compounds were tentatively identified, four were also confirmed. The sulfonated surfactant diglycol ether sulfate was identified along with others in the homologous series (SO4C2H4(OC2H4)(x)OH), which have not been previously reported in wastewater. As many surfactants were originally found as nontargets, these compounds were studied in detail through retrospective analysis.

AB Widespread use of pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines has been resulting over the last decades in the dissemination of residues of these compounds in the environment, and such fact has been raising increasing concern. The generally low efficiencies of conventional wastewater treatment processes for the removal of this type of pollutants demands for the development of alternative or complementary water and wastewater treatment technologies, among which adsorption processes have been gaining popularity, provided that cheap efficient adsorbents are found. Clay materials have been one of the popular choices in this regard. In the present study, quantum chemical calculations have been performed by periodic DFT using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method to characterize the interactions of two benzodiazepine molecules, alprazolam and diazepam, with a surface of clay mineral, vermiculite. It was observed that both molecules interact strongly with the vermiculite surface, both through a water-bridge binding and by cation-bridge provided by the exchangeable Mg2+ cations of the vermiculite surface. The results point to an interesting potential of vermiculite to be used efficiently as filter medium to remove these pollutants from water and wastewater.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the innate immunity of goldfish exposed to reuse water, and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, using a real-time flow-through exposure system. The reuse water generated by ultrafiltration of finished wastewater from the municipal wastewater treatment plant was analyzed for the presence of a panel of 20 herbicides/fungicides and 46 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). There was a seasonal variation in the profile and concentrations of xenobiotics in reuse water with lowest levels occurring in the summer. The innate immunity parameters assessed were cytokine (IFN gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF alpha 2), and cytokine receptor (TNFR1, TNFR2, IFNGR1, IFNGR2) gene expression, and phagocytosis of kidney leukocyte subpopulations. Assessment of innate immunity parameters was done after acute (7 days) and sub chronic (30 and 60 days) exposure to reuse water, UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, and activated carbon-treated reuse water (ACT; control), during spring, summer and fall of 2012. Temporal (acute versus sub chronic) as well as seasonal differences in innate immunity of fish exposed to reuse water were observed. The acute exposure of fish to reuse water caused significant down-regulation in cytokine gene expression in different organs of fish (kidney, spleen, liver) and phagocytic ability of different kidney leukocyte subpopulations. The immune gene expression and phagocytosis of kidney leukocytes of fish returned to ACT control levels after sub chronic exposure suggesting that fish have habituated to the reuse water exposure. The changes in gene expression after acute exposure were related to variations in the profile of xenobiotics in reuse water during different seasons. The efficiency of xenobiotic removal using UV/H2O2 ranged between 1.6 and 100% indicating that treatment of reuse water using high dose UV/H2O2 was only partially effective in removing the xenobiotics, as assessed by both chemical analyses and measurement of innate immune responsiveness of the fish. Furthermore, exposure of fish to reuse water and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water generated in the spring and fall caused greater changes in innate immunity after acute exposure, compared to fish exposed to ACT reuse water, indicating that the remediation of reuse water, should be considered in order to protect aquatic and public health.

AB Pharmaceutical contaminants in environment induce unexpected effects on ecological systems and human; thus, development of efficient technologies for their removal is immensely necessary. In this study, biodegradation and metabolic fate of a frequently found pharmaceutical contaminant, doxylamine by Typha angustifolia and Ipomoea aquatica was investigated. Microbial community of the plant rhizosphere has been identified to understand the important roles of the functional microbes. The plants reduced 48-80.5 % of doxylamine through hydrolysis/dehydroxylation and carbonylation/decarbonylation. A constructed phytobed co-planted with T. angustifolia and I. aquatica removed 77.3 %, 100 %, 83.67 %, and 61.13 % of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and doxylamine respectively from real wastewater. High-throughput sequencing of soil and rhizosphere indicated that the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria dominated the microbial communities of the phytobed. Current study has demonstrated the applicability of the developed phytobeds for the treatment of doxylamine from municipal wastewater and provide a comprehensive understanding of its metabolism through plant and its rhizospheric microbial communities.

AB To treat waste with waste and efficiently remove the organic pollutant, waste palladiums(ii) were adsorbed and reduced on microorganism surface to catalyze the reductive removal of ciprofloxacin in pharmaceutical wastewater. By optimizing conditions such as pH and temperature, the amount of biogenic palladium adsorbed and reduced onE. colireached 139.48 mg g(-1)(Pd/microorganisms). Moreover, most of the Pd(ii) was reduced to nanometer-sized Pd(0) as characterized by TEM and SEM with EDXA. Using the obtained biogenic palladium, the reductive removal of ciprofloxacin is up to 87.70% at 25 degrees C, 3.03 folds of that achieved in the absence of H-2. The results show that wasteE. colimicroorganisms can efficiently adsorb and remove waste Pd(ii) and produce Bio-Pd nanoparticle catalysts in the presence of H-2. This biogenic palladium presents high catalytic activity and great advantages in the reductive degradation of ciprofloxacin. Our method can also be applied to other waste metal ions to prepare the biogenic metals, facilitate their recovery and reuse in degrading organic pollutants in wastewater to achieve "treating waste using waste".

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are considered to be a major source for the release in the aquatic environment of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Ozone has proved to be a suitable solution for polishing secondary domestic effluents. In this work, the performance of a full-scale ozonation plant was investigated in order to assess the removal efficiency of four target EDCs: nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate, nonylphenol diethoxylate and bisphenol A. The studied system was the tertiary treatment stage of a municipal WWTP which receives an important industrial (textile) load. Chemical analyses showed that the considered substances occurred with a significant variability, typical of real wastewaters; based on this, ozonation performance was carefully evaluated and it appeared to be negatively affected by flow-rate increase (during rainy days, with consequent contact time reduction). Moreover, EDCs' measured removal efficiency was lower than what could be predicted based on literature data, because of the relatively high residual content of biorefractory compounds still present after biological treatment.

AB Advanced oxidation treatment using low pressure UV light coupled with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) was evaluated for the oxidation of six pharmaceuticals in three wastewater effluents. The removal of these six pharmaceuticals (meprobamate, carbamazepine, dilantin, atenolol, primidone and trimethoprim) varied between no observed removal and >90%. The role of the water quality (i.e., alkalinity, nitrite, and specifically effluent organic matter (EfOM)) on hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) exposure was evaluated and used to explain the differences in pharmaceutical removal between the three wastewaters. Results indicated that the efficacy of UV/H2O2 treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater was a function of not only the concentration of EfOM but also its inherent reactivity towards (OH)-O-center dot. The removal of pharmaceuticals also correlated with reductions in ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), which offers utilities a surrogate to assess pharmaceutical removal efficiency during UV/H2O2 treatment.

AB Chiral pharmaceutically active compounds (cPACs) are not currently governed by environmental regulation yet are expected to be in the future. As cPACs can exert stereospecific toxicity in the aquatic environment, it is essential to better understand their stereoselective behaviour here. Therefore, this study aims to provide a new perspective towards comprehensive evaluation of cPACs at a river catchment level, including their stereochemistry as a chemical phenomenon driving fate of chiral molecules in the environment. A large spatial and temporal monitoring program was performed in Southwest England. It included 5 sewage treatment works and the receiving waters of the largest river catchment in Southwest England. Simultaneously, lab-scale microcosm studies in simulated activated sludge bioreactors and river water microcosm were performed to evaluate stereoselective degradation of cPACs. A multi-residue enantioselective method allowed the analysis of a total of 18 pairs of enantiomers and 3 single enantiomers in wastewater and river water samples.
   Our monitoring program revealed: (1) spatial and temporal variations of cPACs in influent wastewaters resulting from different patterns of usage as well as an (2) enantiomeric enrichment of cPACs, likely due to human metabolism, despite their commercialization as racemic mixtures. A similar chiral signature was observed in effluent and receiving waters. Stereoselective degradation was observed in trickling filters (TF) for naproxen, ketoprofen, cetirizine and 10,11-dihydroxy-10-hydroxycarbamazepine, in sequencing batch reactors (SBR) for ifosfamide and in activated sludge (AS) for cetirizine. The extent of enantiomer-specific fate was wastewater treatment dependent in the case of naproxen (TF showed higher stereoselectivity than AS and SBR) and cetirizine (TF and AS showed higher stereoselectivity than SBR) due to differing microbial population. Furthermore, stereoselective degradation of naproxen was highly variable among STWs using similar treatments (TF) and operating in the same region. Microbial stereoselective degradation was also confirmed by both activated and river water simulated microcosm for chloramphenicol, ketoprofen, indoprofen, naproxen and 10,11-dihydroxy-10-hydroxycarbamazepine. Results from our large scale river catchment monitoring study and lab simulated microcosm show wide-ranging implications of enantiomerism of cPACs on environmental risk assessment (ERA). As two enantiomers of the same compound show different biological effects (e.g. toxicity), their non-racemic presence in the environment might lead to inaccurate ERA. This is because current ERA approaches do not require analysis at enantiomeric level.

AB The very wide range of activities performed in hospitals (care, diagnosis, hygiene, maintenance, research) require the use of a large variety of potentially ecotoxic substances such as surfactants, metals, disinfectants and pharmaceuticals. This study aimed to determine oxidative stress in the common carp Cyprinus carpio induced by hospital wastewater (HWW) in Mexico. The median lethal concentration (LC50) and subsequently the lowest observed adverse effect level were determined. Carp were exposed to the latter value (0.5 %) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and the following biomarkers were evaluated in gill, brain, liver and blood: hydroperoxide content (HPC), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, protein carbonyl content (PCC) and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Significant increases in HPC, MDA content and PCC were observed in exposed specimens, particularly in gill, liver and brain. SOD and CAT activity also increased in liver and brain. In conclusion, this particular HWW induces oxidative stress on C. carpio, this damage being most evident in gill, liver and brain.

AB The high levels of parabens (including methyl-, ethyl- and propyl congeners), triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) used every year in China might be a problem to the typical wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This study addresses measurements of parabens, TCC and TCS Northern China WWTP and a modelling assessment on the occurrence, fate and removal pathways in WWTP. Per-capita emissions of the three parabens, TCC and TCS to the WWTP were estimated as 0.41, 0.11 and 0.07 mg/d. After the wastewater treatment processes, 94, 92 and 87% of parabens, TCC and TCS were removed. The major removal pathway of parabens was biodegradation while that of TCC and TCS were sorption to sludge. Computer simulations on the fate processes of parabens, TCC and TCS in the WWTP using the SimpleTreat 4.0 model suggested the model could generally reproduce the measurements with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 10 ng/L. However, the model underestimated the removal of TCC and TCS from water to sludge in the primary tank. These discrepancies were attributed to the uncertainty of the predicted organic carbon-water partition coefficients (K-oc) to which the modelling results are highly sensitive. The model predictions using updated K-oc became more accurate and RMSEs of TCC and TCS were reduced by 40 and 80%, respectively. The modelling assessment suggests that the SimpleTreat, as a generic model to simulate chemical fate processes in WWTPs, has the potential to be applied to other similar WWTPs in China for estimating environmental releases of parabens, TCC and TCS at a larger spatial scale.

AB Open-water cells in unit process treatment wetlands can be used to exploit sunlight photolysis to remove trace organic contaminants from municipal wastewater effluent. To assess the performance of these novel systems, a photochemical model was calibrated using measured photolysis rates for atenolol, carbamazepine, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole in wetland water under representative conditions. Contaminant transformation by hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and carbonate radical ((CO3-)-C-center dot) were predicted from steady-state radical concentrations measured at pH values between 8 and 10. Direct photolysis rates and the effects of light screening by dissolved organic matter on photolysis rates were estimated using solar irradiance data, contaminant quantum yields, and light screening factors. The model was applied to predict the land area required for 90% removal of a suite of wastewater-derived organic contaminants by sunlight-induced reactions under a variety of conditions. Results suggest that during summer, open-water cells that receive a million gallons of water per day (i.e., about 4.4 x 10(-2) m(3) s(-1)) of nitrified wastewater effluent can achieve 90% removal of most compounds in an area of about 15 ha. Transformation rates were strongly affected by pH, with some compounds exhibiting faster transformation rates under the high pH conditions associated with photosynthetic algae at the sediment water interface and other contaminants exhibiting faster transformation rates at the circumneutral pH values characteristic of algae-free cells. Lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations typically resulted in increased transformation rates.

AB Colistin is a peptide antibiotic widely used as a food additive in animal farming, specially swine and poultry, and also has recently been applied in human medicine to treat infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative bacteria strains. When orally administered, colistin is eliminated in feces virtually unaltered; thus, it may reach water bodies and wastewater treatment facilities in its active form. Apart from the risks associated with development of antimicrobial resistance and environmental toxicity issues, the presence of antimicrobials in wastewater can, additionally, interfere in biological processes commonly used to treat them. Nitrifying bacteria are among the most sensitive microorganisms to inhibitory compounds, including pharmaceuticals, and are useful as biosensors to access contaminant toxicity information in wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, in order to assess the colistin acute toxicity to the microorganisms involved in the nitrification processes, the nitritation and nitratation kinetics were monitored under different colistin concentrations. The results showed that only ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic, presenting an IC50 of 10.8 mg L-1 of colistin when used as a commercial formulation and 67.0 mg L-1 when used as raw colistin sulfate. For nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, even the highest colistin concentration used in the assays (316 mg L-1) was not sufficient to inhibit the process. According to these results, the colistin concentrations expected in animal farming wastewater, when its dosage is used as a growth promoter, would not be enough to keep nitrification from taking place. Nevertheless, when used in higher concentrations, such as for therapeutic purposes, it could endanger the maintenance of the process.

AB Potential exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the aquatic environment is a subject of ongoing concern. We recently published maximum likely exposure rates for several hundred human prescription pharmaceuticals commonly used in the US. These rates were estimated from nationally aggregated marketing data and wastewater production rates. The accuracy of these estimates is unclear, and it is unclear how to use the national-level estimates of exposure to predict local exposure rates. In this study we compare our previous predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), which were based on marketing data, with PECs based on regulatory data. We then use local dispensing rates for 12 APIs along with local wastewater production rates to estimate the distribution of local PECs relative to national averages, in order to identify an 'application factor' suitable for converting national-level PECs into reliable bounds for local concentrations. We compare the national-level PECs and the proposed application factor with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) published in 62 recent peer-reviewed publications. Regulatory data-based national average PECs are uniformly lower than marketing data-based national average PECs, corroborating the intended conservative nature of the marketing data-based PECs. Variability in local API usage and wastewater production rates suggest local PECs may occasionally exceed national averages by about 10-fold. Multiplying national average PECs by an 'application factor' of 10 and comparing the resulting predicted maximum local PECs to published MEC data for 83 APIs corroborates the usefulness of 10-fold adjusted national PECs as a reasonable ceiling for measured environmental concentrations.

AB Concern is growing over contamination of the environment with pharmaceuticals because of their widespread use and incomplete removal during wastewater treatment, where microorganisms drive the key processes. The influence of pharmaceuticals on bacterial community structure in activated sludge was assessed in small-scale wastewater treatment bioreactors containing different concentrations (5, 50, 200 and 500 mu gL(-1)) of several commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, diclofenac and clofibric acid). T-RFLP analyses of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes indicated a minor but consistent shift in the bacterial community structure in the bioreactor R50 supplied with pharmaceuticals at a concentration of 50 pg L-1, compared to the control reactor RO, which was operated without addition of pharmaceuticals. In the reactors operated with higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals, a greater structural divergence was observed. Bacterial community composition was further investigated by preparation of two clone libraries of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from reactors RO and R50. Most clones in both libraries belonged to the Betaproteo-bacteria, among which Thauera, Sphaerotilus, Ideonella and Acidovorax-related spp. dominated. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira sp., which are key organisms for the second stage of nitrification in wastewater treatment plants, were found only in the clone library of the reactor without pharmaceuticals. In addition, diversity indices were calculated for the two clone libraries, indicating a reduced diversity of activated sludge bacterial community in the reactor supplied with 50 mu g L-1 of each of selected pharmaceuticals.

AB Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are producing a wide variety of antibiotics for human and veterinary use. Consequently, the water discharged from those facilities can contain residues of antibiotics, which could have adverse impact on the environment. However, studies on the occurrence of antibiotics in the wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers in Vietnam are almost non-existent. In this study, water samples were collected at around the outlets of four pharmaceutical manufacturing plants as well as from a hospital and an aquaculture farm around Hanoi in 2016 and 2017. Fifteen antibiotics from four major classes (beta-lactam, quinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides) were monitored, using a validated LC-MS/MS method, based on their number of registrations at the Ministry of Health. Ten antibiotics, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were detected in the samples at different concentrations. Notably, sulfonamides and quinolones were occasionally detected at very high concentration, such as sulfamethoxazole (252 mu g/L), trimethoprim (107 mu g/L), ofloxacin (85 mu g/L), and ciprofloxacin (41 mu g/L). In this study, concentrations of antibiotic residues in effluent of pharmaceutical plants were higher than those from other sources. The antibiotic-resistance tests indicated the widespread resistance to common antibiotics like quinolone and sulfonamides in the collected samples. This finding suggests that wastewater from pharmaceutical manufacturers could be an important source of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment of Vietnam.

AB In this study the occurrence and the behavior of illicit drugs and their metabolites have been investigated for two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (namely, WWTP-1 and WWTP-2) located in Sicily (island of Italy). Samples were analyzed for methamphetamine, cocaine (COC), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methadone (METH), 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine (MDA); 3,4-methylenedioxy ethyl amphetamine (MDEA), 11-nor-9-carboxy-Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and Benzoylecgonine (BEG). The BEG, COC, MOR and THC-COOH were found at the highest concentration in both WWTPs. The Wastewater-based epidemiology calculation for BEG, COC, cannabinoids and THC-COOH was performed. On average, for both plants, population consumes 1.6 and 23.4 dose 1000 inh(-1) day(-1) of cocaine and cannabis, respectively. For WWTP-1 negative removals of illicit drugs were observed. For WWTP-2 the following average removal efficiencies were obtained: BEG (77.85%), COC (92.34%), CODEINE (64.75%), MOR (90.16%) and THC-COOH (68.64%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cytostatic drugs, mainly used as chemotherapy compounds, can pose serious threats to aqueous ecosystem and human health once released into the natural environment. We investigated the use of an anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) for removing cytostatic drugs from wastewater. The AnOMBR utilizes a dense forward osmosis (FO) membrane in an anaerobic digester with prolonged sludge retention time (60 days). The high rejection of the FO membrane combined with the extended organic retention time in the reactor ensured high removal rates (more than 95.6%) for all the eight cytostatic drugs investigated. With regard to their removal routes in the AnOMBR, the eight cytostatic drugs can be divided into several groups. Doxorubicin, Epirubicin and Tamoxifen were nearly completely removed through the adsorption of anaerobic sludge, while Methotrexate and Cyclophosphamide were mainly removed by biodegradation and FO rejection, respectively. In addition, Mitotane, Azathioprine and Flutamide were removed by both biodegradation and adsorption. This work provides critical insights into the removal mechanisms of high-retention AnOMBRs.

AB A comprehensive study of various psychoactive substances and their metabolites was performed in the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Zagreb (780 000 inhabitants) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The estimation of drug abuse for five different illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine, marijuana, amphetamine and ecstasy, was made on the basis of their representative excretion rates, which were determined over a period of 8 months. Marijuana (1000 kg/year), heroin (75 kg/year) and cocaine (47 kg/year) were found to be the most frequently consumed illicit drugs, while the consumption of amphetamine-type drugs was much lower (1-3 kg/year). A comparison with other reports indicated that drug abuse profiles in transition countries might be different from those reported for Western Europe, in particular with respect to the comparatively increased consumption of heroin. Enhanced consumption of stimulating drugs (cocaine and ectasy) was systematically detected during weekends. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have developed as ecotoxicologically relevant micropollutants in the aquatic environment. During conventional biological wastewater treatment they are eliminated insufficiently and therefore reach surface waters via discharges. They are either partially or completely non-biodegradable and/or hardly eliminable by activated sludge adsorption because they often have polar structures. Membrane bioreactor treatment (MBR) was applied to pre-treat wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds, e.g., antibiotics like floxacins and their synthetic precursor compounds. Our objectives were to eliminate these persistent target compounds from wastewater prior to discharge into receiving waters. Therefore an advanced treatment applying MBR combined with different chemical and physicochemical processes was performed. The addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC), nano filtration (NF), reverse osmosis (UO) or ozone (O-3) and O-3/UV were applied to MBR permeate spiked with the selected target compounds. Treatment efficiency was assessed using conventional inorganic and organic chemical analyses besides advanced physicochernical methods like liquid chromatography coupled with mass and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS and -MS-MS).

TI Life Cycle and Economic Analyses of the Removal of Pesticides and

DE pesticides; pharmaceutical compounds; municipal wastewater; anodic
   oxidation; life cycle assessment; economic analysis
AB Several pesticides and pharmaceuticals (PP) have been detected in the effluent of a full-scale Portuguese Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Their presence contributed to the environmental burdens associated with the existing treatment of the Municipal Wastewater (MWW) in the impact categories of Human Carcinogenicity, Non-Carcinogenicity, and Freshwater toxicities on average by 85%, 60%, and 90%, respectively (ReciPe2016 and USEtox methods). The environmental and economic assessment of the installation of an Anodic Oxidation (AO) unit for PPs' removal was performed through Life Cycle and Economic Analysis, considering two types of anodes, the Boron-Doped Diamond (BDD) and the Mixed Metal Oxides (MMO). The operation of the AO unit increased the environmental burdens of the system by 95% on average (USEtox), but these impacts can be partially compensated by the avoided the production of non-renewable energy in the Portuguese electricity mix by biogas cogeneration at the WWTP. If the construction of the AO unit and the manufacturing of the electrodes are considered, the Human and Freshwater Toxicities are often higher than the environmental benefits derived from the PPs' removal. On the economic side, the MMO configuration is clearly more advantageous, whereas BDD is environmentally more favorable. The issue of the presence of PP in MWW effluents has to be addressed as an integrated solution both improving upstream PP's management and adopting PP's removal technologies strongly supported by renewable energies. Further insights are needed for the assessment of fate and of the environmental effects of PP in the sludge.

AB Human consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is increasing, which poses a great risk of pollution by these pharmaceuticals on the aquatic environment. Therefore, this study reports the optimization of microwave-assisted extraction using water as a green solvent and hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) methods followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis of NSAIDs in wastewater and aquatic plant,Eichhornia crassipes. The optimized MAE resulted in efficient transfer of selected NSAIDs from plant samples into the aqueous phase yielding the recoveries ranging from 91 to115%. A multivariate approach based on half fractional factorial and central composite design was used during the optimization of HF-LPME. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum enrichment factors for naproxen, fenoprofen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen were 49, 126, 93 and 156, respectively. The overall analytical method recoveries ranged from 86 to 116% while the limits of quantitation for wastewater and plant samples ranged from 0.09 to 0.59 mu g L(-1)and from 0.11 to 0.59 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The precision of the proposed analytical method which was measured in terms of RSD values did not exceed 5%. Naproxen was the most abundant compound in both wastewater and theEichhornia crassipesplant samples with concentrations of up to 3.30 mu g L(-1)and 10.97 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The detection of NSAIDs inEichhornia crassipesmeans this plant has the ability to bioaccumulate pharmaceutical load in surface water.

AB BACKGROUND: Emerging organic contaminants include a large group of compounds that are frequently detected in wastewater along with heavy metals, due to incomplete removal or limitations in conventional and advanced treatment processes. In this work, the efficiency of Juncus acutus L. on the removal of mixed contamination; ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), bisphenol A (BPA) and heavy metals (chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn)), was investigated in a hydroponic experiment in order to evaluate its potential for use in the alternative remediation technology of constructed wetland (CW) systems. Concentrations of the compounds ranged from mu g L-1 to well beyond environmentally relevant values (50 mg L-1 for the organics and more than 1000 mg L-1 in the case of Zn and Cr).
   RESULTS: Antibiotics (CIP and SMX), BPA and heavy metals were efficiently removed after 28 days, without J. acutus exhibiting perceptible phytotoxicity symptoms, in concentrations even higher than those that are generally detected in industrial or hospital wastewater. Extremely high concentrations of heavymetals induced severe physiological damage to the plants.
   CONCLUSION: The remarkable efficiency of the halophyte J. acutus was revealed, regarding all the contaminants tested at environmentally relevant concentrations. In higher concentrations of antibiotics and mixtures of organic and inorganic contaminants, the contribution of the plant was also demonstrated. Findings from this work suggest that J. acutus plants are an ideal candidate for phytoremediation applications in CW systems, targeting urban, industrial or pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB Wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) closures are rare environmental remediation events; offering unique insight into contaminant persistence, long-term wastewater impacts, and ecosystem recovery processes. The U.S. Geological Survey assessed the fate of select endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in surface water and streambed sediment one year before and one year after closure of a long-term WWTF located within the Spirit Creek watershed at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Sample sites included a WWTF-effluent control located upstream from the outfall, three downstream effluent-impacted sites located between the outfall and Spirit Lake, and one downstream from the lake's outfall. Prior to closure, the 2.2-km stream segment downstream from the WWTF outfall was characterized by EDC concentrations significantly higher (alpha = 0.05) than at the control site; indicating substantial downstream transport and limited in-stream attenuation of EDC, including pharmaceuticals, estrogens, alkylphenol ethoxylate (APE) metabolites, and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFR). Wastewater-derived pharmaceutical, APE metabolites, and OPFR compounds were also detected in the outflow of Spirit Lake, indicating the potential for EDC transport to aquatic ecosystems downstream of Fort Gordon under effluent discharge conditions. After the WWTF closure, no significant differences in concentrations or numbers of detected EDC compounds were observed between control and downstream locations. The results indicated EDC pseudo-persistence under preclosure, continuous supply conditions, with rapid attenuation following WWTF closure. Low concentrations of EDC at the control site throughout the study and comparable concentrations in downstream locations after WWTF closure indicated additional, continuing, upstream contaminant sources within the Spirit Creek watershed.

AB Nanoscale photocatalysts have attracted much attention due to their high surface area to volume ratios. However, due to extremely high reactivity, TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared using different methods tend to either react with surrounding media or agglomerate, resulting in the formation of much larger flocs and significant loss in reactivity. This work investigates the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), a persistent pharmaceutical compound from wastewater (WW) using TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared in the presence of a water-soluble whey powder as stabilizer. The TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles prepared in the presence of whey stabilizer displayed much less agglomeration and greater degradation power than those prepared without a stabilizer. Higher photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine was observed (100%) by using whey stabilized TiO2 nanoparticles with 55 min irradiation time as compared to ZnO nanoparticles (92%). The higher degradation of CBZ in wastewater by using TiO2 nanoparticles as compared to ZnO nanoparticles was due to formation of higher photo-generated holes with high oxidizing power of TiO2. The photocatalytic capacity of ZnO anticipated as similar to that of TiO2 as it has the same band gap energy (3.2 eV) as TiO2. However, in the case of ZnO, photocorrosion frequently occurs with the illumination of UV light and this phenomenon is considered as one of the main reasons for the decrease of ZnO photocatalytic activity in aqueous solutions. Further, the estrogenic activity of photocatalyzed WW sample with CBZ and its by-products was carried out by yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay method. Based upon the YES test results, none of the samples showed estrogenic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This paper describes the susceptibility evaluation of Escherichia coli, isolated from the influent and effluent of the biological reactors in two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP1 and WWTP2), and the evaluation of the disinfection efficiency of the UV radiation system in WWTP2.
   The exposure to different families of antibiotics was evaluated, namely, macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), nitroimidazoles (metronidazole), sulfanilamides (sulfamethoxazole) and trimethoprim, the latter is used in combination with sulfamethoxazole due to its synergistic effect.
   The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility tests, using disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method, showed the occurrence of E. coli strains resistance. The analysis performed indicated an overall resistance (considering both influents and effluents) in WWTP1 and WWTP2, of respectively: 33.3% and 37.5% to erythromycin; 0.0% and 4.0% to azithromycin; 25.0% and 29.2% to clarithromycin; 12.5% and 4.2% to ofloxacin; 16.7% and 4.2% to ciprofloxacin; 29.2% and 12.5% to trimethoprim; 41.7% and 12.5% to sulfamethoxazole. A variability of resistance was observed along the studied period, from WWTP1 and WWTP2, and from influent to effluent.
   Disinfection by UV demonstrated good performance, achieving in some samples 100% removal of E. coli that has growth in TBX agar. However, a proper supervision is needed in order to achieve the allowed limits concerning the number of bacteria.
   The results from this work contribute to a better awareness of ARB dissemination from wastewater treatment plants to the aquatic environment.

AB BACKGROUND The performance of a biological aerated filter (BAF) with activated sludge and nut shell activated carbon was evaluated for the advanced treatment of intractable refinery wastewater. Bioaugmenting the BAF with Pseudomonas sp. FS-01 and Bacillus sp. FS-02 and the microbial community structure between the upgrade system and the original system were also studied. RESULTS During the steady state of the BAF, the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was in the range 80-128 mg L-1, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) was in the range 15-20 mg L-1. The BAF with activated carbon from nut shells as a supporting material can remove over 32% of influent COD and 95% of NH4+-N. On bioaugmentation, the average effluent COD and NH4+-N concentrations were 31.8 and 0.4 mg L-1, respectively. The predominant genera in BAF1 were Nitrospira, an unranked member of the Anaerolineaceae and an unclassified member of the Rhizobiales, while the dominant genera in BAF2 were Pseudomonas, Bacillus and an unranked member of the Anaerolineaceae. CONCLUSIONS The coconut shell activated carbon has outstanding properties for removing COD and NH4+-N, along with high shock loading resistance. Bioaugmentation can improve the COD remove efficiency by 35% in relation to only adding sludge. Microbial diversity analysis indicated that bioaugmentation accelerated the transformation of the bacterial community structure, quickly becoming dominant strains. This bioaugmented process may be a promising alternative technology for the treatment of refractory wastewater. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In this work, the implementation and competitiveness of a continuous coupled wet oxidation/biological process for the treatment of four different phenolic compounds of a pharmaceutical wastewater are evaluated according to removal efficiency of each compound, sensitivity to feed perturbations and robustness.
   Efficiencies of wet oxidation pretreatment for each compound rose to 95%, whereas an important part of the initial COD remained in the medium. In the case of the biotreatment, phenolic compounds were practically eliminated and COD reductions up to 95% were achieved. These values are higher than those obtained by means of the majority of the coupled processes.
   The wet oxidation also showed relatively low sensitivities in front of perturbations on the feed composition for compounds with kinetic constants during the wet oxidation process higher than 8.4 h(-1). Sensitivity studies indicated that the system is stable to changes in the flow rate for residence times in the bioreactor lower than 25 days. Perturbations of the oxygen flow rate had no effect on the removal of the phenolic compounds, in accordance with the fact of calculated Hatta numbers lower than 0.015, indicating a kinetically controlled regime in the range assayed (4-10 kgO(2)/m(wastewater)(3)).
   Additionally, during the evaluation of the robustness of the process, "dampening factors" near of 1 were obtained for the removal of phenolic compounds, corroborating the excellent behavior of the coupled wet oxidation/biological system when fast and continuous changes in the pollutant load were assayed.

TI Performance Evaluation of Porous Graphene as Filter Media for the

AB Graphene and its counterparts have been widely used for the removal of contaminants from (waste)water but with limited success for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants. Driven by this need, this study reports, for the first time, the removal of pharmaceuticals from real contaminated water samples using porous graphene (PG) as a filter-based column. This work systematically evaluates the performance of PG as a filter medium for the removal of widely consumed pharmaceutical/emerging contaminants (ECs) such as atenolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. Several factors were investigated in these column studies, including different reactive layer configurations, bed packing heights (5-45 mm), filter sizes (inner diameter 18-40 mm), adsorbent dosages (100-500 mg-PG) and water bodies (distilled water, greywater, and actual effluent wastewater). Sustainable synthesis of PG was carried out followed by its use as a filter medium for the removal of pharmaceuticals at high concentrations (10.5 +/- 0.5 mg/L) and trace concentrations (1 mg/L). These findings revealed that the double-layered PG-sand column outperformed a PG single-layered configuration for the removal of most of the ECs. The removal efficiency of ECs from their solutions was improved by increasing PG dosages and filter bed height and size. Although the treatment of mixed pharmaceutical solutions from different water bodies was affected by the negative interference caused by competing water compounds, the treatment of ECs-contaminated greywater was not severely affected. Our findings suggest that PG, as a highly efficient filter medium, could be used for the removal of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants from water and wastewater.

AB In this study, gadolinium doped bismuth vanadate powders were synthesized, characterized, and tested as a potential photocatalyst for the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and bacterial inactivation in a real wastewater effluent using UVA as irradiation source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies revealed that the bismuth vanadate system was successfully doped with 4% of gadolinium in molar mass leading to the formation of a heterostructured photocatalyst. Up to 98.3 % of diclofenac was removed from pure water after 120 min through photocatalysis.
   However, the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst on wastewater effluent was rather variable due to the complexity of the matrix where 22 different PhACs were detected by means of Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). High photocatalytic removal efficiency (80-100%) was observed for some of the studied PhACs (e.g. naproxen and furosemide) whereas moderate efficiency (40-70%) was observed for others (e.g. acetaminophen and azithromycin) after 180 min (UVA dose = 139.5 Wh m(-2), t(30W) = 279 min(-1)). Some of the studied PhACs like clarithromycin and Ibuprofen showed poor removal efficiency (< 30 %). In disinfection tests, Total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed inactivation after direct UVA LED photolysis. Nevertheless, higher inactivation was achieved for Enterococci in the presence of the synthesized photocatalyst showing an increase of 41.1 % in k(max).

AB This paper deals with the photolytic and the photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMT) dissolved in Milli-Q water and in synthetic wastewater. Besides the direct photolysis, oxidation processes including UV/H2O2, UV/TiO2, and UV/TiO2/H2O2 using UV-A and UV-C radiation were investigated. Pseudo-first-order kinetics was observed for the degradation of SMT in all investigated processes. Additions of an electron acceptor (H2O2) and a catalyst (TiO2 film) accelerated the photolytic degradation of SMT for both the UV-A- and the UV-C-based processes. The most efficient process was UV-C/TiO2/H2O2 with complete degradation of SMT obtained in 10 min. The UV-A-based processes have been less efficient in terms of irradiation time required to totally degrade SMT than the UV-C-based processes. It was also confirmed that different wastewater components can significantly reduce the degradation rate of SMT. An almost ninefold reduction in the rate constant of SMT was observed for the specific synthetic wastewater. Although UV-A radiation experiments need more time and energy (2.7 times more electrical energy was consumed per gram of demineralized SMT) than UV-C experiments, they have a potential for practical use since natural UV-A solar radiation could be used here, which lowers the overall cost of the treatment. Five degradation products were detected during the degradation processes, and their structural formulae are presented. The structural formulae were elucidated based on mass spectra fragmentation pattern obtained using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and NMR analysis.

AB Global population growth induces increased threat on drinking water resources. One way to address this environmental issue is to reuse water from wastewater treatment plant. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms and potentially toxic organic micropollutants does not allow a direct reuse of urban effluents. Membrane processes such reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) can be considered to effectively eliminate these pollutants. The integration of membrane processes involves the production of concentrated retentates which require being disposed. To date, no treatment is set up to manage safely this pollution. This work focuses on the application of ozonation for the treatment of NF retentates in the framework of the wastewater reuse. Ozonation is a powerful oxidation process able to react and degrade a wide range of organic pollutants. Four pharmaceutical micropollutants were selected as target molecules: acetaminophen, carbamazepine, atenolol and diatrozic acid. This study highlighted that NF represents a viable alternative to the commonly used RO process ensuring high retention at much lower operating costs. Ozonation appears to be effective to degrade the most reactive pollutants toward molecular ozone but is limited for the reduction of refractory ozone pollutants due to the inhibition of the radical chain by the high content of organic matter in the retentates. The ozonation process appears to be a promising NF retentate treatment, but additional treatments after ozonation are required to lead to a zero liquid discharge treatment scheme.

AB The viability of treating high-concentration antibiotic wastewater by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was studied using submerged flat sheet membrane. The major problems for these modules are concentration polarization and subsequent fouling. By using gas-liquid two-phase flow, these problems can be ameliorated. A case study has been identified and the current issues in one of the major pharmaceutical industry (manufacturing cephalosporin drugs) located in Chennai, India, has been discussed for the possible removal of anaerobically transformed intermediates of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time on the removal of cephalosporin derivative, viz., cephalexin (C16H17N3O4S center dot H2O) and the intermediates [7-amino-3-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and acyl group (Phenyl acetic acid)] in the MBR with enhanced biodegradation using bioaugmentation technique. Based on the critical examination of results, the industry is looking for the alternatives of either direct disposal of 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid or for further degradation and disposal, which will essentially require additional cost and maintenance. The present regulatory standard implemented at a global level, (meaning the intermediates which are transformed during its course of travel within the industry and in the treatments plants, i.e., in the present study it is, 7-ADCA and phenyl acetic acid are not allowed to discharge on water bodies), does not envisage such disposal alternatives and hence the present study was aimed at the complete removal of intermediates (7-ADCA) and phenyl acetic acid prior to discharge.

AB The potential of a lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) to remove polar pollutants from municipal wastewater was studied for industrial and household chemicals over a period of 22 months parallel to a conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment. For half of the compounds, such as benzotriazole, 5-tolyltriazole (5-TTri), benzothiazole-2-sulfonate and 1,6-naphthalene disulfonate (1,6-NDSA), removal by MBR was significantly better than in CAS, while no improvement was recorded for the other half (1,5-NDSA, 1,3-NDSA, 4-TTri and naphthalene-1-sulfonate). The influence of operational conditions on trace pollutant removal by MBR was studied but no significant effects were found for variation of hydraulic retention time (7 h-14 h) and sludge retention time (26 d-102 d), suggesting that the lowest values selected have already been high enough for good removal. It is shown that the seemingly inconsistent results reported here and in previous studies regarding the comparison of trace pollutant removal in MBR and CAS are highly consistent. MBR is neither superior for well degradable compounds that are already extensively degraded in CAS treatment nor for recalcitrant compounds that are not amenable to biodegradation. For most compounds of intermediate removal in CAS treatment (15-80%), among them pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals, the MBR is clearly superior and reduces the effluent concentration by 20-50%. Despite of this clear benefit of MBR, the effect is not pronounced enough to serve as a sole argument for employing MBR in municipal wastewater treatment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Membrane technology is one of the most promising technologies for wastewater remedy. However, it remains challenging to prepare high-performance membrane matrix for complex pollutants, e.g. containing both oil and organic dye. In this work, we facilely fabricate a cellulose-fiber-supported MOF photocatalytic membrane, namely Ag@AgCl@MIL-100(Fe)/CCF, which was prepared via carboxymethylation of cotton fabric (CCF) as scaffold and in-situ synthesis of MOF derivative as photocatalyst. The carboxymethylation significantly improves the hydrophilicity of cotton fabric and the deposition amount of MIL-100(Fe). The high hydrophilicity of modified CCF and porous MIL-100(Fe) further enable the membrane with an efficient adsorption capacity of dyes and underwater oleophobicity against oils. The photocatalysts Ag@AgCl nanoparticles anchored onto MIL-100(Fe) promote the photocatalytic activity. As a result, the membrane shows simultaneous high removal efficiency towards dyes (97.3 %) and oils (99.64 %). Additionally, thanks to the good photocatalytic activity against organic pollutants, the membrane exhibits excellent self-cleaning and a long-term reuse capacity.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical pollutants, including antibiotic contaminants in the environment is one of the most important issues in the world today. We focused on elimination of amoxicillin (AMX) from aqueous media in micro Channel Y-Y shaped. The kinetic studies showed that the reaction kinetic was very fast and extraction equilibrium is attained within 20 s. Key operational parameters such as feed concentration, pH of aqueous solution, and extractant concentration and residence time were optimized. The maximum rate of AMX removal was determined 98.2%. Overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient of amoxicillin k(L)alpha, is perused to specify the mass transfer performance. Much higher amoxicillin k(L)alpha values acquired in the micro process compare with conventional extraction approved the amoxicillin is easily extracted with a higher ratio at micro-flow. The studies demonstrated that the micro solvent extraction process has considerable potential for environmentally friendly and would be a promising method for wastewater treatment of complex systems.

AB To test the toxicity of ketoprofen (a commonly-used NSAIDs) using two microalgal strains and Artemia sp. following the isolation of bacterial and microalgal strains and testing their ability to biodegrade and tolerate ketoprofen.
   Chlorella sp. was the most resistant to ketoprofen. A defined bacterial consortium (K-2) degraded 5 mM ketoprofen as a sole carbon source both in the dark or continuous illumination. Ketoprofen did not undergo photodegradation. In the dark, biodegradation was faster with a lag phase of 10 h, 41% COD removal and 82 % reduction in toxicity. The consortium degraded up to 16 mM ketoprofen. The consortium was composed of four bacterial isolates that were identified. MS/MS analysis suggested a ketoprofen biodegradation pathway that has not been previously reported. Combining Chlorella sp. and the K-2 consortium, ketoprofen was degraded within 7 days under a diurnal cycle of 12 h light/12 h dark.
   The feasibility of using a microalgal-bacterial system to treat pharmaceutical wastewater is promising for the reduction of the process cost and providing a safer technology for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater by activated sludge (AS) and constructed wetlands (CWs). This analysis was carried out in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of a rural community where they implemented two technologies in parallel: AS and a pilot plant of horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands. In this case, these systems were fed by the same influent and the removal efficiencies of 14 OMPs, including analgesics/anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, stimulants, antifungals, fragrances, plasticizers, and transformation products, were evaluated in each system. Regarding the presence of OMPs in the wastewater, the concentrations of these compounds in the influent ranged from 0.16 to 7.75 mu g/L. In general, the removal efficiencies achieved by the AS system were between 10%-95% higher than those values reported by HSSFs with values above 80% for naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, caffeine, triclosan, methyl dihydrojasmonate, bisphenol-A, 2-hydroxyl ibuprofen, and carboxy ibuprofen (p < 0.05). This behavior can be related to the aerobic conditions that promote the AS system with oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values above -281 mV and 0.24 mg/L, respectively. However, the removal of galaxolide was greater in HSSF system than in AS with significant difference of 70% (p < 0.05). Despite these results, this study reveals that comparing both technologies, AS had the best removal performance of these OMPs studied.

AB In this work, a granular activated carbon (GAC) was produced using primary paper mill sludge (PS) as raw material and ammonium lignosulfonate (AL) as binder agent. PS is a residue from the pulp and paper industry and AL is a by-product of the cellulose pulp manufacture and the proposed production scheme contributes for their valorisation together with important savings in GAC precursors. The produced GAC (named PSA-PA) and a commercially available GAC (GACN), used as referencematerial, were physically and chemically characterized. Then, these materials were tested in batch experiments for the adsorption of carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and paroxetine (PAR) from ultra-pure water and wastewater. Even though GACN and PSA-PA possess very similar specific surface areas (S-BET) (629 and 671 m(2) g(-1), respectively), PSA-PA displayed lowermaximum adsorption capacities (qm) than GACN for the pharmaceuticals here studied (6 +/- 1-44 +/- 5 mg g(-1) and 49 +/- 6-106 +/- 40 mg g(-1), respectively). This may be related to the comparatively higher incidence of mesopores in GACN, which might have positively influenced its adsorptive performance. Moreover, the highest hydrophobic character and degree of aromaticity of GACN could also have contributed to its adsorption capacity. On the other hand, the performance of both GACs was significantly affected by the matrix in the case of CBZ and SMX, with lower qm in wastewater than in ultra-pure water. However, the adsorption of PAR was not affected by thematrix. Electrostatic interactions and pH effectsmight also have influenced the adsorption of the pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater.

AB Pharmaceutical residues are ubiquitous in rivers, lakes, and at coastal waters affected by discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the presence of 17 different pharmaceuticals and six different phase I metabolites was determined in the bile of two wild fish species, bream (Abramis brama) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). The fish were caught from a lake that receives treated municipal wastewater via a small river. Prior to analyses, the bile content was enzymatically hydrolyzed to convert the glucuronide metabolites into the original pharmaceuticals or phase I metabolites. The solid phase extracts of hydrolyzates were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The anti-inflammatory drug naproxen could be detected in all the six bream and roach bile samples. Diclofenac was found in five of the bream and roach samples, while ibuprofen was detected in three bream and two roach samples. The observed bile concentrations of diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen in bream ranged from 6 to 95 ng mL(-1), 6 to 32 ng mL(-1), and 16 to 34 ng mL(-1), respectively. The corresponding values in roach samples ranged from 44 to 148 ng mL(-1), 11 to 103 ng mL(-1) and 15 to 26 ng mL(-1), respectively. None of the other studied compounds could be detected. The study shows that pharmaceuticals originating from wastewater treatment plant effluents can be traced to the bile of wild bream and roach living in a lake where diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen are present as pollutants.

AB The current study evaluated the removal of six micropollutants (estrone (E1); 17 beta-estradiol (E2); 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2); ibuprofen (IBP), diclofenac (DCF), and paracetamol (PCT)) from the final effluent of an activated sludge domestic sewage treatment plant using polishing filters. Four polishing filters were assembled as columns and filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite, sand and charcoal, sand and granulated activated carbon (9:1 by volume), and sand only. The column filters were placed near the outlet of a full-scale activated sludge treatment plant and were fed with a treated effluent containing from 4.71 to 28.93 ng L-1 of the target compounds at a hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 50 m(3) m(-2) day(-1). Samples were collected periodically from the influent (biologically treated sewage) and effluent of the four columns and analyzed for estrogens, anti-inflammatories, and analgesic compounds. Liquid samples were submitted to a solid phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry after their derivatization. Among the compounds found, diclofenac was distinguished by the high occurrence of detection in the samples (85%) and higher mean concentration ( 17 ng L-1). High removal efficiency (> 90%) of the estrogens was observed in the polishing systems studied, while for the other targets, the removal efficiency varied from 10 to 30%. The concentration values of some compounds were low, probably due to rainfall during the sampling period.

AB Groundwater treatment sludge is a type of solid waste with 9.0-28.9% wt.% Fe content and is precipitated in large quantity from backwash wastewater in groundwater treatment. The sludge is mainly composed of fine particles containing Fe, Si and Al oxides, such as ferrihydrite, quartz and boehmite. The Fe oxides mostly originate from the oxidation of ferrous Fe in groundwater, whilst the silicate/aluminium compounds mainly originate from the broken quartz sand filter in the backwash step. In general, the sludge is firstly coagulated, dewatered by filter pressing and finally undergoes harmless solidification before it is sent to landfills. However, this process is costly (approximately US$66.1/t) and complicated. In this study, groundwater treatment sludge was effectively recycled to prepare novel erdite-bearing particles via a one-step hydrothermal method by adding only Na2S.9H(2)O. After hydrothermal treatment, the quartz and boehmite of the sludge were dissolved and recrystallised to sodalite, whilst ferrihydrite was converted to an erdite nanorod at 160 degrees C and a hematite at 240 degrees C. SP160 was prepared as fine nanorod particles with 200 nm diameter and 2-5 mu m length at a hydrothermal temperature of 160 degrees C. Nearly 100% OTC and its derivatives in pharmaceutical manufacture wastewater were removed by adding 0.1 g SP160. The major mechanism for the removal was the spontaneous hydrolysis of erdite in SP160 to generate Fe oxyhydroxide and use many hydroxyl groups for coordinating OTC and its derivatives. This study presents a novel method for the resource reutilisation of waste groundwater treatment sludge and reports efficient erdite-bearing particles for pharmaceutical manufacture wastewater treatment.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) arc frequently detected in water and wastewater, and have attracted wide attention due to potential adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. In this work, manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge (Mn-AGS) was successfully cultivated and applied to remove OMPs from wastewater. Biogenic manganese (III,IV) oxides (bio-MnOx) were generated and accumulated to 22.0-28.3 mg Mn/g SS in the final sludge. Neither the addition of allochthonous manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB; Pseudomonas putida MnB1) nor the reduction in hydraulic retention time (HRT) facilitated the cultivation of Mn-AGS. Batch experiments of OMPs degradation indicated that Mn-AGS significantly improved (1.3-3.9 times) degradation rates of most OMPs. Removal rates of bisphenol A (BPA), 17 alpha ethinylestradiol (EE2), tetracycline (TC), and chloramphenicol (CAP) were 3.0-12.6 mu g/h/g SS by the traditional AGS and 8.0-16.3 mu g/h/g SS by Mn-AGS; those of imazethapyr (IM) were relatively high, 64.7 +/- 0.1 and 127.8 +/- 25 mu g/h/g SS by AGS and Mn-AGS, respectively. However, degradation of dichlorophenyl phosphine (DCPP) was slower by Mn-AGS than AGS, 9.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 21.2 +/- 0.9 mu g/h/g SS, possibly due to inhibition of microbial activity by bio-MnOx. This work provides a promising method for treating OMPs in organic wastewater, but the possible inhibition of microbes by bio-MnOx should be noted. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental sustainability of a semi-industrial solar photo-Fenton reactor, treating real effluents emanating from a pharmaceutical laboratory, is assessed herein. The life cycle assessment/analysis (LCA) methodology was employed and real life cycle inventory (LCI) data was collected from a ferrioxalate-assisted homogeneous solar photo-Fenton wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), at Ciudad Real, Spain. Electricity was provided by photovoltaic (PV) panels in tandem with a battery bank, making the plant autonomous from the local grid. The effective treatment of 1 m(3) of secondary-treated pharmaceutical wastewater, containing antipyrine, was used as a functional unit. The main environmental hotspot was identified to be the chemical reagents used to enhance treatment efficiency, mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to a smaller degree oxalic acid. On the other hand, land use, PV panels, battery units, compound parabolic collectors (CPC), tanks, pipes and pumps, as materials, had a low contribution, ranging from as little as 0.06% up to about 2% on the total CO2eq emissions. Overall, the solar photo-Fenton process was found to be a sustainable technology for treating wastewater containing micropollutants at semi-industrial level, since the total environmental footprint was found to be 2.71 kgCO(2) m(-3) or 272 mPt m(-3), using IPCC 2013 and ReCiPe impact assessment methods, respectively. A sensitivity analysis revealed that if the excess of solar power is fed back into the grid then the total environmental footprint is reduced. Depending on the amount of solar power fed back into the grid the process could have a near zero total environmental footprint. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to concerns regarding the release of pharmaceuticals into the environment and the understudied impact of stereochemistry of pharmaceuticals on their fate and biological potency, we focussed in this paper on stereoselective transformation pathways of selected chiral pharmaceuticals (16 pairs) at both microcosm (receiving waters and activated sludge wastewater treatment simulating microcosms) and macrocosm (wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) utilising activated sludge technology and receiving waters) scales in order to test the hypothesis that biodegradation of chiral drugs is stereoselective. Our monitoring programme of a full scale activated sludge WWTP and receiving environment revealed that several chiral drugs, those being marketed mostly as racemates, are present in wastewater and receiving waters enriched with one enantiomeric form (e.g. fluoxetine, mirtazapine, salbutamol, MDMA). This is most likely due to biological metabolic processes occurring in humans and other organisms. Both activated sludge and receiving waters simulating microcosms confirmed our hypothesis that chiral drugs are subject to stereoselective microbial degradation. It led, in this research, to preferential degradation of S-(+)-enantiomers of amphetamines, R-(+)-enantiomers of beta-blockers and S-(+)-enantiomers of antidepressants. In the case of three parent compound metabolite pairs (venlafaxine desmethylvenlafaxine, citalopram desmethylcitalopram and MDMA - MDA), while parent compounds showed higher resistance to both microbial metabolism and photodegradation, their desmethyl metabolites showed much higher degradation rate both in terms of stereoselective metabolic and non-stereoselective photochemical processes. It is also worth noting that metabolites tend to be, as expected, enriched with enantiomers of opposite configuration to their parent compounds, which might have significant toxicological consequences when evaluating the metabolic residues of chiral pollutants.

AB While environmental risk assessment is typically based on toxicant concentrations in water and/or sediment, awareness is increasing that internal concentrations or body burdens are the key to understand adverse effects in organisms. In order to link environmental micropollutants as causes of observed effects, there is an increasing demand for methods to analyse these chemicals in organisms. Here, a multi-target screening method based on pulverised liquid extraction (PULE) and a modified QuEChERS approach with an additional hexane phase was developed. It is capable to extract and quantify organic micropollutants of diverse chemical classes in freshwater invertebrates. The method was tested on gammarids from the Danube River (within the Joint Danube Survey 3) and target compounds were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, a non-target screening using high resolution-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HAMS/MS) was conducted. A total of 17 pollutants were detected and/or quantified in gammarids at low concentrations. Pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 6.52 ng g(-1) (wet weight), those of wastewater-derived pollutants from 0.1 to 2.83 ng g(-1) (wet weight). The presence of wastewater-derived pollutants was prominent at all spots sampled. Using non-target screening, we could successfully identify several chlorinated compounds. These results demonstrate for the first time the presence of pesticides and wastewater-derived pollutants in invertebrates of the Danube River. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, concerns about the occurrence and fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients, solvents, intermediates and raw materials that could be present in pharmaceutical industry effluents have gained increasing attention. Conventional treatment methods, such as activated sludge, are not sufficient enough to remove active pharmaceutical ingredients completely. As a result, complementary treatment methods like coagulation and flocculation are often used and play a critical role in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. The primary goal of these methods is to destabilize and remove colloidal particles along with other organic/inorganic contaminants. Recently empirical works have considered ozone as the most promising oxidant for the removal of micro-pollutants. The current study examined the effectiveness of coagulation/flocculation process using ferric chloride, polyaluminum chloride, and aluminum sulfate as a reasonable approach to tackle the issue of treating pharmaceutical wastewater. In addition, the results were compared with the process using only ferric chloride that was the coagulant of an actual treatment plant. Then, improvement of the process performance was investigated using ozone as an oxidant. In conclusion, it was found out that polyaluminum chloride presented better performance among two other coagulants and also adding 200 mg/L of polyaluminum chloride can lead to 97-98 % turbidity removal efficiency. Moreover, polyaluminum chloride was capable of reducing most of the environmental parameters such as chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solid with the removal efficiency of 70 and 68 %, respectively. Additionally, ozonation improved the coagulation process, especially iron ion removal, and dramatically decreased the concentration from 5.68 to 0.19 mg/L.

AB A double membrane system comprising a membrane bioreactor (MBR) combined with a nanofiltration (NF) membrane was investigated on a pilot scale for the treatment of antibiotic production wastewater over a three-month period at a pharmaceutical company in Wuxi, China. By recycling the NF concentrate, the combined MBR-NF process was shown to be effective for the treatment of antibiotic production wastewater, resulting in excellent water quality and a high water yield of 92 +/- 5.6%. The water quality of the pilot-scale MBR-NF process was excellent; e.g., the concentrations of TOC, NH4+-N, TP were stable at 5.52, 0.68, 0.34 mg L-1, respectively, and the values of turbidity and conductivity of the NF permeate were 0.15 NTU and 2.5 mS cm(-1), respectively; these values meet China's water quality standard requirements for industrial use (GB21903-2008). Not only were the antibiotic removal rates of spiramycin (SPM) and new spiramycin (NSPM) over 95%, the acute toxicity was also drastically reduced by the MBR-NF pilot system. The main organics in the MBR effluent were proteins, polysaccharides, and humic-like substances; they were almost completely retained by the NF membrane and further biodegraded in the MBR because the NF concentrate was recycled. The microbial community of the MBR did not significantly change with the recycling of the NF concentrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bacterial strain Paracoccus denitrificans W12, which could utilize pyridine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was added into a membrane bioreactor (MBR) to enhance the treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater. The treatment efficiencies investigated showed that the removal of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were similar between bioaugmented and non-bioaugmented MBRs, however, significant removal of pyridine was obtained in the bioaugmented reactor. When the hydraulic retention time was 60 hr and the influent concentration of pyridine was 250-500 mg/L, the mean effluent concentration of pyridine without adding W12 was 57.2 mg/L, while the pyridine was degraded to an average of 10.2 mg/L with addition of W12. The bacterial community structure of activated sludge during the bioaugmented treatment was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The results showed that the W12 inoculum reversed the decline of microbial community diversity, however, the similarity between bacterial community structure of the original sludge and that of the sludge after bioaugmentation decreased steadily during the wastewater treatment. Sequencing of the DNA recovered from DGGE gel indicated that Flavobacteriaceae sp., Sphingobium sp., Comamonas sp., and Hyphomicrobium sp. were the dominant organisms in time sequence in the bacterial community in the bioaugmented MBR. This implied that the bioaugmentation was affected by the adjustment of whole bacterial community structure in the inhospitable environment, rather than being due solely to the degradation performance of the bacterium added.

AB This work investigates the application of the electro-oxidation technology provided with boron doped diamond (BDD), an electrode material which has shown outstanding properties in oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds, for the treatment of reverse osmosis (RO) concentrates generated in tertiary wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and several anions were measured during the electro-oxidation process, and the influence of the applied current density (20-200 A/m(2)) was analysed on process kinetics. Analytical assessment showed that several emerging pollutants (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, stimulants, etc.) were presented both in the effluent of the secondary WWTP as well as in the RO concentrate. For this reason, a group of 10 emerging pollutants, those found with higher concentrations, was selected in order to test whether electro-oxidation can be also applied for their mitigation. In the removal of emerging pollutants the electrical current density in the range 20-100 A/m(2) did not show influence likely due to the mass transfer resistance developed in the process when the oxidized solutes are present in such low concentrations. Their removal rates were fitted to first order expressions, and the apparent kinetic constants for the anodic oxidation of each compound were calculated. Finally, the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) has been checked; concluding that after selecting the appropriate operational conditions the attained concentration is lower than the standards for drinking water established in European and EPA regulations.

AB Residues of pharmaceuticals present in wastewater and sewage sludge are of concern due to their transfer to aquatic and terrestrial food chains and possible adverse effects on nontargeted organisms. In the present work, uptake and translocation of metformin, an antidiabetic II medicine, by edible plant species cultivated in agricultural soil have been investigated in greenhouse experiment. Metformin demonstrated a high uptake and translocation to oily seeds of rape (Brassica nap us cv. Sheik and Brassica rapa cv. Valo); expressed as an average bioconcentration factor (BCF, plant concentration over initial concentration in soil, both in dry weight), BCF values as high as 21.72 were measured. In comparison, BCFs for grains of the cereals wheat, barley, and oat were in the range of 0.29-1.35. Uptake and translocation to fruits and vegetables of tomato (BCFs 0.02-0.06), squash (BCFs 0.12-0.18), and bean (BCF 0.88) were also low compared to rape. BCFs for carrot, potato, and leaf forage B. napus cv. Sola were similar (BCF 1-4). Guanylurea, a known degradation product of metformin by microorganisms in activated sludge, was found in barley grains, bean pods, potato peel, and small potatoes. The mechanisms for transport of metformin and guanidine in plants are still unknown, whereas organic cation transporters (OCTs) in mammals are known to actively transport such compounds and may guide the way for further understanding of mechanisms also in plants.

AB This study explored the effect of different bulk organic carbon matrices on the fate of trace organic chemicals (TOrC) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR) infiltration through porous media was simulated in biologically active column experiments under aerobic and anoxic recharge conditions. Wastewater effluent derived organic carbon types, differing in hydrophobicity and biodegradability (i e, hydrophobic acids, hydrophilic carbon, organic colloids), were used as feed substrates in the column experiments. These carbon substrates while fed at the same concentration differed in their ability to support soil biomass growth during porous media infiltration Removal of degradable TOrC (with the exception of diclofenac and propyphenazone) was equal or better under aerobic versus anoxic porous media infiltration conditions During the initial phase of infiltration, the presence of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) enhanced the decay of degradable TOrC by promoting soil biomass growth, suggesting that BDOC served as a co-substrate in a co-metabolic transformation of these contaminants However, unexpected high removal efficiencies were observed for all degradable TOrC in the presence of low BDOC concentrations under well adopted oligotrophic conditions It is hypothesized that removal under these conditions is caused by a specialized microbial community growing on refractory carbon substrates such as hydrophobic acids Findings of this study reveal that the concentration and character of bulk organic carbon present in effluents affect the degradation efficiency for TOrC during recharge operation Specifically aerobic, oligotrophic microbiological soil environments present favorable conditions for the transformation of TOrC, including rather recalcitrant compounds such as chlorinated flame retardants (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cytotoxic, also known as antineoplastic, drugs remain an important weapon in the fight against cancer. This study considers the water quality implications for the Thames catchment (United Kingdom) arising from the routine discharge of these drugs after use, down the drain and into the river. The review focuses on 13 different cytotoxic drugs from the alkylating agent, antimetabolite, and anthracycline antibiotic families. A geographic-information-system-based water quality model was used in the present study. The model was informed by literature values on consumption, excretion, and fate data to predict raw drinking water concentrations at the River Thames abstraction points at Farmoor, near Oxford, and Walton, in West London. To discover the highest plausible values, upper boundary values for consumption and excretion together with lower removal values for sewage treatment were used. The raw drinking water cytotoxic drug maximum concentrations at Walton (the higher of the two) representative of mean and low flow conditions were predicted to be 11 and 20 ng/L for the five combined alkylating agents, 2 and 4 ng/L for the three combined antimetabolites, and 0.05 and 0.10 ng/L the for two combined anthracycline antibiotics, respectively. If they were to escape into tap water, then the highest predicted concentrations would still be a factor of between 25 and 40 below the current recommended daily doses of concern. Although the risks may be negligible for healthy adults, more concern may be associated with special subgroup populations, such as pregnant women, their fetuses, and breast-feeding infants, due to their developmental vulnerability.

AB Production and use of pharmaceuticals in the United States is high and continues to grow. This, combined with poor wastewater removal rates for drugs in excreted waste, and improper pharmaceutical disposal leads to the presence of pharmaceuticals in fresh- and marine waters and wildlife. In the United States, safe drug take-back boxes, or dropboxes, were established in pharmacies after federal legislation passed in 2014, allowing for year-round safe collection of leftover pharmaceuticals. The overarching objective of this work was to identify opportunities for improving access to proper pharmaceutical disposal. We assessed consumer behavior regarding drug disposal choices and knowledge of dropboxes at pharmacies, investigated pharmacist attitudes toward and recommendations about leftover drug disposal, and compared responses at locations with and without dropboxes. We also explored obstacles to dropbox adoption and usage. We found that customer awareness of dropboxes as well as knowledge about risks of improper disposal are low, however awareness was greater at pharmacies with dropboxes. Additionally, pharmacists at dropbox locations were more consistent in their messaging to customers, more likely to recommend proper disposal methods, and more supportive of drug take-back programs. Through a focus group, we learned that further consumer education would overwhelm the capacity of the existing dropboxes. Based on our findings, we recommend solutions to improper disposal focus on legislation mandating dropboxes at pharmacies and pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to fund proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.

AB High-solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) is a promising method to centralizedly dispose dewatered sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Until now, few studies have focused on determining the different effects of antibiotic residues on methane yield and microbial communities over a wide range of antibiotic loads in HSAD system. This study investigated the effects of seven typical antibiotics (oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin) on HSAD over a wide range of loads (0-500 mg/L). The results showed that 10 mg/L of antibiotics had no obvious effect on CH4 yield. Interestingly, 100 mg/L of antibiotics exhibited a strong stimulating effect on CH4 yield. Antibiotics at a concentration of 500 mg/L generally suppressed CH4 yield at the initial stage of anaerobic digestion, and some systems recovered at the late stage of the process with a much higher daily CH4 yield than other systems. Among the three kinetics models, the modified Gompertz model showed the best fit to the experimental data (R-2: 0.9772-0.9997). Antibiotic residues did not have strong effects on the bacterial community, but did affect the archaeal community. The relative abundance of Methanosarcina increased while that of Methanosaeta and Methanoculleus decreased with the antibiotic concentrations increasing. The heat map showed that the archaeal community in the system with 500 mg/L was characterized by Methanobacteriales and Halobacteriales. This study provides a new insight into the different effects of antibiotics on HSAD.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of caffeine, a widely over-the-counter stimulant drug, has been investigated in effluent wastewater and deionized water (DIW) using graphite-poly vinyl chloride (PVC) composite electrode as anode. Effects of initial concentration of caffeine, chloride ion (Cl-) loading, presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sample volume, type of sample and applied voltage were determined to test and to validate a kinetic model for the oxidation of caffeine by the electrochemical oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of caffeine followed pseudo first-order kinetics, with rate constant values ranged from 0.006 to 0.23 min(-1) depending on the operating parameters. The removal efficiency of caffeine increases with applied voltage very significantly, suggesting a very important role of mediated oxidation process. However, the consumption energy was considered during electrochemical oxidation process. In chloride media, removal of caffeine is faster and more efficiently, although occurrence of more intermediates takes place. The study found that the adding H2O2 to the NaCl solution will inhibit slightly the electrochemical oxidation rate in comparison with only NaCl in solution. Liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) technique was applied to the identification of the by-products generated during electrochemical oxidation, which allowed to construct the proposed structure of by-products.

AB Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a group of widely prescribed antibiotics and have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven FQs (ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), lomefloxacin (LOM), pipemidic acid (PIP) and flumequine (FLU)) and three structurally related amines (1-phenylpiperazine (PP), N-phenylmorpholine (PM) and 4-phenylpiperidine (PD)) toward chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were investigated to elucidate the behavior of FQs during ClO2 disinfection processes. The reaction kinetics are highly pH-dependent, can be well described by a second-order kinetic model incorporating speciation of FQs, and follow the trend of OFL > ENR > CIP similar to NOR similar to LOM > > PIP in reactivity. Comparison among FQs and related amines and product characterization indicate that FQs' piperazine ring is the primary reactive center toward ClO2. ClO2 likely attacks FQ's piperazinyl N4 atom followed by concerted fragmentation involving piperazinyl N1 atom, leading to dealkylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular ring closure at the piperazine moiety. While FQs with tertiary N4 react faster with ClO2 than FQs with secondary N4, the overall reactivity of the piperazine moiety also depends strongly on the quinolone ring through electronic effects. The reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to model the decay of CIP by ClO2 in surface water samples, but overestimate the decay in wastewater samples. Overall, transformation of FQs, particularly for those with tertiary N4 amines, could be expected under typical ClO2 disinfection conditions. However, the transformation may not eliminate antibacterial activity because of little destruction at the quinolone ring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The synthetic hormone sodium levothyroxine (LTX) is one of the most prescribed drugs in the world and the most effective in hypothyroidism treatment. The presence of LTX in the environment has become a matter of major concern due to the widespread use of this hormone and by the fact that it is only partially removed in conventional water and sewage treatment plants. However, information regarding the photochemical fate of this hormone in environmental or engineered systems is scarce in the literature. In this work, the sunlight-driven direct and indirect LTX degradation was investigated by determining the photolysis quantum yield, I broken vertical bar (LTX) = 3.80 (+/- 0.02) x 10(-5), as well as the second-order kinetic constants of the reactions with hydroxyl radicals, k (LTX,aEuro cent OH) = 1.50 (+/- 0.01) x 10(10) L mol(-1) s(-1) and singlet oxygen, k (LTX,1O2) = 1.47 (+/- 0.66) x 10(8) L mol(-1) s(-1). Mathematical simulations indicate that LTX photodegradation is favored in shallow, nitrite-rich, and dissolved organic matter (DOM)-poor environments, with LTX half-life times varying from less than 10 days to about 80 days. LTX removals of 85 and 95% were achieved by UVC photolysis and UVC/H2O2 after 120 min, respectively. Three transformation products, triiodothyronine, diiodothyronine, and diiodotyrosine, were identified during LTX degradation by the UVC-based processes studied. The results herein regarding photo-induced kinetics coupled with environmental fate simulations may help evaluate LTX persistence and also the design of water and wastewater treatment processes.

AB Trace organic chemical (TrOC) contaminants are of concern for finished water from water recycling schemes because of their potential adverse environmental and public health effects. Understanding the impacts of seasonal variations on fate and removal of TrOCs is important for proper operation, risk assessment and management of treatment systems for water recycling such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Accordingly, this study investigated the fate and removal of a wide range of TrOCs through a full-scale MBR plant during summer and winter seasons. TrOCs included 12 steroidal hormones, 3 xeno-estrogens, 2 pesticides and 23 pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Seasonal differences in the mechanisms responsible for removing some of the TrOCs were evident. In particular the contribution of biotransformation and biomass adsorption to the overall removal of estrone, bisphenol A, 1713-estradiol and triclosan were consistently different between the two seasons. Substantially higher percentage removal via biotransformation was observed during the summer sampling peiiod, which compensated for a reduction in removal attributed to biomass adsorption. The opposite was observed during winter, where the contribution of biotransformation to the overall removal of these TrOCs had decreased, which was offset by an improvement in biomass adsorption. The exact mechanisms responsible for this shift are unknown, however are likely to be temperature related as warmer temperatures can lower sorption efficiency, yet enhance biotransformation of these TrOCs.

AB Irrigation with reclaimed water is becoming a common practice in arid- and semi-arid regions as a consequence of structural water resource scarcity. This practice can lead to contamination of the vadose zone if sewage-derived contaminants are not removed properly. In the current work, we have characterized soils from the Guadalete River basin (SW Spain), which are often irrigated with reclaimed water from a nearby wastewater treatment plant and amended using sludge. Physico-chemical, mineralogical and hydraulic properties were measured in soil samples from this area (from surface up to 2 m depth). Emerging contaminants (synthetic surfactants and pharmaceutically active compounds, or PhACs) were also determined. Synthetic surfactants, widely used in personal care products (PCPs), were found in a wide range of concentrations: 73-1300 mu g kg(-1) for linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), 120-496 mu g kg(-1) for alkyl ethoxysulfates (AES), 19-109 mu g kg(-1) for alcohol polyethoxylates (AEOs), and 155-280 mu g kg(-1) for nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs). The presence of surfactant homologues with longer alkyl chains was predominant due to their sorption capacity. A positive correlation was found between LAS and AEOs and soil organic carbon and clay content, respectively. Out of 64 PhACs analyzed, only 7 were detected occasionally (diclofenac, metoprolol, fenofibrate, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, famotidine and hydrochlorothiazide), always at very low concentrations (from 0.1 to 1.3 mu g kg(-1)).

AB Novel methods utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were validated for low-level detection of 104 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ingredients (PPCPs) and four alkylphenols (APs) in environmental samples. The methods were applied to surface water, sediment, and mussel tissue samples collected from San Francisco Bay, CA, USA, an urban estuary that receives direct discharge from over forty municipal and industrial wastewater outfalls. Among the target PPCPs, 35% were detected in at least one sample, with 31, 10, and 17 compounds detected in water, sediment, and mussels, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 92 ng/L in water (valsartan), 33 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments (triclocarban), and 14 ng/g wet weight (ww) in mussels (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Nonylphenol was detected in water (<2-73 ng/L), sediments (22-86 ng/g dw), and mussels (<0.04-95 ng/g ww), and nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylates were detected in sediments (<1-40 ng/g dw) and mussels (<5-192 ng/g ww). The concentrations of PPCPs and APs detected in the San Francisco Bay samples were generally at least an order of magnitude below concentrations expected to elicit toxic effects in aquatic organisms. This study represents the first reconnaissance of PPCPs in mussels living in an urban estuary and provides the first field-derived bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for select compounds in aquatic organisms.

AB Land application of biosolids is a common practice throughout the world. However, concerns continue to be raised about the safety of this practice, because biosolids may contain trace levels of organic contaminants. The present study evaluated the levels of triclocarban (TCC), triclosan (TCS), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in biosolids from 16 wastewater treatment plants and in soils from field plots receiving annual applications of biosolids for 33 years. All of the four contaminants evaluated were detected in most of the biosolids at concentrations ranging from hundreds of mu g/kg to over 1,000 mg/kg (dry wt basis). They were detected at mu g/kg levels in the biosolids-amended soil, but their concentrations decreased sharply with increasing soil depth for 4-NP, PBDEs, and TCC, indicating limited soil leaching of those compounds. However, potential leaching of TCS in the biosolids-amended soils was observed. The levels of all four compounds in the surface soil increased with increasing biosolids application rate. Compared with the estimated 33-year cumulative input to the soil during the 33-year consecutive biosolids application, most of the PBDEs and a small percentage of 4-NP, TCC, and TCS remained in the top 120-cm soil layer. These observations suggest slow degradation of PBDEs but rapid transformation of 4-NP, TCC, and TCS in the biosolids-amended soils. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010; 29: 597-605. (C) 2009 SETAC

AB Data allowing for a complete environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their photoderatives in the environment are still scarce. In the present study, in vitro toxicity and both bio-and photopersistence of various pharmaceuticals (aciclovir, allopurinol, cetirizine, cimetidine, fluconazole, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, phenytoin, primidone, ranitidine, sotalol, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane) as well as their phototransformation products were evaluated in order to fill data gaps and to help prioritise them for further testing. Twelve out of the fourteen compounds investigated were found to be neither readily nor inherently biodegradable in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development-biodegradability tests. The study further demonstrates that the photo-induced transformation of the pharmaceuticals was faster upon irradiation with a Hg lamp (UV light) than with a Xe lamp emitting a spectrum that mimics sunlight. Comparing the non-irradiated with the respective irradiated solutions, a higher acute and chronic toxicity against bacteria was found for the irradiated solutions of seven compounds (cetirizine, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, ranitidine, sulpiride, tramadol and valsartane). No cyto- and genotoxic effects were found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their phototransformation products. This comparative study documents that phototransformation products can arise as a result of UV treatment of wastewater containing these pharmaceuticals. It further demonstrates that some phototransformation products may have a higher environmental risk potential than the respective parent compounds because some phototransformation products exhibited a higher bacterial toxicity.

TI Removal of two cytostatic drugs: bleomycin and vincristine by white-rot
   fungi - a sorption study
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Anticancer drugs; Aquatic systems; Biosorption; Cytostatics; Fungi
AB Purpose Cytostatic drugs cannot be easily removed by conventional sewage treatment plants, resulting in their ultimate release into aquatic systems where they become a threat. Thus, new technologies which can be used to eliminate these drugs more effectively before they enter the environment are increasingly important. Fungal treatment of wastewaters is a promising and environmentally friendly technology for pharmaceutical remediation. The aim of this work is to examine the biosorption of two cytostatics, bleomycin and vincristine, in the aqueous solution by fungal biomass. Methods Five white-rot fungi were used in this study: Fomes fomentarius (CB13), Hypholoma fasciculare (CB15), Phyllotopsis nidulans (CB14), Pleurotus ostreatus (BWPH), and Trametes versicolor (CB8). Tests were conducted on different types of biomass (alive and dead - autoclaved) and in various physico-chemical conditions: varied drug concentrations (5, 10 and 15 mg/L), temperatures (from 15.4 to 29.6 degrees C), and pH (from 3.2 to 8.8). Results The results showed that among alive biomass, T. versicolor (CB8) had the greatest sorption ability for bleomycin and P. nidulans (CB14) worked best for vincristine. The tested sorption process could be described by a pseudo-second order kinetics model. Sorption equilibrium studies demonstrated that for bleomycin Redlich-Peterson, while for vincristine Langmuir model fitted best. The thermodynamic studies showed that the sorption process was endothermic chemisorption for bleomycin, and exothermic physisorption for vincristine. For both drugs the sorption ability increased with an increase of the pH value. Conclusion The biosorption on fungal biomass is a favorable alternative to conventional wastewater treatment processes for anticancer drug removal.

AB Antibiotics are the most consumed therapeutic classes worldwide and are released to the environment in their original form as well as potentially active metabolites and/or degradation products. Consequences of the occurrence of these compounds in the environment are primarily related to bacterial resistance development.
   This work presents a validated analytical method based on solid phase extraction (SPE) using HLB cartridges, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for quantification of seven different fluoroquinolone antibiotics, namely ciprofloxacin (CPF), enrofloxacin (ENR), lomefloxacin (LOM), norfloxacin (NOR), ofloxacin (OFL), prulifloxacin (PLF) and moxifloxacin (MOX) and its application to detect the target compounds in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Linearity was established through calibration curves in solvent and matrix match using internal calibration method in the range of 50-1300 ng L-1 and all the fluoroquinolones showed good linear fit (r(2) >= 0.991). Accuracy ranged between 80.3 and 92.9%, precision was comprised between 7.2 and 14.6%, and 10.7 and 18.1% for intra- and inter-batch determinations, respectively. Method detection and quantification limits ranged from 6.7 to 59.0 ng L-1 and 22.3-196.6 ng L-1, respectively.
   Influents and effluents of fifteen WWTPs of North of Portugal were analyzed. OFL was the fluoroquinolone found at the highest concentration, up to 4587.0 ng L-1 and 987.9 ng L-1, in influent and effluent, respectively. NOR and PLF were not detected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceutical and illicit drug residues potentially arising from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in the Central London portion of the Thames Estuary is presented. Approximately 39 million tonnes of untreated sewage enter the River Thames at 57 CSO points annually. Differential analysis of influents and effluents in a major wastewater treatment plant identified seven potential drug-related CSO markers based on removal rates. Three were present in influent at concentrations >1 mu g L-1 (caffeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine). During dry weather, analysis of hourly samples of river water revealed relatively consistent concentrations for most drugs, including CSO markers, over a tidal cycle. River water was monitored over a week in January and July and then daily across six consecutive weeks in November/December, 2014. Out of 31 compounds monitored, 27 drug residues were determined in the River Thames and, combined, ranged between similar to 1000-3500 ng L-1. Total drug concentration generally declined during extended periods of drier weather. For CSO markers, short-term increases in caffeine, cocaine and benzoylecgonine concentration were observed similar to 24 h after CSO events (especially those occurring at low tide) and generally within one order of magnitude. Timings of elevated occurrence also correlated well with ammonium ion and dissolved oxygen data following CSOs. This work also represents an important study of pharmaceutical occurrence before a major 'Super Sewer' infrastructure upgrade in London aiming to reduce CSOs by 95%. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Steroids are excreted from humans and animals and discharged with wastewaters into the environment, resulting in potential adverse effects on organisms. Based on the excretion rates from different groups of humans and animals, the emissions of seven steroids (estrone (El), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), testosterone (T), androsterone (A), progesterone (P), and cortisol (C)) were comprehensively estimated in 58 river basins of whole China, and their multimedia fate was simulated by using a level III fugacity multimedia model. The results showed that higher emission densities for the steroids were found in the river basins of east China than in west China. This distribution was found to be generally similar to the distribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across China. E3, A, and P displayed higher emission densities than the other steroids in most of the river basins. The total excretion of steroids by humans and animals in China was estimated to be 3069 t/yr. The excretion of steroids from animals was two times larger than that from humans. After various treatments, the total emission of steroids was reduced to 2486 t/yr, of which more than 80% was discharged into the water compartment. The predicted concentrations in water were within an order of magnitude of the measured concentrations available in the literature. Owing to wastewater irrigation, more steroid mass loadings in agricultural soil were found in the basins of Haihe River and Huaihe River in comparison with the other river basins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the emissions and multimedia fate of seven steroids in the river basins of China.

AB An evaluation of the environmental risk assessment (ERA) proposed by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its applicability in Brazil was performed on ten of Belo Horizonte's most pharmaceuticals by the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS). The predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) was proposed, with some refinements to a better representation of the city of study. All PECs obtained were compared only to measured environmental concentrations around the world, due to the lack available data in the city of study and in Brazil. During the performance of EMA's guideline, the risk quotient (RQ) of impact was established through the ratio of PECs and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs). The PECs obtained in more refined phases show the initial evaluation of EMA's guideline, possible subdimensions, and the potential risks. The RQ for all studied pharmaceuticals ranges from clonazepam (1.26) to losartan (5457.45). These results indicate potential risks to the aquatic life present in the streams that receive the wastewater treatment plant's effluent. This risk can be spread since the streams carry these contaminants to other water bodies that undergo to multiple cities of Brazil, and even after dilutions, it can still be potentially toxic to the biotic life. ERA shows that it can be a useful tool for a better understanding and modeling of pharmaceuticals fate in the environment, specifically in water bodies. In addition, the usage of this model shows to be a useful tool that determines which contaminant should follow a more thorough study since the detection and analysis of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples are costly and technically challenging.

AB Ubiquitous detection of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment around the world raises a great public concern. Aquatic residuals of pharmaceuticals have been assumed to relate to land use patterns and various human activities within a catchment or watershed. This study generated a gradient of human activity in the Jiulong River watershed, southeastern China by urban land use percentage in 20 research subwatersheds. Thirty-three compounds from three-category pharmaceuticals [ 26 compounds of 5 antibiotic groups, 6 compounds of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 1 compound of respiratory system drugs (RSDs)] were quantified in stream water before the research subwatershed confluences with two sampling events in dry and wet seasons. In total, 27 out of the 33 pharmaceutical compounds of interest were found in stream waters. Seasonality of instream pharmaceuticals was observed, with less compounds and lower concentrations in the wet season sampling event than in the dry season one. Urban land use in the research subwatershed was identified as the main factor influencing in stream pharmaceutical concentrations and composition regardless of season. Rural land uses contributed a mixture of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals possibly from agricultural application of manure and sewage sludge and aquaculture in the research subwatersheds. Erythromycin in both sampling events showed mediumto high risks to aquatic organisms. Results of this study suggest that urban pharmaceutical management, such as a strict prescription regulations and high-efficient removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment, is critical in reducing aquatic pharmaceutical loads.

AB Tenofovir (9-(R)-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-adenine) is an antiretroviral drug widely used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Tenofovir is extensively and rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. In the expectation that tenofovir could potentially reach agricultural lands through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater, and in the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated its persistence in selected agricultural soils. Less than 10% of [adenine-8-14g-tenofovir added to soils varying widely in texture (sand, loam, clay loam) was mineralized in a 2-month incubation under laboratory conditions. Tenofovir was less readily extractable from clay soils than from a loam or a sandy loam soil. Radioactive residues of tenofovir were removed from the soil extractable fraction with DT(50)s ranging from 24 +/- 2 to 67 + 22 days (first order kinetic model) or 44 + 9 to 127 + 55 days (zero order model). No extractable transformation products were detectable by HPLC. Tenofovir mineralization in the loam soil increased with temperature (range 40 degrees C to 30 degrees C), and did not occur in autoclaved soil, suggesting a microbial basis. Mineralization rates increased with soil moisture content, ranging from air-dried to saturated. In summary, tenofovir was relatively persistent in soils, there were no extractable transformation products detected, and the response of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir mineralization to soil temperature and heat sterilization indicated that the molecule was biodegraded by aerobic microorganisms. Sorption isotherms with dewatered biosolids suggested that tenofovir residues could potentially partition into the particulate fraction during sewage treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical consumption has expanded rapidly during the last century and their persistent presence in the environment has become a major concern. Unfortunately, our understanding of the distribution of pharmaceuticals in surface water and their effects on aquatic biota and public health is limited. Here, we explore patterns in the detection rate of the most frequently studied pharmaceuticals in 64 rivers from 22 countries using bi-clustering algorithms and subsequently analyze the results in the context of regional differences in pharmaceutical consumption habits, social and environmental factors, and removal-efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). We find that 20% of the pharmaceuticals included in this analysis are pervasively present in all the surface waterbodies. Several pharmaceuticals also display low overall positive detection rates; however, they exhibit significant spatial variability and their detection rates are consistently lower in Western European and North America (WEOG) rivers in comparison to Asian rivers. Our analysis suggests the important role of pharmaceutical consumption and population in governing these patterns, however the role of WWTP efficiency appeared to be limited. We were constrained in our ability to assess the role of hydrology, which most likely also plays an important role in regulating pharmaceuticals in rivers. Most importantly though, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to provide probabilistic estimates of the detection rate of pharmaceuticals that were not studied in a river, an exercise that could be useful in prioritizing pharmaceuticals for future study.<bold> </bold>

AB Countless pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exist on the market with more added each day. Many of these compounds are not removed during the wastewater treatment process and enter bodies of water in their active form. EDCs are known to have physiological and behavioral effects in exposed organisms. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a common EDC found in birth control pills, has been found to lead to population collapse after only a few generations in some fish species. Mechanisms identified as potential driving forces for collapse include feminization of males and altered fecundity in both sexes. However, an additional way in which EE2 could lead to population collapse is by altering courtship behavior, which could then change mating preferences and decrease mating opportunities. The current study had the following objectives: determine if exposing female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to EE2 changes mate choice in males; assess if the dose and duration of female exposure matters; and examine if exposing males to EE2 influences their mating preferences. Both unexposed and exposed males were presented with pairs of females that differed in EE2 dose and exposure duration. The results indicate that males were more responsive to EE2-exposed females than unexposed females, with males being most responsive to females exposed to the low versus high dose. Furthermore, exposed males responded less overall than unexposed males. If EE2 concentration increases in the environment, the likelihood of successful mating could decrease and, therefore, potentially lead to adverse population impacts.

AB The growing use of pharmaceutical drug is mainly due to several diseases in human and in animal husbandry. As these drugs are discharged into waterways via wastewater, they cause a major impact on the environment. Many of these drugs are hormones; in which even at low concentrations can alter metabolic and physiological functions in many organisms. Hormones were found in surface water, groundwater, soil, and sediment at concentrations from nanograms to milligrams per liter of volume-quantities known to cause changes in the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. This study aimed to develop a methodology for hormone detection (estriol, estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, progesterone, and testosterone) on surface and treated water samples. Sample toxicity was assessed by ecotoxicology tests using Daphnia magna. A liquid chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source (LC-ESI-MS/ MS) was used for the analysis. The results showed that samples were contaminated by the hormones estriol, estrone, progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol during the sampling period, and the highest concentrations measured were 90, 28, 26, 137, and 194 ng.L-1, respectively. This indicates the inflow of sewage containing these hormones at some points in the Piracicaba River in the State of Sao Paulo-Brazil. Results indicated little toxicity of the hormone estriol in D. magna, indicating that chronic studies with this microcrustacean are necessary.

AB Mefenamic acid (MEF) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated for relief of mild to moderate pain, and for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The presence of MEF in raw and sewage waters has been detected worldwide at concentrations exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration. In this study, using experimental designs, different oxidative processes (H2O2, H2O2/UV, fenton and Photofenton) were simultaneously evaluated for MEF degradation efficiency. The influence and interaction effects of the most important variables in the oxidative process (concentration and addition mode of hydrogen peroxide, concentration and type of catalyst, pH, reaction period and presence/absence of light) were investigated. The parameters were determined based on the maximum efficiency to save time and minimize the consumption of reagents. According to the results, the photo-Fenton process is the best procedure to remove the drug from water. A reaction mixture containing 1.005 mmol L-1 of ferrioxalate and 17.5 mmol L-1 of hydrogen peroxide, added at the initial reaction period, pH of 6.1 and 60 min of degradation indicated the most efficient degradation, promoting 95% of MEF removal. The development and validation of a rapid and efficient qualitative and quantitative HPLC/UV methodology for detecting this pollutant in aqueous solution is also reported. The method can be applied in water quality control that is generated and/or treated in municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of anti-depressants is among the most widely prescribed groups of pharmaceuticals. Consequently, aquatic ecosystems impacted by municipal wastewater discharges are predicted to receive Substantial annual loadings of these compounds. Although SSRIs have been detected in fish tissues, little is known of their uptake and depuration in freshwater fish species. In this study, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed to fluoxetine at a nominal concentration of 0.64 mu g L(-1) for 7 d and subsequently allowed to depurate in clean water over a 21 d period. Fluoxetine uptake by medaka was observed within the first 5 h of exposure and the biologically active metabolite, norfluoxetine, was also detected in medaka tissues during this timeframe. A maximum fluoxetine concentration was measured in medaka by the third day of the uptake phase, yielding an uptake rate constant (k(1)) of 5.9 +/- 0.5 (d(-1)). During the depuration phase of the experiment, a half life of 9.4 +/- 1.1 d was determined for fluoxetine. Using these data, bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of 74 and 80 were estimated for fluoxetine and a pseudo-BCF (the ratio of the concentration of norfluoxetine in medaka and the aqueous fluoxetine concentration) of 117 was calculated for norfluoxetine. These results indicate longer persistence and greater potential for the bioaccumulation or fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in fish tissues than would be predicted from prior half life estimates derived using mammalian species.

AB The purpose of this research was to study the fate and toxicity of triclosan (TCS) in activated sludge systems and to investigate the role of biodegradation and sorption on its removal. Two continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used; one system was used as a control, while the other received TCS concentrations equal to 0.5 and 2 mg 1(-1). At the end of the experiment, 1 mg 1(-1) TCS was added in the control system to investigate TCS behaviour and effects on non-acclimatized biomass. For all concentrations tested, more than 90% of the added TCS was removed during the activated sludge process. Determination of TCS in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of its mass flux revealed that TCS was mainly biodegraded. Activated sludge ability to biodegrade TCS depended on biomass acclimatization and resulted in a mean biodegradation of 97%. Experiments with batch and continuous-flow systems revealed that TCS is rapidly sorbed on the suspended solids and afterwards, direct biodegradation of sorbed TCS is performed. Regarding TCS effects on activated sludge process, addition of 0.5 mg 1-1 TCS on non-acclimatized biomass initially deteriorated ammonia removal and nitrification capacity. After acclimatization of biomass, nitrification was fully recovered and further increase of TCS to 2 mg 1(-1) did not affect the performance of activated sludge system. The effect of TCS on organic substrate removal was minor for concentrations up to 2 mg 1-1, indicating that heterotrophic microorganisms are less sensitive to TCS than nitrifiers.

AB Pinpointing environmental antibiotic resistance (AR) hot spots in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is hindered by a lack of available and comparable AR monitoring data relevant to such settings. Addressing this problem, we performed a comprehensive spatial and seasonal assessment of water quality and AR conditions in a Malaysian river catchment to identify potential "simple" surrogates that mirror elevated AR. We screened for resistant coliforms, 22 antibiotics, 287 AR genes and integrons, and routine water quality parameters, covering absolute concentrations and mass loadings. To understand relationships, we introduced standardized "effect sizes" (Cohen's D) for AR monitoring to improve comparability of field studies. Overall, water quality generally declined and environmental AR levels increased as one moved down the catchment without major seasonal variations, except total antibiotic concentrations that were higher in the dry season (Cohen's D > 0.8, P < 0.05). Among simple surrogates, dissolved oxygen (DO) most strongly correlated (inversely) with total AR gene concentrations (Spearman's. 0.81, P < 0.05). We suspect this results from minimally treated sewage inputs, which also contain AR bacteria and genes, depleting DO in the most impacted reaches. Thus, although DO is not a measure of AR, lower DO levels reflect wastewater inputs, flagging possible AR hot spots. DO measurement is inexpensive, already monitored in many catchments, and exists in many numerical water quality models (e.g., oxygen sag curves). Therefore, we propose combining DO data and prospective modeling to guide local interventions, especially in LMIC rivers with limited data.

AB Chicken feather, which is consisted of keratin, has always been abandoned as solid waste. The utilization technologies of waste keratin have been developed in electric zones and materials fields so far. Recently, numerous new types of adsorbents have been used for antibiotic removal. The chicken feather carbon is supposed to be a potential one. In this study, an activated feather carbon (AFC) was developed as the absorbent of amoxicillin (AMOX) in simulated waste-water. The micropore structures of AFC were detected by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was recorded and analyzed. A BET surface area, as high as 1838.86 m(2)/g, was measured in this study. At the meantime, a rapid adsorption (5 similar to 7 min) and high removal efficiency (99.63%) could be observed. The kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption ofAMOX by AFC was an exothermic physic-adsorption. The interaction between AMOX and AFC surface was supposed to be a multiple-layer adsorption process for it is well fitted with the Freundlich model. The adsorption behavior could be described by pseudo-second-order model almost perfectly in kinetic studies. In addition, effect of pH, ionic strength, and reusability properties were also discussed in this paper. The AFC was proved to be the most rapid, efficient, and economically absorbent for AMOX removal, which was effective enough under various temperatures and saline circumstances. It was also proved useful, convenient, and renewable in dealing with the tough antibiotic pollutant problems and rebuilding of antibiotic sewage treatment facilities.

AB The behaviour of residues of antibiotic drugs during bank filtration was studied at a field site in Berlin, Germany, where bank-filtered water is used for the production of drinking water. The neighbouring surface water used for bank filtration is under the influence of treated municipal wastewater. Seven out of 19 investigated antimicrobial residues were found in the surface water with median concentrations between 7 and 151 ng L-1. Out of the seven analytes detected in the surface water only three (anhydroerythromycin, clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole) were found with median concentrations above their limits of quantitation in bank filtrate with a travel time of one month or less. With the exception of sulfamethoxazole, none of the 19 analytes were present in bank filtrate with a residence time larger than one month or in the water-supply well itself. Sulfamethoxazole found with a median concentration of 151 ng L-1 in the surface water was the most persistent of all antimicrobial residues. Nevertheless, it was also removed by more than 98% and only found with a median concentration of 2 ng L-1 in the water-supply well. The degradation of clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole appear to be redox-dependent. Clindamycin was eliminated more efficiently under oxic infiltration conditions while sulfamethoxazole was eliminated more rapidly under anoxic infiltration conditions. A slight preference for an improved degradation under oxic (clarithromycin and roxithromycin) or anoxic (anhydroerythromycin) conditions was also observed for the macrolide antibiotics. Nevertheless, all macrolides were readily removable by bank filtration both under oxic and anoxic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The leaching behaviour of six selected pharmaceuticals was tested in different soils. Leaching experiments are a part of environmental risk assessment to estimate the distribution and fate of these pharmaceuticals in the environment. Based on the results of this assessment their mobility in soil and their potential to contaminate groundwater was evaluated. When assessing the leaching behaviour of these compounds, the influence of the properties (e.g. grain size distribution, pH, C-org) of different soils has to be taken into account. The test results indicated that the leaching potential found could be rated as low for diazepam, ibuprofen, ivermectin and carbamazepine. Therefore, contamination of the groundwater with these substances seems to be unlikely if the groundwater level is covered with sufficient layers of the soils investigated. Clofibric acid and iopromide were very mobile under the experimental conditions and thus, groundwater contamination would be possible if the soil is exposed to these pharmaceuticals, i.e. wastewater irrigation. These results are more or less in agreement with groundwater monitoring data found in the literature for ibuprofen and diazepam which were in general not present in groundwater, while clofibric acid and iopromide were frequently detected. However, a discrepancy was found for carbamazepine, since it occurs very often in groundwater. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the leaching tests were performed with soil, whereas in reality the groundwater contamination. occurs mainly over river sediments and sub soil from receiving waters.

AB Several methods for evaluating the toxicity and biodegradability of hazardous pollutants (chlorinated compounds, chemical additives and pharmaceuticals) have been studied in this work. Different bioassays using representative bacteria of marine and terrestrial ecosystems such as Vibrio fischeri and Pseudomonas putida have been used to assess the ecotoxicity. Activated sludge was used to analyse the effect of those pollutants in a biological reactor of a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results demonstrate that none of the compounds is toxic to activated sludge, except ofloxacin to P. putida. The additives tested can be considered moderately toxic according to the more sensitive V. fischeri assays, whereas the EC50 values of the pharmaceuticals depend on the specific microorganism used in each test. Regarding the biodegradability, respirometric measurements were carried out for fast biodegradability assessment and the Zahn-Wellens test for inherent biodegradability. The evolution of the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) showed that only diethyl phthalate was easily biodegradable and acetylsalicylic acid was partially biodegradable (98% and 65% degradation, respectively). The persistence of dichloromethane, ofloxacin and hidrochlorothiazide was confirmed along the 28 days of the Zahn-Wellens test whereas 1,1,1-trichloroethane showed inherent biodegradability (74% removal). Most of the chlorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals, bisphenol A and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were partially degraded in 28 d with total organic carbon (TOC) reduction ranging from 21% to 51%. Sulphamethoxazole showed certain biodegradation (50% removal) with TOC decrease around 31%, which indicates the formation of non-biodegradable by-products.

AB Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are widely used tricyclic antidepressant drugs. They have been detected in wastewater, surface runoff, and effluents from sewage treatment plants. As such, they could potentially reach agriculture land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water. In the absence of data on their fate in the environment, the persistence and dissipation pathways of radiolabeled amitriptyline were determined in three agriculture soils varying widely in texture and chemical properties (loam soil, clay loam soil, and sandy loam soil). Tritiated amitriptyline was added to laboratory microcosms containing soils, and the metabolism of the extractable 3H was monitored during incubation at 30 degrees C. The total solvent extractable radioactivity decreased in all three soils with times to dissipate 50% of material (DT50) ranging from 34.1 +/- 3.2 (loam soil) to 85.3 +/- 3.2 d (sandy soil). Nortriptyline (N-desmethyl amitriptyline) and amitriptyline-N-oxide were identified as major transformation products in all three soils by high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS/UV). The addition of liquid municipal biosolids to the loam soil had no effect on the dissipation of amitriptyline. The persistence of nortriptyline was evaluated in the loam soil. The DT50 of nortriptyline was 40.5 +/- 3.2 d estimated with HPLC-TOF-MS/UV. Approximately 10% of added nortriptyline was converted to hydroxylated products after 50 d of incubation. In summary, amitriptyline persisted in agricultural soils with major dissipation mechanisms, including forming nonextractable residues and producing various transformation products including the psychoactive drug nortriptyline.

AB A continuous injection experiment was implemented in a pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system to evaluate the behavior of four pharmaceuticals and personal care products (i.e. ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and tonalide) and a phenolic estrogenic compound (i.e. bisphenol A). The treatment system consisted of an anaerobic reactor as a primary treatment, followed by two 0.65 m(2) wetlands (81 and B2) working in parallel and connected to a 1.65 m(2) wetland (B3) operating in series. Overall removal efficiencies for the selected compounds ranged from 97% to 99%. The response curves of the injected pollutants show that the behavior of these compounds strongly depends on their sorption and biodegradation characteristics. While about 50% of ibuprofen was removed in B1 and 82, 99% was achieved at B3, where the dissolved oxygen concentration was significantly higher (B1-B2 = 0.5 mg L-1 and B3 = 5.4 mg L-1). Naproxen and diclofenac were efficiently removed (93%) in B1 and B2, revealing anaerobic degradation as a probable removal mechanism. Moreover, tonalide and bisphenol A were readily removed in the small wetlands (94% and 83%, respectively), where the removal of total suspended solids was 93%. Therefore, given their high hydrophobicity, sorption onto the particulate matter stands for the major removal mechanism. However, the tentative identification of carboxy-bisphenol A as an intermediate degradation product in B3 suggested biodegradation as a relevant bisphenol A removal pathway under aerobic prevailing conditions.

AB On considering the critical issues in attaining stringent water quality standards and not creating any environmental impacts, we focused for the first time the economically feasible, emerging technology known as Selfassembly flocculating (Saf process). In which, the study investigated the applicability of bioflocculant (a biopolymer-self-assembly in nature) act as a surrogates on relying the removal of broad spectrum of substances under optimized conditions (Dosage: 90 mg/L; pH: 7; CaCl2). On using different techniques, the results have proved in removing the organic matter such as pharmaceuticals (Gentamycin, Cholecalciferol, Fluvoxamine, 3-OH Desogestrel, and Pheniramine), endocrine disturbing compounds [Phthalic acid, Benzene, 1, 2, 4 -Trime-thoxy 5 (1 Propenyl), Benzene, 1, 2 Dimethoxy 4 (2 Propeny1)-, 1, 2-Benzenedicarboxylic Acid, 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol], fluorescent components (Polysaccharide like material), and others. The toxicological assessment of self-assembly bioflocculant implemented on zebra fish were statistically correlated [r = 0.95, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P-1 WW; r = 0.91, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P2WW] and [r = 0.7 5, p < 0.05 for P1WT; r = 0.095, p < 0.01 and 0.05 for P2WT]. This integrated approach supplemented further information of zeta potential (-16 mV in P1WW and -14.6 mV in P2WW decreased to -1.05 mV and -1.56 mV) with particle size distribution to explain via Saf process. In this research, the new insight has established non-toxic, self-assembly, biodegradable, bioflocculant for effective bioremediation.

AB Industrial fermentations for the production of pharmaceuticals generate large volumes of waste water that can be biologically treated to recover plant nutrients through the application of pharmaceutical-derived wastes to the soil. Nevertheless, benefits and risks associated with their recovery are still unexplored. Thus, the aim of the present work was to characterize three potential organic residues (sludge, anaerobic digestate and compost) derived from the wastewater generated by the daptomycin production process. The main parameters evaluated were the physico-chemical properties, potential contaminants (heavy metals, pathogens and daptomycin residues), organic matter stabilization and the potential toxicity towards soil microorganisms and plants. The results showed that all the studied materials were characterized by high concentrations of plant macronutrients (N, P and K), making them suitable for agricultural reuse. Heavy metal contents and pathogens were under the limits established by European and Italian legislations, avoiding the risk of soil contamination. The compost showed the highest organic matter stabilization within the studied materials, whereas the sludge and the anaerobic digestate were characterized by large amounts of labile organic compounds. Although the pharmaceutical-derived fertilizers did not negatively affect the soil microorganisms, as demonstrated by the enzymatic activities, the sludge and the anaerobic digestate caused a moderate and strong phytotoxicity, respectively. The compost showed no toxic effect towards plant development and, moreover, it positively affected the germination and growth in lettuce and barley. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that the valorization of pharmaceutical-derived materials through composting permits their agricultural reuse and also represents a suitable strategy to move towards a zero-waste production process for daptomycin.

AB Trimethoprim (TMP) is a widely prescribed antibiotic frequently detected in the aquatic environment. This study investigates the reactions of TMP and two sub structure model compounds [2, 4-diamino-5-methylpyrimidine (DAMP) and 3, 4, 5-trimethoxytoluene (TMT)] with chlorine dioxide (ClO2), one of the common water disinfection oxidants, in batch reactors. A second-order kinetic model that incorporates the organic compounds' acid-base speciation can sufficiently describe the reaction kinetics and is used to evaluate molecules' reactive sites. TMP's apparent second-order rate constant (k(app)) with ClO2 ranges at 5-33 M-1 . s(-1) from pH 2.7 to 9.1, corresponding to a half-life of 40.8 min at pH 7 and 1 mg/L of ClO2. The reaction's pH dependence is linked to protonation of the ring nitrogens on TMP's 2, 4-diaminopyrimidinyl moiety. Comparison among TMP, DAMP, and TMT reveals that the reactivity of TMP to ClO2 resides mostly in its diaminopyrimidinyl moiety at neutral to alkaline pH, but centers in its trimethoxybenzyl moiety at acidic conditions. LC/MS analysis shows that oxidation of TMP by ClO2 generates Cl and OH substitutions at both diaminopyrimidinyl and trimethoxybenzyl moieties and other products. The reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix can be used to model the decay of TMP by ClO2 in surface water samples, but overestimate the decay in wastewater samples. Overall, transformation of TMP by ClO2 can be expected under typical ClO2 disinfection conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000420. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB A priority environmental problem is pollution and disturbance of natural environments by emerging pollutants - substances of various origins and structures and with known and/or potential ecotoxic effects. One of the most dangerous groups of emerging pollutants is pharmaceutical substances due to their highly stable chemical structure and pronounced biological activity. They are found in soil, bottom sediments, surface, sewage, groundwater and drinking water. Uncontrolled release of pharmaceuticals in open ecosystems is potentially dangerous, entailing environmental consequences. Their negative impacts on living organisms are evident. This has driven the search for effective ways to neutralise persistent pollutants. In Russia, pharmaceutical pollution of the environment has commenced recently and is still presented as research with a local focus. In particular, the dynamics and metabolic mechanisms of pharma pollutants by Rhodococcus actinobacteria, outstanding among other microorganisms for their capacity to degrade a great diversity of degradable pollutants, are most intensively investigated. These studies are implemented at the junction of organic chemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, and pharmacology. They include a set of interrelated fundamental tasks, such as developing drug detection methods in the cultivation media of microorganisms, elucidating the relationships between the systematic affiliation of microorganisms and their ability to degrade chemically different drug substances, as well as studying the degree of biodegradability and toxic effects of new compounds on the degrading microorganisms, and also the features of their decomposition and co-metabolism. Solving these tasks is important to enable understanding of the environmental fate of pharmaceuticals and to create prerequisites for innovative technical solutions in the advanced treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. It is also essential for the development of environmentally safe approaches to hazardous pharmaceutical waste management.

AB Laboratory tests were conducted with five endocrine disruptors (bishenol A, triclosan. nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate and nonylphenol diethoxylate) under different redox conditions (aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic and sulfate-reducing conditions) to assess abiotic and biotic degradation in a river water/sediment system. The river water sample was collected from Spercheios River while the sediment was collected from the banks of a tributary of the river at the point where the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant is located. To describe quantitatively elimination kinetics of the target compounds, pseudo first-order kinetics were adopted. According to the results from the microcosms studies, it can be stated that the substances are eliminated from the aqueous phase with relatively high rates under aerobic conditions due to both sorption and biotransformation processes. However, when reduced oxygen conditions were established in the microcosms incubations, biotransformation decreased, indicating the almost complete cease of the EDCs microbial degradation, while substances' sorption onto sediments showed no significant differences. All compounds were found to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions, and the low to high order of the calculated dissipation rate constants was 0.064 +/- 0.004 d(-1) (TCS) -> 0.067 +/- 0.006 d(-1) (NP) -> 0.076 +/- 0.009 d(-1) (Spercheios) -> 0.081 +/- 0.007 d(-1) (NP1EO) - 0.103 = 0.011 d -1 ( BPA). Finally, regarding the biotransformation experiments, the elimination of the compounds limited in the absence of oxygen as compared to aerobic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-component screening analysis method for polar to medium-polar water pollutants was developed. Sample clean-up and group separation are performed by sequential solid-phase extraction ( SSPE) using automated SPE with C18 and polymeric sorbent materials. Analyses are performed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) using a single-quadrupole instrument. More than 90 priority compounds of environmental interest - comprising the most important chemical and substance classes: phenols, carboxylic acids, aromatic sulfonates, aromatic amines, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, dyes, and pesticides - have been chosen for the experiments. The compounds are divided by the SSPE procedure into 3 different polarity classes. The extraction recoveries were determined in the 3 fractions for every single substance, and were for most of the analytes in the range of 50-100%. A mixture of hexane - dichloromethane was used for the elution of nonpolar compounds like alkylphenols from C18. Methanol and acetone are well suited for the elution of more polar substances. The limits of detection (LODs) were determined for all compounds. Effluents from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treating waste water from textile industries, and the corresponding receiving waters ( rivers and lakes) have been analysed with the developed method. Urban and industrial pollution was observed in rivers and streams in the area north of Milan, Italy. In the water samples different phenols (nitrophenols, bisphenol A, nonylphenol), alkylphenol ethoxylate surfactants, their metabolites with endocrine disrupting potential, aromatic sulfonates, linear alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants, dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and a dichlorobenzidine compound were identified.

AB Most anti-tumour agents are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, embryotoxic or fetotoxic. Only little is known about the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals. Unmetabolized active substances are excreted and will show up in municipal wastewater. Therefore, we examined the biodegradability of the widely used antitumour agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), also as an example for assessing the impact of hospital effluent on the biodegradation of a test compound. The biodegradability of the structurally similar anti-tumour agents cytarabine and gemcitabine was also examined. Test systems used were the closed bottle test (OECD 301 D) and the modified Zahn-Wellens test (OECD 302 B). 5-FU was not biodegradable in the closed bottle test (CBT) nor in the Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT). At the highest concentration of 5-FU, with hospital effluent an inhibition of the degradation of substances present in hospital effluent was observed, probably as a result of a synergistic effect by 5-FU with antibiotics present in hospital sewage. Gemcitabine was biodegraded 42% in the CBT. The prolongation of the test period to 40 days only improved the result to 45%. In the ZWT, the biodegradation of gemcitabine was 50%. Cytarabine was partially biodegraded in the CBT (50%), but only after an adaptation period of 20 days. After a test prolongation to 40 days, the degree of biodegradation was 80%. In the ZWT, the biodegradability was > 95% after only a few days.

AB We demonstrate a challenge-based innovation of End of Life Tyres (ELTs) pyrolysis for magnetic pyrochar production and synthesis with evidence of its use as low cost, novel adsorbent for pharmaceuticals removal from aqueous solutions. Magnetic tyre pyrochar (MTC) derived from ELTs at Technology Readiness Level 3-7 (TRL3-7), was tested for the removal of ciprofloxacin (CIP), propranolol (PRO) and clomipramine (CLO), from water, at varied pH and ionic strengths. The morphological and chemical properties of the adsorbents were assessed using Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area, Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FFIR), Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS), elemental analysis and zeta potential measurements. MTC showed excellent adsorption efficiency of 85%, 90% and 92% for CIP, PRO and CLO respectively, higher than that of the non-magnetic tyre pyrochar (TC), due to the larger surface area, and porosity and lower polarity. Adsorption of the compounds onto MTC was highly pH dependent, and favourable at low ionic strength. The experimental data were well described by pseudo-second order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm models. Based on FTIR and zeta potential analysis, the interaction mechanisms were explained by cation-pi, pi-pi EDA, cation exchange, electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic effect. In the context of the circular economy, this ELTs based low cost magnetic adsorbent (estimated at $299/t) can be potentially used at full-scale industrial wastewater treatment for elimination of drugs from aqueous solutions, offering sustainable environmental remediation.

AB Due to widespread occurrence of lipid lowering drugs such as statins, fibrates and their metabolites in the aquatic environments, there is a worldwide growing concern in their role in water quality and aquatic biota. However, this concern is limited by ability to address their occurrence, distribution, fate and eco-toxicological effects. This study focuses on the quantification of the levels of statins, fibrates and their metabolites in the aquatic environments using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The developed UHPLC-QTOF-MS based method was successfully applied to the analysis of statins, fibrates and metabolites in real water samples collected from Daspoort WWWs influent and effluent and Apies River. A series of statin compounds (mevastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin), fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) and the corresponding metabolites (clofibric and fenofibric acids) were detected and quantified in the range of 0.56-19.90 mg/L in both waste and River water samples. In general, the results of the present study are an indication of pollution hazards from wastewater treatment processes and these levels poses a huge risk to the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms. Thus, regulating the limit levels of statins, fibrates and metabolites in any type of water is paramount as it will provide the vital information on the toxic risks associated with organic pollutants of pharmaceutical origin.

AB BACKGROUNDPiroxicam (PRX) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve pain and swelling of conditions like arthritis. PRX has been extensively detected in seawater, surface, and sewage waters worldwide and therefore its efficient treatment is an issue of emerging concern. In this work, the sonochemical degradation of PRX was investigated.
   RESULTSAll experiments were conducted at constant ultrasound frequency of 20kHz while the following range of experimental conditions was investigated: initial PRX concentration 320-960 mu g L-1, ultrasound power density 20-60W L-1, temperature 20-60 degrees C, reaction time up to 60min. The effect of different water matrices, namely surface water (SW), bottled water (BW), ultrapure water (UPW) and humic acid (HA) aqueous solution on process efficiency was also explored. It was found that PRX degradation reached 96% after only 10min of treatment under the best conditions (i.e. [PRX](0)=320mg L-1, 20 degrees C, 36W L-1) assayed. Power density could positively affect PRX degradation. Nevertheless, PRX degradation decreased when its initial concentration and the temperature of the bulk liquid was increased. PRX degradation was found to decrease, in different water matrices, in the order: UPW>5mg L-1 HA>BW>10mg L-1 HA>SW. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 14 transformation by-products (TBPs) were formed and subsequently degraded during treatment while the PRX degradation pathways were also elucidated.
   CONCLUSIONAt the optimal operating conditions assayed, PRX was efficiently degraded after about 10min of sonochemical oxidation, thus rendering it a promising technology for the treatment of xenobiotics. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Trace organic contaminant (TrOC) studies in Australia have, to date, focused on wastewater effluents, leaving a knowledge gap of their occurrence and risk in freshwater environments. This study measured 42 TrOCs including industrial compounds, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry at 73 river sites across Australia quarterly for 1 yr. Trace organic contaminants were found in 92% of samples, with a median of three compounds detected per sample (maximum 18). The five most commonly detected TrOCs were the pharmaceuticals salicylic acid (82%, maximum = 1530 ng/L), paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen; 45%, maximum = 7150 ng/L), and carbamazepine (27%, maximum = 682 ng/L), caffeine (65%, maximum = 3770 ng/L), and the flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (44%, maximum = 184 ng/L). Pesticides were detected in 28% of the samples. To determine the risk posed by the detected TrOCs to the aquatic environment, hazard quotients were calculated by dividing the maximum concentration detected for each compound by the predicted no-effect concentrations. Three of the 42 compounds monitored (the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole and the herbicide simazine) had a hazard quotient >1, suggesting that they may be causing adverse effects at the most polluted sites. A further 10 compounds had hazard quotients >0.1, indicating a potential risk; these included four pharmaceuticals, three personal care products, and three pesticides. Most compounds had hazard quotients significantly <0.1. The number of TrOCs measured in this study was limited and further investigations are required to fully assess the risk posed by complex mixtures of TrOCs on exposed biota.

AB Pharmacologically active substances used to treat human and animal illnesses can enter the aquatic environment via effluents from wastewater treatment plants or in the case of veterinary drugs directly through liquid manure discharge. Some of these substances enter the environment either as the parent compound or as active/inactive metabolites. Due to their pharmacological activity, their determination and understanding their behavior and fate in the environment are important.
   The scope of this paper was to develop an analytical procedure to determine common pharmaceutical residues in wastewaters. Pharmacologically active substances were chosen according to their wide spread application in Slovenia and Central Europe and are members of analgesics, e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac. Selected compounds were isolated from synthetic water using a novel SPE sorbent Strata (TM) X. Due to the non-volatile nature of these compounds they were first silylised prior to gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric detection. The developed procedure was tested with synthetic wastewaters and their extraction efficiency (> 84%) and method limits of detection (2-6 ng L-1) were determined. Our procedure has been adopted and optimised for "real'' water samples and applied to eleven drinking and ten river water samples from Slovenia. The results showed no traces of NSAIDs in all potable water samples and low-range contamination (ng L-1) of Slovene rivers. These results show that NSAIDs contamination of Slovene waters is comparable with published results of water contamination in Central Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB On-site sewage treatment systems can be an important source of antibiotic resistant bacteria and organic micropollutants into adjacent groundwater. Due to the frequent proximity of private wells to septic systems, this contamination is a concern to communities that do not have access to public municipal services. In both rural and urban environments, low-income communities, indigenous communities and those of color are disproportionately affected by well contamination. The objective of this study was to assess well water quality in an underserved North Carolina community by performing a comprehensive evaluation of microbial and organic micropollutant occurrence and determining possible sources of contamination. Well water, septic tanks, and adjacent municipal water were sampled. Culture- and molecular biology-based microbial analysis and non-targeted, high resolution mass spectrometry chemical analysis were conducted to assess water quality in comparison to nearby municipal water. Three of thirteen homes had between 1 and 6.3 CFUs/100 mL of E. coli and two homes had fecal bacteria resistant to antibiotics in their well water. The water of four homes showed concentrations of the artificial sweetener sucralose, a wastewater tracer, higher than the municipal water (range similar to 60-1500 ng L-1). The human-specific HF183 fecal marker was detected in 79% of the wells tested. The presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in four home wells, along with the presence of pesticides and insecticides in two homes, suggest possible contamination from septic tanks and lawn care runoff. The implications of this work highlight the necessity of wider scale contaminant evaluation of well water. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems provokes increasing concern due to their potential risk to non-target organisms and to human health. Pharmaceuticals are used in both human and veterinary medicine and are essentially released into the environment via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from livestock. In this study, 31 pharmaceuticals were analyzed in effluent and surface water upstream and downstream of two WWTPs in the Loue-Doubs rural karstic catchment in Eastern France. Diclofenac (965 and 2476 ng L-1), sulfamethoxazole (655 and 1380 ng L-1) and carbamazepine (566 and 1007 ng L-1) displayed the highest levels in the effluents of both WWTPs. Diclofenac levels were also high in surface water samples 300 and 166 ng L-1 in the River Doubs and the River Loue, respectively, followed by paracetamol (273 and 158 ng L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (126 and 73 ng L-1). In both rivers, the most critical compounds were found to be the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (risk quotient (RQ) from 23.7 to 51.1) and ofloxacine (RQ from 1.1 to 18.9), which reached levels inducing toxic effects in aquatic organisms. This study showed that WWTP effluents are the major sources of the pharmaceuticals, but raw discharges from human residences, pastures and livestock manure represent significant sources of contamination of surface water and groundwater. The aim of this study was to assist scientists and authorities in understanding occurrence and sources of pharmaceuticals in order to improve water quality management in chalk streams.

AB Human pharmaceuticals have been detected in the terrestrial environment at mu g to mg kg(-1) concentrations. Repeated application of sewage sludge (biosolids) and increasing reclaimed wastewater use for irrigation could lead to accumulation of these novel contaminants in soil systems. Despite this, potential phytotoxicological effects on higher plants have rarely been evaluated. These studies aimed to test effects upon germination, development, growth and physiology of two crop plants, namely radish (Raphanus sativus Spakler 3) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa All Year Around), after exposure to different, but structurally related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. A range of biological endpoints comprising biomass, length, water content, specific root and shoot length, root to shoot ratio, daily progress of stages of cell elongation and organ emergence (primary root, hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon emergence, cotyledon opening, and no change), as well as photosynthetic measurements were evaluated. Compounds from the fenamic acid class were found to affect R. sativus root endpoints (root length and water content), while ibuprofen affected early root development of L. sativa. In general, phytotoxicological effects on root endpoints demonstrated that impacts upon higher plants are not only compound specific, but also differ between plant species. It was found that the usage of a wide range of biological endpoints (all simple, cost-effective and ecologically relevant) were beneficial in detecting differences in plant responses to NSAID exposure. Due to paucity and discrepancy within the few previously available phytotoxicological studies with pharmaceuticals, it is now essential to allocate time and resources to consider development of suitable chronic toxicity tests, and some suggestions regarding this are presented.

AB A novel aerobic sludge digestion process to stabilize and decrease the amount of excess sludge produced during biological treatment and removal of EDCs sorbed onto sludge during this process is discussed here. Waste activated sludge samples from two different wastewater treatment plants were ozonated for different periods in Erlenmeyer flasks once a day on each of four consecutive days. Flasks were continuously aerated between ozone applications by shaking on an orbital shaker. The residual EDC concentrations in sludge samples were analyzed at the end of digestion periods. An MLVSS reduction of up to 95% was achieved with an ozone dose of only 1.05 g O-3/kg MLSS in this process on the fourth day. During this process destruction of some selected endocrine disrupting compounds, namely diltiazem, carbamazepine, butyl benzyl phthalate, acetaminophen and two natural hormones, estrone and progesterone, which tend to accumulates in sludge, are studied. Over 99% removal of these contaminants were achieved at the end of the fourth day. The analyses were conducted by using LC (ESI) MS/MS after solid phase extraction (SPE). By this process it became possible to save on contact time as well as achieving a bio-solids digestion far exceeding the standard aerobic process and concomitant removal of micropollutants at the expense of minimum ozone dose. The developed process is deemed superior over side-stream ozonation of activated sludge, in that it does not cause reduction in active biomass in the aeration tank. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of nine pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, caffeine, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, diclofenac, nitrofurazone, sulfamethoxazole. and triclosan) and to evaluate potential risks (human health and ecotoxicological) in Lui, Gombak and Selangor (Malaysia) rivers using commercial competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit assays. Physicochemical properties of these rivers showed the surface samples belong to Class II of Malaysian National Water Quality Standards which requires conventional treatment before consumption. All the pharmaceuticals were detected in all three rivers except for triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac which were not detected in few of sampling locations in these three rivers. Highest pharmaceutical concentrations were detected in Gombak river in line of being as one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were detected in all the sampling locations with the highest at 299.88 ng/L. While triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac concentrations were not detected in a few of sampling locations in these three rivers. All these nine pharmaceuticals were within the levels reported previously in literature. Pharmaceutical production, wastewater treatment technologies and treated sewage effluent were found as the potential sources which can be related with pharmaceuticals occurrence in surface water samples. Potential human risk assessment showed low health risk except for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone. Instead, ecotoxicological risk assessment indicated moderate risks were present for these rivers. Nevertheless, results confirmation using instrumental techniques is needed for higher degree of specificity. It is crucial to continuously monitor the surface water bodies for pharmaceuticals using a cost- effective prioritisation approach to assess sensitive sub-populations risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study is focused on the Guadalete River basin (SW, Spain), where extreme weather conditions have become common, with and alternation between periods of drought and extreme rainfall events. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) occur when heavy rainfall events exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), as well as pollution episodes in parts of the basin due to uncontrolled sewage spills and the use of reclaimed water and sludge from the local WWTP.The sampling was carried out along two seasons and three campaigns during dry (March 2007) and extreme rainfall (April and December 2010) in the Guadalete River, alluvial aquifer and Jerez de la Frontera aquifer.Results showed minimum concentrations for synthetic surfactants in groundwater (< 37.4 mu g.L- 1) during the first campaign (dry weather conditions), whereas groundwater contaminants increased in December 2010 as the heavy rainfall caused the river to overflow.In surface water, surfactant concentrations showed similar trends to groundwater observations.In addition to surfactants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were analyzed in the third campaign, 22 of which were detected in surface waters. Two fragrances (OTNE and galaxolide) and one analgesic/anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) were the most abundant PPCPs (up to 6540, 2748 and 1747 ng.L-1, respectively).Regarding ground water, most PPCPswere detected in Jerez de la Frontera aquifer, where a synthetic fragrance (OTNE) was predominant (up to 1285 ng.L-1).

AB Acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical pollutants in the environment and has been classified under among the emerging organic pollutants (EOPs). The increasing concentration of it in our environment is not only harmful to the ecosystem, but also to the humans as well. In this study, the microscopy, biochemical test and 16S rRNA sequencing the characterization of APAP as the sole degrading stains viz.Staphylococcus sciuristrain DPP1 (MN744326),Bacillus subtilisstrain DPP3 (MN744327),Bacillus paralicheniformisstrain DKP1 (MN744324),Enterococcus faeciumstrain DKP2 (MN744325) and DDP2 (MT705211) were performed. Haldane's growth kinetic model was used to identify specific growth rate and observed for DPP1 (485 mg/L), DPP3 (593 mg/L), DKP1 (477 mg/L), DKP2 (702 mg/L) and DDP2 (685 mg/L). The maximum specific growth rate was reported for the stains viz. DPP1, DPP3, DKP1, DKP2, and DDP2, was in order of 0.076, 0.223, 0.259, 0.179, and 0.141, respectively. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was used to identify the effect of physical parameters on degradation using mathematical modeling. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the strains DPP1, DPP3, DKP1, DKP2, and DDP2 had significant F-value and regression coefficient (R-2) value of 0.01%, 0.06%, 0.37%, and 0.18%, respectively. The co-culture of the five strains has utilized 1200 mg/L of APAP within 70 h while individual strains took 10 days. The intermediate metabolites like 4-aminophenol, benzamide, (R)-2-methylpentanoic acid, methylene-3-vinyl cyclohexane, and 1,5-hexadiene were identified by GC-MS. The degradation metabolic pathway was predicted by the intermediates by GC-MS, and PathPred based analysis.

AB Antibacterial residues in the natural environment have been of increasing concern due to their impact on bacteria resistance development and toxicity to natural communities and ultimately to public health. China is a large country with high production and consumption of antibacterials for its population growth and economic development in recent years. In this article, we summarized the current situation of human-use antibacterial pollution in Chinese water (wastewaters, natural and drinking waters) and solid matrices (sludge, sediment, and soil) reported in 33 peer-reviewed papers. We found that, although there are adequate wastewater treatment systems in China, human-use antibacterial residues in the natural environment were reported almost throughout the whole country. Three most frequently prescribed classes of antibacterials in China, including quinolones, macrolides, and beta-lactam, were also the predominant classes of residues in Chinese environment, manifested as the high concentration and detection frequency. In view of this alarming situation, we have presented that ecopharmacovigilance (EPV) might be implemented in the antibacterial drug administration of China, as the active participation of the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory authorities from the diffuse source of antibacterial pollution. Considering EPV experience of developed countries together with the actual conditions of China, we have identified some approaches that can be taken, including:
   . Focus on education;
   . Further strengthening and persevering the antibacterial stewardship strategies and pharmaceutical take-back programs in China;
   . Designing greener antibacterials with better degradability in the environment;
   . Implementing environmental risk assessment prior to launch of new drugs;
   . Strengthening collaboration in EPV-related areas.

AB Fathead minnows were exposed for a life cycle to environmentally relevant concentrations of a mixture of six common pharmaceuticals and one personal care product (nominal concentrations: 1,000, 300, 100, 30, or 10 ng/L). Mean measured concentrations of each chemical in the highest fish exposure aquaria were: naproxen 793 ng/L, gemfibrozil 662 ng/L, diclofenac 331 ng/L, ibuprophen 217 ng/L, triclosan 115 ng/L, salicylic acid 67 ng/L, and acetaminophen (chemical analysis inconclusive, nominal 1000 ng/L). Fish exposed for a life cycle even to the highest concentrations of the six pharmaceuticals and personal care product (PPCP) mixture showed no significant changes in growth and development compared to control. Length, weights, condition factors, liver weights, and gonad weights of PPCP-exposed fish were similar to water and solvent controls (0.000005% ethanol v/v). There were no marked effects of PPCP mixture exposure on external sex characteristics of the fish or on egg production. The only parameter that appeared to be affected was percent larval deformities in F1, which showed a significant increase in the 100- and 300-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture. Larvae from control fish had 4.7% (water controls) and 3.4% (solvent controls) deformities, compared to 9.3% in the 100-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture and 9.2% deformities in the 300-ng/L (nominal) PPCP mixture. Chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of seven PPCP most often detected in Canadian municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE) did not appear to affect fathead minnow survival, growth, or egg production, although it produced quantitative increases in deformities in the F1 generation.

AB Passive and composite sampling in combination with in vitro bioassays and identification and quantification of individual chemicals were applied to characterize pollution by compounds with several specific modes of action in urban area in the basin of two rivers, with 400,000 inhabitants and a variety of industrial activities. Two types of passive samplers, semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD) for hydrophobic contaminants and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) for polar compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, were used to sample wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent as well as rivers upstream and downstream of the urban complex and the WWTP. Compounds with endocrine disruptive potency were detected in river water and WWTP influent and effluent. Year-round, monthly assessment of waste waters by bioassays documented estrogenic, androgenic and dioxin-like potency as well as cytotoxicity in influent waters of the WWTP and allowed characterization of seasonal variability of these biological potentials in waste waters. The WWTP effectively removed cytotoxic compounds, xenoestrogens and xenoandrogens. There was significant variability in treatment efficiency of dioxin-like potency. The study indicates that the WWTP, despite its up-to-date technology, can contribute endocrine disrupting compounds to the river. Riverine samples exhibited dioxin-like, antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic potencies. The study design enabled characterization of effects of the urban complex and the WWTP on the river. Concentrations of PAHs and contaminants and specific biological potencies sampled by POCIS decreased as a function of distance from the city. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fate and effects of cytostatic (anticancer or antineoplastic) pharmaceuticals in the environment are largely unknown, but they can contaminate wastewater treatment effluents and consequently aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we have focused on five cytostatic compounds used in high amounts (cyclophosphamide. cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and etoposide), and we have investigated their ecotoxicity in bacterial Pseudomonas putida growth-inhibition test, algal Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth-inhibition test, and Dapnia magna acute immobilization test. Genotoxicity also was assessed with Escherichiel coli SOS-chromotest (with and without metabolic activation) and the GreenScreen Assay using yeast S. eerevisiae. All tested compounds showed significant effects in most of the assays with lowest-observed-effect concentrations and concentrations causing 50% effects (EC50s) values ranging within mu g/L to mg/L. The most toxic compound was 5-fluorouracil in the assays with P. putida (EC50 = 0.027 mg/L) and P. subcapitata (EC50 0.11 mg/L), although cisplatin and doxorubicin were the most toxic to D, magna (EC50 = 0.64 and 2.0 mg/L, respectively). These two chemicals were also the most genotoxic in the SOS-chromotest (minimum genotoxic concentrations [MGC] = 0.07-0.2 mg/L), and 5-fluorouracil was the most genotoxic in the eukaryotic yeast assay (MGC = 0.02 mg/L). Our investigation seems to indicate generally lower risks of acute effects at concentrations expected in the environment. However, some effective concentrations were relatively low and chronic toxicity of cytostatics (and/or their transformation products), as well as specific sources of human pharmaceuticals such as hospital effluents, require research attention.

AB The disposal of microfine marble sawdust contained in marble slurry waste, currently represents an additional economic burden for dimension stones companies. This is because the sawdust is considered less important in comparison with the crushed calcareous aggregate produced in stone processing plants. In addition, the sludge is mistakenly viewed as waste that has to be disposed of in landfill. State of the art in recovery and utilisation of calcareous sawdust is mainly aimed in uses as substitute for more expensive ingredient in the building sector. Moreover limestone dust, recovered from marble sawing and processing slurry, has not yet found real economically feasible industrial usage. Due to the high market value of micronised CaCO3, we study the use of limestone sawdust as functional filler in industrial products having higher added value, such as paper, rubber, paints, pharmaceuticals. Standard requirements of CaCO3 for this kind of products are very tight, especially those relating to purity level, particle size distribution and brightness. The high Calcium limestone deposit and the factories in Orosei Marble producing area (Sardinia, Italy) allow the production of high quality microfine dust. To evaluate the properties of the sawdust, several analysis were carried out to compare the results with the standard requirements of CaCO3 for paper, rubber and tyre production. The assessment concerns five different factories and it highlights the possible usage of the sawdust produced in Orosei by carrying out simple and inexpensive changes in both stone-working process and wastewater treatment. Finally, a commentary on environmental laws pertaining to the recycle of this kind of waste is also made in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fibrates are a class of pharmaceuticals that indirectly modulate cholesterol biosynthesis through effects on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that has been detected in wastewater treatment plant influents, effluents, and drinking water. The objective of the present study was to assess the potential physiological and reproductive impacts of gemfibrozil on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were exposed to gemfibrozil in two different studies. The first was a short-term test with water concentrations of 0, 15, and 600 mu g gemfibrozil/L, sampling after 2 or 8 d of exposure. Plasma cholesterol concentrations were significantly reduced in males exposed to 600 mu g gemfibrozil/L for 8 d. In addition, expression of several hepatic genes important to lipid metabolism was altered, suggesting that gemfibrozil does affect lipid metabolism in fish. A 21-d study was conducted to investigate further the effects on lipid metabolism and steroidogenesis as well as to assess potential impacts of gemfibrozil on reproduction. Fish were exposed to water concentrations of 0, 1.5, 15, 600, and 1,500 mu g gemfibrozil/L. Exposure to 1,500 mu g gemfibrozil/L caused a modest, but not significant, reduction in fecundity. However, gemfibrozil had no consistent effect on plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, or sex steroids after 21 d of exposure. The present study showed no evidence for significant physiological or reproductive impacts of gemfibrozil at an environmentally relevant concentration of 1.5 mu g/L. Environ. Toxicol.

AB The amount and distribution of six pharmaceutical compounds belonging to distinct therapeutic classes were investigated along the navigation channel of the Douro River estuary. Distinct spatial and temporal trends were considered and a total of 87 water samples were pre-concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an ion trap (IT) analyzer and electrospray ionization (ESI). The maximum concentrations found were 178 ng/L for carbamazepine, 3.65 ng/L for diazepam, 70.3 ng/L for fenofibric acid, 3.18 ng/L for propranolol, 15.7 ng/L for trimethoprim and 53.3 ng/L for sulfamethoxazole. Carbamazepine was the most ubiquitous compound with 100% positive detection frequency followed by propranolol (38%), trimethoprim (34%) and sulfamethoxazole (33%). The pharmaceutical compounds were quantified at higher levels in the lower stretch of the estuary, especially near the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The data proves that pollution of the Douro River estuary by pharmaceuticals is consistent and is occurring in a fairly constant manner in time, covering a wide area and displaying hot-spots. Individually, the concentration levels are not likely to cause acute effects, based on reference experimental data. However, the fact that complex mixtures exist gives cause for concern as regards potentially relevant toxicological risks. The study points out the need for continuous monitoring of contamination levels not only in the Douro River estuary but also in other major estuaries. Finally, the scenario supports the need for experimental studies on toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the effects of carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen on the behavior of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system treating urban wastewater that was doped continuously with three different concentrations of this mix of pharmaceuticals under a hydraulic retention time of 6h.
   RESULTS: The degradation capacity of these chemicals and the heterotrophic kinetics regarding the organic matter removal were evaluated in the control and doping cycles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the MLSS decreased drastically, these differences were not observed in the organic matter removal as the increase of cell growth rate cancelled out the increase in cell decay rate due to the chemical stress caused by the addition of pharmaceuticals, as shown by the increased organic matter degradation rate from 86.27 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) in the control cycle to values within the limits 183.97 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) and 192.88 mgO(2) L-1 h(-1) in doping cycles. The degradation rates were 0.0154, 0.0152 and 0.0160 mu gS/((mu gS(in)/L)*h*mgMLSS) for carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen, respectively, involving removal yields higher than 71.9, 88.7 and 94.7% for carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen, respectively, at the three different concentrations tested. Therefore, MBR technology can be used as a reliable process to significantly reduce this mix of pharmaceuticals without reducing its organic matter removal capacity.

AB Increasing concern about the fate of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in the environment stimulates the search for alternative methods for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent polishing. The aim of this study was to establish an innovative and effective biological removal technique for EE2 by means of a nitrifier enrichment culture (NEC) applied in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). In batch incubation tests, the microbial consortium was able to remove EE2 from both a synthetic minimal medium and WWTP effluent. A maximum EE2 removal rate of 9.0 mu g EE2 g(-1) biomass-VSS h(-1) was achieved (>94% removal efficiency). incubation of the heterotrophic bacteria isolated from the NEC did not result in a significant EE2 removal, indicating the importance of nitrification as driving force in the mechanism. Application of the NEC in a MBR to treat a synthetic influent with an EE2 concentration of 83 ng EE2 L-1 resulted in a removal efficiency of 99% (loading rates up to 208 ng EE2 L-1 d(-1); membrane flux rate: 6.9 L m(-2) h(-1)). Simultaneously, complete nitrification was achieved at an optimal ammonium influent concentration of 1.0 mg NH4+-N L-1. This minimal NH4+-N input is very advantageous for effluent polishing since the concomitant effluent nitrate concentrations will be low as well and it offers opportunities for the nitrifying MBR as a promising add-on technology for WWTP effluent polishing.

AB Naproxen (NPX), one of the best-selling nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is found in surface and drinking water at concentrations up to 1 mu g dm(-3). It has been emerging as a water contaminant during the last two decades. Conventional removal techniques, i. e. sewage treatment, membrane separation, filtration, and adsorption have been found to be inefficient for complete removal of NPX. Intensification of the wastewater treatment processes is important in order to achieve higher degradation efficiencies. Advanced oxidation processes (i. e. ozonation, photolysis, and photo-Fenton) have the greater capability of NPX removal. In the present study, a combination of ozonated microbubbles and H2O2 was used for effective removal of NPX. The use of microbubbles increased the mass transfer into the aqueous phase. Use of H2O2 with ozone increased the degradation process significantly, which confirms the-the hydroxyl radicals generated in situ under the alkaline conditions. The ozone supply rates were 0.39, 0.41, 0.44, and 0.48 mg s(-1) and the corresponding reaction times were 10000, 2400, 840, and 240 s, respectively for 98-99% conversion for pH 9. The pseudo first-order reaction constants or O-3 alone and H2O2 + O-3 were in the range of 2.89x10(-3)-6.44x10(-3) and 3.39x10(-3) 13.6x10(-3) min(-1), respectively. The effects of ozone supply rate and pH of the reaction system were also studied. The by-products were identified and a mechanism of ozonation of NPX was proposed. The main intermediates were 2-methoxy-6-ethyl naphthalene, (2-methoxy-6-methyl naphthalene, and 1-(6-methoxynaphtalen- 2-yl) ethyl-hydroperoxide.

AB This study examined the impact of soil filtration on water quality for reclaimed water from two municipal wastewater treatment processes with two soils (forest and farm). Soils were watered for 16 wk. Nutrients (NO3-N, NH3-N, and PO4-3), electrical conductivity, hardness, pH, total metals, and estrogenic activity in source and effluents were measured. Results were evaluated in reference to current regulations in Washington State. Both reclaimed waters met standards for unrestricted agricultural use but did not meet current state regulations for ecological use. Metal concentrations in reclaimed waters were generally similar to the control (tap water). Both source and soil filtered water met Washington State stream water criteria for chronic exposure for As but exceeded groundwater standards. Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ag, and Zn in the effluents were similar or slightly elevated to reclaimed source water for both soils and water types. Soil filtration improved water quality to levels within Washington State regulatory limits for ecological use for Cd, Cu, and Zn but decreased water quality for Pb for both soil and reclaimed water types. Phosphate concentrations were reduced by soil filtration, but NO3- concentrations were increased for both soils and all water types above source water concentrations. The estrogenic activity of the sand-filtered water decreased to near detection limits in the forest soil and by > 200% in the farm soil. The degradation in water quality (increased NO3-, As, and Mn) after soil filtration observed in this study would likely occur with any water type, including rainwater.

AB This case study presents the fate of selected organic, priority and emerging pollutants along a 3.6 km sector of a vegetated, agricultural ditch situated in Sinaloa (Mexico). The ditch receives runoff of agriculture and domestic wastewater from an adjacent community. During 2013, the occurrence of 38 organic pollutants (pesticides, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), artificial sweeteners and pharmaceutical residues) was monitored monthly at five selected points in the ditch water. Additionally, sediment and Typha domingensis (cattail) plants were collected in March, June, and September 2013 and investigated concerning their ability to absorb and accumulate pollutants. The concentrations of the selected pollutants in the ditch water ranged from sub ng L-1 (metolachlor, atrazine) tow (metalaxyl, acesulfame). The metabolites endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan lactone exceeded mostly the concentration of the precursor insecticide endosulfan. Sorption on sediments was of minor relevance for accumulation of pollutants in the ditch system. Concentrations in the sediments varied seasonally and ranged from 0.2 to 12,432 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.). T. domingensis accumulated ten of the studied pollutants mainly in roots (5-1065 lig kg(-1) d.w.). Overall, the monitoring results of the ditch compartments indicated that downstream the concentrations of the target pollutants decreased. Under no -flow conditions in the hot season, the ditch revealed a noticeable potential to mitigate pollutants. Among the high microbial activity in the water and the subtropical climate conditions, the ditch vegetation contributed to natural attenuation of the selected pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The recent emergence of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) in the aquatic environment emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways during rodent control. Pest control in municipal sewer systems of urban and suburban areas is thought to be an important emission pathway for AR to reach wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), respectively. To circumstantiate that AR will enter streams via effluent discharges and bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms despite very low predicted environmental emissions, we conducted a retrospective biological monitoring of fish tissue samples from different WWTP fish monitoring ponds exclusively fed by municipal effluents in Bavaria, Germany. At the same time, information about rodent control in associated sewer systems was collected by telephone survey to assess relationships between sewer baiting and rodenticide residues in fish. In addition, mussel and fish tissue samples from several Bavarian surface waters with different effluent impact were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of anticoagulants in indigenous aquatic organisms.
   Hepatic AR residues were detected at 12 out of 25 WWTP sampling sites in the low mu g/kg range, thereof six sites with one or more second-generation AR (i.e., brodifacoum, difenacoum, bromadiolone). 14 of 18 surveyed sites confirmed sewer baiting with AR and detected hepatic residues matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sites. Furthermore, second-generation AR were detected in more than 80% of fish liver samples from investigated Bavarian streams. Highest total hepatic AR concentrations in these fish were 9.1 and 8.5 mu g/kg wet weight, respectively and were observed at two riverine sampling sites characterized by close proximity to upstream WWTP outfalls. No anticoagulant residues were found in fish liver samples from two lakes without known influences of effluent discharges.
   The findings of our study clearly show incomplete removal of anticoagulants during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm exposure of aquatic organisms via municipal effluents. Based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic AR residues in effluent-exposed fish, sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into the aquatic environment.

AB In this study the occurrence of diclofenac and sub-products in effluent emerging from the University Hospital at the Federal University of Santa Maria was investigated. One metabolite was identified and, in aqueous solution, three degradation products. The quantification was conducted by means of HPLC-DAD, and the determination of metabolite and degradation products by LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap. For the HPLC-DAD method, a 70: 30 mixture of methanol/sodium phosphate was used in isocratic mode. For the LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap determinations, a mobile phase, where phase A was an ammonium acetate solution 5 x 10(-3) mol L-1, and phase B was methanol (5 x 10(-3) mol L-1)/ammonium acetate (9:1, v/v), on gradient mode. The LDs for the HPLC and LC-MS/MS methods, respectively, were 2.5 and 0.02 mu g L-1, the LQs, 8.3 and 0.05 mu g L-1, and the linear range from 10 up to 2000 mu g L-1 and 0.05 up to 10 mu g L-1. As expected, the LC-ESI-MS/MS-QTrap method was more sensitive and less laborious. The metabolite 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac was identified. Photolysis was used for the degradation studies and three products of diclofenac were identified (m/z of 214, 286 and 303) in aqueous solution. These results notwithstanding, no degradation products of diclofenac were found in the hospital effluent.

AB This study aims to assess the removal of a set of non-polar pollutants in biologically treated wastewater using ozonation, ultraviolet (UV 254 nm low pressure mercury lamp) and visible light (Xe-arc lamp) irradiation as well as visible light photocatalysis using Ce-doped TiO2. The compounds tracked include UV filters, synthetic musks, herbicides, insecticides, antiseptics and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Raw wastewater and treated samples were analyzed using stir-bar sorptive extraction coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (SBSE-CG x GC-TOF-MS). Ozone treatment could remove most pollutants with a global efficiency of over 95% for 209 mu M ozone dosage. UV irradiation reduced the total concentration of the sixteen pollutants tested by an average of 63% with high removal of the sunscreen 2-ethylhexyl trans-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), the synthetic musk 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene (tonalide, AHTN) and several herbicides. Visible light Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis reached similar to 70% overall removal with particularly high efficiency for synthetic musks. In terms of power usage efficiency expressed as nmol kJ(-1), the results showed that ozonation was by far the most efficient process, ten-fold over Xe/Ce-TiO2 visible light photocatalysis, the latter being in turn considerably more efficient than UV irradiation. In all cases the efficiency decreased along the treatments due to the lower reaction rate at lower pollutant concentration. The use of photocatalysis greatly improved the efficiency of visible light irradiation. The collector area per order decreased from 9.14 +/- 5.11 m(2)m(-3) order(-1) for visible light irradiation to 0.16 +/- 0.03 m(2) m(-3) order(-1) for Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis. The toxicity of treated wastewater was assessed using the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Ozonation reduced the toxicity of treated wastewater, while UV irradiation and visible light photocatalysis limited by 20-25% the algal growth due to the accumulation of reaction byproducts. Three transformation products were identified and tracked along the treatments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An assessment of the steroid estrogen removing performance of 23 different sewage treatment plants (STPs) was performed. The assessment relied on a model to estimate influent concentrations, and completed questionnaires on the STP treatment details from the relevant water companies. This information was compared with observed effluent 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) concentrations. The 10 biological filter plants (BFP) in the study performed poorly with only 30% (SD 31) removal on average for El. This reduced El removal performance of the BFPs compared to all the other STP types in the survey was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Scenarios of all the STPs as activated sludge types, and one as all BFP types were modelled using the GREAT-ER model set up for the Aire/Calder catchment in the UK. This difference was shown to have an important effect on predicted river El concentrations and consequent risk classifications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEGRADATION
AB Pharmaceutical products, particularly antibiotics, due to their cumulative characteristics, undesirable effects and creating drug resistances, as inevitably pollutants, poses a major concern in environmental issues. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been considerably used for degradation of new and emerging pollutants such as residual medications and resistant compounds in water and wastewater. Present investigation evaluates the removal of metronidazole from aqueous solution by electro coagulation and photoelectrophenton processes. The data will be informative for environmental agencies, pharmaceutical companies and wastewater treatment companies for choosing it as a practical oxidation advance process for treatment of water polluted by resistant material (drugs and pesticides).

AB Biosolids from wastewater treatment plants is a crucial channel for the transfer of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) from wastewaters to the soil, which necessitates the treatment of the biosolids prior to any application. The present study evaluated the effect of four different pre-treatment strategies on biosolids valorization and the subsequent removal of TrOCs during bioaugmentation with Bacillus subtilis. On analyzing the biosolids, out of the 72 TrOCs investigated, eight pharmaceuticals (total concentration of 157.2 +/- 43.4 mu g/kg), and two pesticides (total concentration of 18.8 +/- 5.8 mu g/kg) were detected. It was observed that when the biosolids was augmented with B. subtilis for 28 days, 52% TrOCs removal with a total suspended solids (TSS) reduction of 12% was achieved. In order to enhance the effect of aerobic digestion, four different pre-treatment strategies - alkali, ultrasonication, freeze-drying and enzymatic, were employed for biosolids management. Among these strategies, alkali pre-treatment showed the maximum TrOCs removal of 63% with 8% reduction in TSS, followed by ultrasonication, where the TrOCs removal was 32% with 5% TSS reduction. On comparing the combinational effect, the aerobic digestion of enzyme pre-treated biosolids showed an enhanced TrOCs removal of 90%, which also incurred TSS reduction of 18%, followed by the alkaline treated, freeze-dried and ultrasonicated biosolids. Thus, this study establishes B. subtilis aided aerobic digestion as an effective process for biosolids treatment and explains the impact of pre-treatment processes on TrOCs and TSS removal.

AB The continued emergence of bacterial pathogens presenting antimicrobial resistance is widely recognised as a global health threat and recent attention focused on potential environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Freshwater environments such as rivers represent a potential hotspot for ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are receiving systems for effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Effluent also contains low levels of different antimicrobials including antibiotics and biocides. Sulfonamides are antibacterial chemicals widely used in clinical, veterinary and agricultural settings and are frequently detected in sewage sludge and manure in addition to riverine ecosystems. The impact of such exposure on ARG prevalence and diversity is unknown, so the aim of this study was to investigate the release of a sublethal concentration of the sulfonamide compound sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on the river bacterial microbiome using a flume system. This system was a semi-natural in vitro flume using river water (30 L) and sediment (6 kg) with circulation to mimic river flow. A combination of 'omics' approaches were conducted to study the impact of SMX exposure on the microbiomes within the flumes. Metagenomic analysis showed that the addition of low concentrations of SMX (<4 mu g L-1) had a limited effect on the bacterial resistome in the water fraction only, with no impact observed in the sediment. Metaproteomics did not show differences in ARGs expression with SMX exposure in water. Overall, the river bacterial community was resilient to short term exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of SMX which mimics the exposure such communities experience downstream of WWTPs throughout the year.

AB The present study investigates the efficiency of electrospun montmorillonite-impregnated cellulose acetate nanofiber membranes (MMT-CA-NFM) for adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin (CIP). Surface morphology, nano fiber characteristics and pHzpc of NFM were analysed by FE-SEM, EDS and pH drift method, respectively. The surface morphology of NFM showed random arrangements of nanofiber. Experiments were performed in batch mode to examine the effect of contact time, adsorbent dose, initial CIP concentration, pH, electrolyte, temperature and agitation speed. It was observed that 60 min contact was sufficient to reach reaction equilibrium and corresponding percentage removal was 76 % when CIP concentration, MMT-CA-NFM dose and solution pH were 10 mg/L, 4 g/L and 6.0 respectively. Equilibrium of the adsorption was described well by both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The sorption capacity was determined to be 13.8 mg/g. The sorption most closely followed Elovich kinetics model among the models tested. The pH range 6-7.5, where the zwitter ionic nature of CIP was dominant, was found to be most favourable for adsorption. Decrease of Delta G with increase in temperature demonstrated that CIP removal was favourable at higher temperature and positive values of Delta H confirmed endothermic nature of reaction. In continuous mode of operation using fixed bed column, the height of mass transfer zone was found to be 14.96 cm and adsorption rate and capacity constant in continuous mode were also calculated. The regeneration experiments indicated that 10 mM NaOH solution can desorb CIP from exhausted NFM and adsorbent demonstrated good reusability for removal of the antibiotic studied.

AB Nimesulide (Nim) degradation in ultrapure water (UW) and municipal sewage (MS) via UV-ABC/H2O2 was investigated. The variables included in the experimental design were time, initial Nim, and initial H2O2 concentrations. Resulting decreases in Nim concentration (monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a photodiode array detector operating at a maximum UV absorbance of 300 nm), mineralization (from total organic carbon (TOC) measurements), and ecotoxicity (assays employing the bioindicators Daphnia similis, Artemia salina, and Allium cepa) were also studied. Degradation rates of 90% or higher were found for 15-20 min reaction times, employing combinations of [H2O2] = 50-150 mgL(-1) and [Nim] = 8.5-15 mg L-1 prepared with MS. Mineralization rates of 70% and higher were attained within 60 min of reaction for [Nim] = 15 mg L-1 prepared in MS with [H2O2] = 100mgL(-1). Nim by-products were detected and possible degradation pathways proposed. Ecotoxicity evaluation using A. salina, D. similis, and A. cepa revealed that the treated samples had significantly lower toxicity. Exposure to treated samples resulted in survival rates of 79% for A. salina and over 90% for D. similis. No root growth inhibition was observed in A. cepa exposed to treated samples, whereas exposure to untreated samples inhibited root growth by 60%. Statistical analysis revealed elimination of cytotoxicity and reduction of genotoxicity against A. cepa. The results showed that the UV-ABC/H2O2 process can be employed as a pre- or post-treatment method to remove Nim from contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals discharged in municipal wastewater are of emerging concern because of their potential for inducing biological effects in aquatic organisms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat chronic depression, have been detected in receiving and wastewaters. Fluoxetine is a highly prescribed model SSRI used to assess impacts of antidepressants on aquatic organisms. In this study, in vitro hepatic fluoxetine metabolism was determined in several model fish species: rainbow trout, goldfish, zebrafish and killifish. Incubation of fluoxetine with hepatic microsomes from trout pre-treated with carbamazepine showed a time-dependant loss of fluoxetine, concomitant with an increase in norfluoxetine, the major mammalian demethylated metabolite. However, fluoxetine was not well metabolized in reactions with hepatic microsomes from untreated fish. Fluoxetine loss was greater than norfluoxetine production, indicating that norfluoxetine is not the predominant fluoxetine biotransformation product in fish. Furthermore, norfluoxetine was often undetected, possibly indicating that fluoxetine demethylation is a minor metabolic pathway in fish. Inter-species differences in fluoxetine metabolism were not evident because of high intra-species variability, although killifish appeared to have the highest hepatic metabolic capacity for fluoxetine. Fluoxetine metabolism in mammals is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Trout were exposed to known CYP inducers, carbamazepine and 3-methylcholanthrene, to assess potential induction of hepatic fluoxetine metabolism. Microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene treated fish did not induce detectable changes in fluoxetine concentrations in vitro, indicating that fish CYP1s are not involved in fluoxetine metabolism; the CYPs involved are still unclear. Identification of metabolites other than norfluoxetine warrants further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging ozone-based advanced oxidation process (AOP) that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement in water treatment. To evaluate its performance under more realistic conditions of water treatment, a continuous-flow pilot E-peroxone system was developed and compared with conventional ozonation and a UV/O-3 process for micropollutant abatements in various water matrices (groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent) in this study. With a specific ozone dose of 1.5 mg o(3)/mg DOC, micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with ozone (O-3) (diclofenac, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate) could be sufficiently abated (>90% abatement) in the various waters by all three processes. However, ozoneresistant micropollutants (ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and chloramphenicol) were abated only by similar to 32 -68%, 68-91%, and 73-90% during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. By electro-generating H2O2 or applying UV irradiation to enhance o(3) transformation to center dot OH during ozonation, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant micropollutants by similar to 15-43%, similar to 5-15%, and similar to 5 -10% in the groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. In addition, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. Due to its higher efficiency, the E-peroxone process reduced similar to 10-53% of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol (the most ozone-resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters) by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, the UV/O-3 process consumed approximately 4 -10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation. This pilot-scale study demonstrates that the E-peroxone process can provide a feasible, effective, and energy-efficient alternative for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water and wastewater treatment.

AB The source apportionment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the water environment based on indicators (i-PPCPs) requires a comprehensive characterization of various emission sources using reliable analytical methods for a wide spectrum of PPCPs. In this study, a robust and sensitive method based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for analyzing 70 PPCPs belonging to 17 therapeutic classes in landfill leachates and livestock wastewaters was developed. The SPE cartridges, sample pH, elution solvents and chelating agent additions were optimized, and acceptable recoveries (60-130% for 67 target compounds), low method quantification limits (landfill leachate: 3-1309 ng/L; livestock wastewater: 3-686 ng/L) and high precisions (repeatability: 0-20% for over 99% injections; reproducibility: 0-20% for over 90% injections) were obtained. Using the optimized analytical method to characterize PPCPs in the typical landfill leachate and livestock wastewater in Yangtze River Delta, China, we found anthelmintics, which were first reported in landfill leachates globally, exhibited the highest concentration (albendazole, maximum concentration of 61.6 mu g/L), and therefore proposed albendazole as one of the promising i-PPCP candidates in landfill leachates. In livestock wastewaters, antibiotics lincomycin was the most abundant PPCP (maximum concentration: 735 mu g/L) and identified as an i-PPCP candidate for livestock-originated contamination. In addition, 15 non-antibiotic PPCPs were first investigated in the livestock wastewater in China and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, diclofenac and naproxen, were detected at similar concentration level (1.16-91.1 mu g/L) to antibiotics, highlighting the necessity to include representative non-antibiotic PPCPs in the studies of emerging contaminants in livestock wastewaters. The developed method provides a tool to comprehensively investigate PPCPs in high-strength wastewater, and the preliminary findings in the characterization of typical landfill leachates and livestock wastewaters are helpful to select i-PPCPs for the source apportionment of PPCPs in Yangtze River Delta, China.

AB The application of sonolysis (US) for remediation of wastewater is an area of increasing interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonic (US) process on the degradation of pharmaceuticals (diclofenac (DCF), amoxicillin (AMX), carbamazepine (CBZ)) in single solutions and also in three mixtures spiked in urban wastewater effluent. Several operating conditions, such as power density (25-100 W L-1), initial substrate concentrations (2.5-10 mg L-1), initial solution pH (3-11), and air sparging were varied for the evaluation and understanding of the process. The degradation (as assessed by measuring UV absorbance), the generation of hydroxyl radicals (as assessed measuring H2O2 concentration), the mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), and the aerobic biodegradability (as assessed by the BOD5/COD ratio) were monitored during sonication. Ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lepidium sativum before and after treatment was also evaluated.
   It was found that the pharmaceuticals conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air. The reaction rate increases with increasing initial concentration of single pharmaceuticals but it remains constant in the mixtures, indicating different kinetic regimes (i.e. first and zero order respectively). Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than pharmaceuticals to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable. The toxicity of the wastewater samples before and after contamination with pharmaceuticals both in mixtures and in single substance-containing solutions was observed more severely on P. subcapitata; a fact that raises concerns in regards to the discharge of such effluents. D. magna displayed less sensitivity compared to P. subcapitata because it belongs in a lower taxonomic species than D. magna. The germination index of L. sativum in the presence of the drugs' mixture was stimulated instead of inducing any toxicity effect and this might be attributed to the fact the sample, laden with very low drug concentrations was able to act as a provider of additional nutrient elements.

AB Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharge micropollutants like pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products or endocrine disrupting chemicals but also nutrients. Both can adversely influence the freshwater ecosystem and may finally affect the ecological conditions. Many studies focus on the potential impact of large WWTPs even if smaller ones are more common, often less efficient and discharge into small creeks or the upper reaches of rivers. As a result, the receiving waters are characterized by relatively high shares of treated wastewater. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the ecotoxicological effects of a small WWTP on freshwater amphipods and mollusks in a small creek using an active and passive monitoring approach, accompanied by laboratory experiments (LE). In vitro assays with recombinant yeasts and the microtox assay with Aliivibrio fischeri were performed in parallel to determine the endocrine potential and the baseline toxicity. The evaluation of the effects of the analysed WWTP was possible due to its shutdown during our study and the application of the same in vivo and in vitro assays before and after the shutdown. During the operation of the WWTP the discharge of treated wastewater caused significantly higher mortalities and lower reproduction of the anaylsed invertebrates in the active and passive montoring as well as in the LEs. Furthermore, the amphipod species assemblage in the creek was affected downstream of the WWTP effluent. Besides, the endocrine activity and baseline toxicity were significantly higher downstream of the effluent. After the shutdown of the WWTP, the in vitro activity levels and adverse in vivo effects in the receiving water recovered quickly with no significant differences downstream of the former WWTP effluent compared to the upstream station. Furthermore, the previously disturbed amphipod species assemblage recovered significantly with a shift in favor of Gammarus fossarum downstream of the effluent. These biological results are consistent with a marked decline by 81.5% for the detected micropollutants in the receiving creek after the shutdown which points to a prominent role of micropollutants for the observed effects.

AB The unchecked production and use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) for the treatment of infections in human and livestock has increased in Pakistan, which resulted in large amount of antibiotics in water bodies. In the current study, the prevalence and associated ecological risk of three FQs were investigated in wastewater bodies and sludge samples of Kahuta and Hattar industrial zones. The average concentrations of ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR) and levofloxacin (LEV) in the waste-water samples were slightly higher in Kahuta (i.e. 58, 32.9, and 36.7 mu g L-1 respectively), than those in Hattar sites (i.e. 42.1, 41.2, and 48.9 mu g L-1 respectively). However, the concentrations of CIP, ENR and LEV in the sludge samples were significantly higher (i.e. 159; 153 and 164 mu g kg(-1) respectively) in Hattar sites, compared to those in Kahuta sites (i.e. 129, 58 and 91 mu g kg(-1) respectively). The uses of FQs in the health sector resulted in water pollution and poses the ecological risk to aquatic organisms. The individual risk associated with CIP was highest in Kahuta industrial sites for green algae ranging (2900-9100) followed by M. aeruginosa (5800-18200), cyanobacteria (580-18204) and invertebrates (24.2-75.8). These values suggested that the prevalence of antibiotics in the waste-disposal sites could be potential risk for the aquatic ecosystem, and harmful to biodiversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The removal of pharmaceutically active compounds by powdered activated carbon (PAC) in municipal wastewater is a promising solution to the problem of polluted recipient waters. Today, an efficient design strategy is however lacking with regard to high-level overall, and specific, substance removal in the large scale. The performance of PAC-based removal of pharmaceuticals was studied in pilot-scale with respect to the critical parameters; contact time and PAC dose using one PAC product selected by screening in bench-scale. The goal was a minimum of 95% removal of the pharmaceuticals present in the evaluated municipal wastewater. A set of 21 pharmaceuticals was selected from an initial 100 due to their high occurrence in the effluent water of two selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Sweden, whereof candidates discussed for future EU regulation directives were included. By using recirculation of PAC over a treatment system using three sequential contact tanks, a combination of the benefits of powdered and granular carbon performance was achieved. The treatment system was designed so that recirculation could be introduced to any of the three tanks to investigate the effect of recirculation on the adsorption performance. This was compared to use of the setup, but without recirculation. A higher degree of pharmaceutical removal was achieved in all recirculation setups, both overall and with respect to specific substances, as compared to without recirculation. Recirculation was tested with nominal contact times of 30, 60 and 120 min and the goal of 95% removal could be achieved already at the shortest contact times at a PAC dose of 10-15 mg/L. In particular, the overall removal could be increased even to 97% and 99%, at 60 and 120 min, respectively, when the recirculation point was the first tank. Recirculation of PAC to either the first or the second contact tank proved to be comparable, while a slightly lower performance was observed with recirculation to the third tank. With regards to individual substances, clarithromycin and diclofenac were ubiquitously removed according to the set goal and in contrast, a few substances (fluconazole, irbesartan, memantine and venlafaxine) required specific settings to reach an acceptable removal.

AB Persulfate-based advanced oxidation process is a powerful countermeasure for water remediation, where effective and low-cost catalysts are still needed. Herein, a one-pot synthetic method for magnetic nitrogen-doped sludge biochar (MS-biochar) was presented, which exhibited better catalytic property with PDS for tetracycline degradation than typical graphitic carbon (graphite powder, graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes) and two other types biochars. EDAX manifested the uniform dispersion of elements in MS-biochar. Similar to "top-down", a research thought from whole to part of MS-biochar for contribution measurement was presented, where acid-soluble substance (ASS) was the most important contributor for MS-400/600 while carbon matrix (CM) was dominant for MS-800. Quenching and EPR demonstrated a free-radicals pathway in MS-biochar/PDS, where ASS mainly assumed to be effective for SO4 center dot- and CM was primarily committed to center dot OH generation. EDAX, XPS and Raman studies proved three kinds of catalytic sites, namely the iron compounds, doped nitrogen and graphitic carbon. And their activating mechanism were discussed where one internal electron migration path (from sp(3) to nanocrystalline sp(2) carbon) has been first proposed. Reusability, metal leaching detection and pharmaceutical wastewater application indicated the potential of MS-biochar. This work not only presents a potential resource-based disposal of sewage sludge, a novel research thought from whole to part for materials performance measurement, but also provides guidance for carbon materials' design for persulfate activation, especially for sp(2) and sp(3) co-hybridized carbons.

AB The use of chemotherapy agents has been growing worldwide, due to the increase number of cancer cases. In several countries, mainly in Europe countries, these drugs have been detected in hospitals and municipal wastewaters. In Brazil this issue is poorly explored. The main goal of this study was to assess the presence of three anti-cancer drugs, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine (GEM) and cyclophosphamide (CP), and two metabolites, alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (3-NH2-F) and 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (2-DOH-DiF), in effluents from a large cancer hospital, in the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent, and also to evaluate toxicity of the mixtures of these compounds by ecotoxicological testing in zebrafish. The sample collections were performed in Barretos Cancer Hospital of the large cancer center in Brazil. After each collection, the samples were filtered for subsequent Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis. The presence of CP, GEM, and both metabolites (3-NH2-F and 2-DOH-DiF) were detected in the hospital wastewater and the WWTP influent. Three drugs, GEM, 2-DOH-DiF and CP, were detected in the WWTP effluent. Two drugs were detected below the limit of quantification, 2-DOH-DiF: <LOQ (above 1400 ng L-1) and CP: <LOQ (above 300 ng L-1), and GEM was quantified at 420 ng L-1. Furthermore, 2-DOH-DiF (116,000 ng L-1) was detected at the highest level in the hospital wastewater. There were no zebrafish deaths at any of the concentrations of the compounds used. However, we observed histological changes, including aneurysms and edema in the gills and areas of necrosis of the liver. In summary, we found higher concentrations of CP, GEM and both metabolites (3-NH2-F and 2-DOH-DiF) were detected for the first time. There is currently no legislation regarding the discharge of anti-cancer drugs in effluents in Brazil. This study is first to focus on effluents from specific treatments from a large cancer hospital located in small city in Brazil. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WASTE-WATER
AB Applications for ozone in the United States have evolved through a lengthy maturation process, which began with drinking water treatment (taste/odor/color removal) in the early 1900s, and grew slowly until acceleration began in the mid-1980s. Although deodorization became a stable market in the 1960s-1970s, these applications were small, for the most part. One of the largest uses for ozone is oxidation of process chemicals in the chemical industry, which began in the USA about the 1940s, and subsequently has spread worldwide. Today, thanks primarily to environmental regulatory pressures which began to impact ozone in the mid-1980s, ozone now is used increasingly in the USA for drinking water treatment and for some municipal and industrial wastewater applications. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized the growing importance of ozone (> 200 drinking water plants use ozone today), and has appointed IOA representatives to two of its regulatory development committees as stakeholders. Several U.S. cities have installed or are installing wastewater treatment processes for potable reuse purposes, which include the use of ozone. Three full-scale U.S, pulp bleaching plants use tons/day quantities of ozone. Smaller applications for ozone include water treatment for cooling tower waters (biofouling control), swimming pools and spas, marine aquaria, bottled water disinfection and maintenance of high purity waters in the pharmaceuticals and electronics industries. A new application for ozone is in commercial laundries to reduce energy costs and replace chemicals. In mid-1997, a public declaration was made by an expert panel that ozone is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for contact with foods. This declaration opens the door for ozone to be used in U.S. food processing industries. U.S. research scientists and engineers are at the forefront in studies which define the technical aspects of ozone technologies in a variety of applications employing advanced oxidation, including the treatment of hazardous wastes, groundwater remediation, and process water recovery and reuse in the semi-conductor industry.

AB Microalgae applications are becoming more and more diverse, from wastewater treatment to biofuel and plastics production. Another promising and sustainable application is the removal of organic compound from drinking water and wastewater sources. This study focused on the removal of the iodinated contrast media, iohexol by the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. C. vulgaris removed 40-50% of the iohexol from the medium in 27 days, 23-30% of which was biodegraded through two main pathways: oxidation and hydrolysis. Similar transformation pathways, producing the same degradation products, were observed for incubation with microalgae and for ozonation.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and removal in wastewater and water bodies in Nakivubo wetland area and Inner Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria, of common prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutically-active substances (PhACs) sold in Kampala city, Uganda. A questionnaire was sent to 20 pharmacies in Kampala, to identify the most commonly sold PhACs in the city. During two sampling campaigns, samples were collected from Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent and surface water samples from Nakivubo channel, Nakivubo wetland and Inner Murchison Bay. The concentrations of 28 PhACs, organic matter, solids and nutrients in water samples were analysed. Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic), cetirizine (anti-allergy), metformin (anti-diabetes), metronidazole (antibiotic) and omeprazole (gastric therapy) were reported by pharmacies to be the PhACs most commonly sold in the study area. Chemical analysis of water samples revealed that trimethoprim (antibiotic) and sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) were the dominant PhACs in water from all sites except Lake Victoria. Other PhACs such as atenolol (anti-hypertensive), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic) and diclofenac (anti-inflammatory) were also found at all study sites except Lake Victoria. Sigma PhACs in effluent from Bugolobi WWTP (13000-37,600 ng L-1) was higher than in the corresponding influent (4000-28,000 ng L-1), indicating poor removal of PhACs within the WWTP. Sigma PhACs decreased by a factor of 2-6 between Bugolobi WWTP effluent and Nakivubo channel (5700 ng L-1), due to dilution and sorption to channel sediment, and by a factor of 1-3 between the Nakivubo channel and Nakivubo wetland (3900-5400 ng L-1), clue to sorption to sediment and uptake by plants in the wetland. No detectable levels of PhACs were found in water from Lake Victoria. Overall, this investigation demonstrated that PhACs in wastewater enter Nakivubo water system. Thus, Bugolobi WWTP needs to be upgraded to improve PhACs removal from wastewater. Considering the high occurrence of antibiotics in the water system in Kampala, development and spread of antimiaobial resistance within the area should also be investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler) for the evaluation of river water quality downstream of wastewater treatment plants. POCIS proved well adapted to sampling alkylphenols and several pharmaceuticals. Concentration factors and the decrease in limits of quantification, compared to grab water sample analyses, were significant except for hormones, beta-blockers and bronchodilators. Promising preliminary results obtained in situ on deuterated atenolol used as a performance reference compound need to be confirmed in-lab. This work confirms that POCIS is a valuable tool for monitoring hydrophilic organic molecules in river and wastewaters.

AB Abused drug concentrations were determined in nine Finnish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), representing the metropolitan area, university cities and rural towns. In an eight-day study period in August 2012, 24-hour composite influent wastewater samples were collected. Biological markers and census-based information were used to estimate the size of the population served. The analytical method included solid phase extraction, liquid chromatographic separation, tandem mass spectrometric identification, and quantification using isotope-labeled internal standards. The study covered amphetamines, cannabis and cocaine. The levels of some opioids used in treatment and their metabolites were also determined. Amphetamine was the most prevalent drug of abuse, the median loads varying between the cities from 4.16 to 29.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. In three western cities methamphetamine was detected in even higher amounts, ranging from 0.87 to 47.5 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. Ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine (as benzoylecgonine, BE) were found in higher concentrations during weekends compared to weekdays, the difference being statistically significant. The concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA) was below the limit of quantification in the two rural towns, while in the other cities the load varied between 3.77 and 20.7 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The average variation in BE load was 0.05-6.82 and that of MDMA 0-20.6 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. While the metropolitan area showed the highest loads of abused drugs, the substances were continuously detected at all WWTPs included in the study. The median concentration of codeine ranged from 164 to 325 mg/1000 inhabitants/d and that of morphine from 18.8 to 31.5 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The methadone load was below the level of detection in two towns, and at the other locations were 1.22-9.46 mg/1000 inhabitants/d. The first metabolite of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), was not detected at all. Although the method has limitations, wastewater analysis gives additional information for assessing the degree of drug abuse and range of drugs abused in a society. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbamazepine is an anti-epileptic pharmaceuticalcompound which is frequently detected in wastewater. However, this compound is hardly degraded naturally due to its persistency. Thus, carbamazepine presents in water stream and household water supply as well as wastewater treatment plant. This paper focuses on various species of fungi and bacteria used in carbamazepine biodegradation and the carbamazepine degrading-enzymes involved in the degradation pathways. Selected research papers on carbamazepine biodegradation using fungi and bacteria were reviewed. The efficiency and approaches in term of methodologies and technologies used were highlighted in this paper. Such study sheds light on gaps of study and future research direction on carbamazepine biodegradation.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine the application of the divalent cation bridging theory (DCBT) to improve settling, dewatering, and effluent quality in pilot-scale reactors and a full-scale system treating an industrial wastewater. This was accomplished by lowering the monovalent-to-divalent (M/D) cation ratio by direct divalent cation addition. Research has shown that the M/D ratio is a potential indicator for settling and dewatering problems at wastewater treatment plants, and M/D ratios above 2 have been associated with poor settling, dewatering, and effluent quality. The M/D ratio of the wastewater in this study ranged from 6 to 20. The cations studied were calcium and magnesium. Results showed that the addition of calcium improved floc properties compared to control reactors with no calcium addition. The reductions in sludge volume index, effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), and effluent total suspended solids (TSS) were approximately 35, 34, and 55%, respectively, when the M/D ratio was decreased to approximately 2:1. In addition, the cake solids from a belt filter press simulator increased by 72% and the optimum polymer dose required for conditioning was reduced by 70% in the reactor fed the highest calcium concentration when compared to control reactors with no calcium addition. The addition of calcium also decreased the negative effect of high filamentous organism numbers. In general, the addition of magnesium (Mg2+) had similar effects on effluent quality and dewatering properties, although some differences were measured. A full-scale test using calcium addition was performed. Measurements of effluent quality and floc properties were performed before, during, and after the calcium (Ca2+) addition period. The average M/D ratio during these periods was 6.2, 4.6, and 14.0, respectively. The addition of Ca2+ decreased the effluent five-day biochemical oxygen demand, effluent TSS, and effluent COD. The increased Ca2+ concentration also improved dewatering measured by a decrease in specific resistance to filtration and capillary suction time. Overall, the addition of divalent cations to the pilot- and full-scale activated sludge systems improved floc properties and the data fit well with the DCBT.

AB This work describes the protocol developed for preparing an artificial digested sludge to be used for the ecotoxicological evaluation and risk assessment of chemical substances that are previewed to attain the soil through sewage sludge applications for fertilization (e.g. pharmaceutical compounds). Such evaluations have been made with standard protocols for ecotoxicological tests with terrestrial species in which the chemical substances are directly spiked to the test soil. This procedure lacks ecological relevance in terms of the role the sludge organic matter plays on the bioavailability and fate of chemical substances. Here we describe the protocol and the composition for obtaining the artificial sludge, prepared with commercial pet food and eggs white to mimic the composition of domestic sewage sludge in terms of proteins, carbon hydrates, fat and fibers content. Further, the conditions ascertained for the anaerobic digestion of the organic mixture are described, and the final properties of the sludge are presented, after repeating the procedure twice.

AB A microbial process for the degradation of sulfamethazine (SMN) was studied. The activated sludge of a municipal sewage treatment plant was used to degrade SMN under controlled conditions. Results show that the aerobic condition was favored for the removal of SMN and the removal process was characterized by rapid adsorption on activated sludge and subsequent slow biodegradation. Nearly complete removal of SMN (500 mu g/L) was achieved after 120 h, which was principally attributed to biodegradation. SMN was removed at a faster pace at a higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration and temperature, while the influence of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration was comparatively insignificant. The specific pseudo-first-order rate constant per unit MLSS decreased with an increase in MLSS concentration. The temperature coefficients (theta) were similar (1.042 and 1.027) over the ranges of 10-20 degrees C and 20-30 degrees C, respectively. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Although biotransformation is generally considered to be the main process by which to remove pharmaceuticals, both in sewage treatment plants and in aquatic environments, quantitative information on specific compounds is scarce. In this study, the transformations of diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX), and bisoprolol (BSP) were studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using inocula taken from activated and digested sludge processes, respectively. Whereas concentration decays were monitored by LC-tandem mass spectrometry, oxygen consumption and methane production were used for the evaluation of the performance of overall conditions. DCF was recalcitrant against both aerobic and anaerobic biotransformation. More than one third of the BSP disappeared under aerobic conditions, whereas only 14% was anaerobically biotransformed in 161 days. Under aerobic conditions, complete removal of NPX was evident within 14 days, but anaerobic transformation was also efficient. Formation of 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, a previously reported aerobic metabolite, was also detected under anaerobic conditions and persisted for 161 days.

Twenty-one, 16 and 15 of 38 antibiotics were detected with the concentrations ranging from <0.08 (clarithromycin) to 15,163 ng/L (oxytetracycline), 2.12 (methacycline) to 1318 ng/L (erythromycin-H2O), <1.95 (ciprofloxacin) to 184 ng/g (chlortetracycline) in the seawater, discharged effluent and sediment samples, respectively. The concentrations of antibiotics in the water phase were correlated positively with chemical oxygen demand and nitrate. The source analysis indicated that untreated domestic sewage was the primary source of antibiotics in the study region. Fluoroquinolones showed strong sorption capacity onto sediments due to their high pseudo-partitioning coefficients. Risk assessment indicated that oxytetracycline, norfloxacin and erythromycin-H2O posed high risks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The waste generated from antibiotics as influents or effluents in important waters from the rivers over their increased usage is quickly leading to societal health problems. To avoid increased accumulation of these antibiotics and their waste matter, new methods and materials are required to solve the problems before escalation. This paper aimed at evaluating treated wastewater effluent quality of three wastewater treatment plants in South Africa's Vaal Triangle: Sebokeng, Rietspruit, and Leeuwkuil. The influents and effluents were collected and analysed for heavy metals, and eight antibiotic substances for human use (erythromycin, ampicillin, cimethoprim, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, chloromphemol, and sulfamethoxazol). The physicochemical parameters were also measured and the results showed that Rietspruit influent (Riet IN) had the highest salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and turbidity. Sebokeng was found to have the lowest values for all the measured parameters except for pH, which was lowest in Leeuwkuil influent (Lee IN). All the antibiotics were below the detection limit in all three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), except for sulfamethoxazole. The average concentration of sulfamethoxazole in the influents and effluents for the three investigated WWTPs ranged 39-47.8 ng L-1. The lowest concentrations of magnesium (8.60 mg L-1) and copper (0.054 mg L-1) were found in Rietspruit (Riet MID) and Lee EFF, respectively. Lee IN had the highest concentrations of Na (27.98 mg L-1), K (7.48 mg L-1), Mn (0.249 mg L-1), Cu (0.208 mg L-1), Fe (0.396 mg L-1), Ni (2.271 mg L-1), and Ca (28.60 mg L-1), while Riet IN had the highest Co concentration of 0.324 mg L-1. Sebo EFF and Sebo IN showed 11.82 mg L-1 of Mg and 2.437 mg L-1 of Zn, respectively. The abundance of the metal concentrations follows the order Ca > Na > Mg > K > Zn > Ni > Fe = Pt > Co = Au > Mn > Cu > Cr > As, indicating a higher concentration of Ca as 28.60 mg L-1, while As has the least value, which is 0.053 mg L-1.

AB Some pharmaceutical conjugates can be excreted into wastewaters at levels rivalling those of the parent compounds; however, little is known about this potential reservoir of pharmaceuticals to aquatic systems. We evaluated the occurrence and distribution of four different classes of pharmaceuticals and their metabolite conjugates in a wastewater treatment plant over four months. Aqueous and suspended solids fractions of primary, mixed liquor, secondary, and final effluent, along with return activated sludge, and waste activated sludge were assessed. The only conjugate not found in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate. Moreover, thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were the only compounds quantified in the suspended solids in the final effluent. Propranolol, propranolol sulfate, thyroxine, and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration going through the wastewater treatment process, from primary to final effluent. However, there were significant decreases observed for acetaminophen (99.8%), sulfamethoxazole (71%), N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (59%), and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide (79%). The mean (+/- SEM) mass loadings in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound ranged from 0.84 +/- 0.2 g/d for thyroxine to 45.3 +/- 4.2 g/d for acetaminophen. At least as much conjugate was released into receiving waters, if not more: 1.6 +/- 0.2 gicl for thyroxine glucuronide to 18.5 +/- 4.5 g/d for sulfamethoxazole glucuronide, and 61.2 +/- 9.6 g/d for N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, the mean loading of thyroxine was 0.29 +/- 0.025 g/day and thyroxine glucuronide 1.8 +/- 0.59 g/day in the suspended solids. This equates to 26% of total thyroxine and 53% of total thyroxine glucuronide associated with suspended particulate matter that reaches receiving waters. This study reflects the importance of including phase Il conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters, and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg/L to mu g/L range.

AB The present paper reports the adsorption performance of iron oxide nanoparticles (IOPs) for the removal of oxcarbazepine drug from wastewater. Kinetics and adsorption isotherms for the adsorption of oxcarbazepine drug on IOPs have been evaluated. Batch kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out to describe the adsorption of oxcarbazepine onto developed iron oxide nanoparticle adsorbent. Thermodynamic studies of the adsorption of oxcarbazepine onto IOPs showed negative increment G(0) and positive increment H-0, suggesting that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process, associated with mainly physical adsorption. Oxcarbazepine adsorption and intra-particle diffusion rates, adsorption capacities, equilibrium constants and enthalpy parameters were calculated.

AB The aim of this paper is to determine the ozone dosages needed to oxidize bulk and trace organics. Treated effluent from eight full-scale wastewater treatment plants was collected and subjected to lab-scale zonation. Because both organics and inorganics exert ozone demand, an approach was developed to calculate only the ozone demand associated with organics. This method allowed normalization of dosing parameters to correlate with removal of color, UV absorbance, plus oxidation of trace organics and nitrosamine precursors. We also showed that zonation effectively reduces the fraction of organic matter characterized as "colloidal organic matter," thereby reducing the potential for membrane fouling.

AB The main objective of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated and biologically treated effluent of herbal pharmaceutical industry. The acute toxicity test was determined using freshwater crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia under laboratory conditions. LC50 values for raw, neutralized and physico-chemically treated effluent for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h ranged between 3.0-4.5%, 3.9-10.8% and 22-28% respectively. It is evident from the results that physicochemical treatment reduced the toxicity by around 25% while biological treatment reduced the toxicity completely. Results subjected to statistical evaluation depicted regression coefficient of more than 0.9 indicating good correlation between the mortality rate and effluent concentrations.

AB Antibiotics are released into the environment in a variety of ways: via wastewater effluent as a result of incomplete metabolism in the body after use in human therapy, as runoff after use in agriculture, through improper disposal by private households or hospitals or through insufficient removal by water treatment plants. Unlike in most European countries, in Arctic regions effluents are not suitably treated prior to their release into the aquatic environment Also, many of the scattered human settlements in remote regions of the Arctic do not possess sewage treatment facilities and pharmaceutical residues therefore enter the aqueous environment untreated.
   Only limited data are available on the biodegradation of antibiotics under Arctic conditions. However, such information is needed to estimate the potential harm of antibiotics for the environment. Pen-G is used in this study since it is a widely prescribed antibiotic compound whose environmental properties have not yet been investigated in detail Thus, for a very first assessment, the OECD approved biodegradation Zahn-Wellens test (ZWT. OECD 302 B) was used to study biodegradation and non-biotic elimination of the antibiotic Benzyl-penicillin (Pen-G) at different temperatures (5 degrees C, 12.5 degrees C and 20 degrees C) The testing period was extended from the OECD standard of 28-42 d. In addition to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Pen-G levels and major transformation products were recorded continuously by LC-ion-trap-MS/MS. DOC monitoring revealed considerable temperature dependence for the degradation process of Pen-G. DOC loss was slowest at 5 degrees C and considerably faster at 12.5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. In the initial step of degradation it was found that Pen-G was hydrolyzed. This hydrolyzed Pen-G was subsequently further degraded by decarboxylation, the result of which was 2-(5.5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidin-2-yl)-2-(2-phenylacetamido)acetic acid. Furthermore, direct elimination of 2-phenyl-acetaldehyde from the hydrolyzed and decarboxylated Pen-G also led to the formation of 2-[amino(carboxy)methyl]-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidone-4-carboxylic acid. Since biodegradation slows down considerably at a low temperature, the resulting transformation products had considerably longer residence times at 5 degrees C compared to higher temperature conditions within the 42-d experiment. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that a risk assessment for pharmaceuticals present in low ambient temperature environments (i.e. the Arctic) cannot be based on test results obtained under standard laboratory conditions (i e. 20 degrees C ambient temperatures).

AB Toxicity of heavy metals to higher life forms is ascribed to mobility and accumulation in water reservoir. Adsorption offers a promising alternative to treat wastewater. This article proposes green and economically viable options for the replacement of expensive commercial adsorbent. The spent Camelia sinensis (black tea) and Gallus domesticus (hen egg shell) powder under identical experimental conditions possesses better sorbing potential for cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). The adsorbents can be conveniently regenerated with HCl solution. The proposed adsorbents were found successful in situ remediation of textile, pharmaceutical, and leather industry effluents. Cost benefit and batch sorption analysis strongly recommends the present experimental endeavor for commercial scale up.

AB Interaction of ciprofloxacin with the activated sludge of the sewage treatment plant is of importance for the ciprofloxacin migration and risk control. More than 96.0% ciprofloxacin was removed through the sludge adsorption. The sludge surface charge varied little with ciprofloxacin since most ciprofloxacin was dissociated into the neutral one. No obvious shift was observed for the soluble carbohydrate concentration and composition with the addition of ciprofloxacin, indicating the weak interaction between the carbohydrates and ciprofloxacin. The introduction of ciprofloxacin resulted in a reduction of the soluble protein concentration, a marked increase of the extracellular protein fluorescence intensities, and a dramatic emergence of new extracellular proteins. The alteration of the proteins highlights the strong interaction between the extracellular proteins and ciprofloxacin, and the consequent integration of certain soluble proteins and original unextractable inner layer extracellular proteins into the extractable extracellular proteins. Different types of interactions are suggested to dominate between the extracellular proteins and the differently dissociated ciprofloxacin.

AB We created a database in order to quantitatively assess the occurrence and removal efficiency of PPCPs in WWTPs. From 113 scientific publications we compiled 5887 data on the concentrations, and loads of PPCPs in WWTP influents and effluents, and on their removal efficiency. The first outputs of our database include. (1) a list of the most frequently studied molecules, their frequency of detection, their mean concentration and removal in liquid influent and effluent; (2) a comparison of the removal efficiency for different WWTP processes; (3) a study of the influence of the operating conditions (sludge and hydraulic retention times).

AB The recent monitoring of drug residues in the aquatic environment has gained much interest as many pharmaceutical compounds can frequently be found in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and river water at concentrations up to several mu g/l. This article describes the analysis of various water samples for 18 antibiotic substances, from the classes of macrolid antibiotics, sulfonamides, penicillins and tetracyclines. Samples were preconcentrated via lyophilization and quantified using HPLC-electrospray-tandem-mass spectrometry. The investigated STP effluents and surface water samples showed frequent appearance of an erythromycin degradation product, roxithromycin and sulfamethoxazole with concentrations up to 6 mu g/l. Neither tetracyclines nor penicillins could be detected at concentration levels above 50 and 20 ng/l, respectively. From the large number of ground water samples that were taken from agricultural areas in Germany, no contamination by antibiotics was detected except for two sites. This indicates that intake from veterinary applications to the aquatic environment is of minor importance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel vacuum ultraviolet excimer lamp emitting light at 193 nm was used to investigate the degradation of organic micropollutants in ultrapure water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Overall, light at 193 nm proved to be efficient to degrade the investigated micropollutants (diclofenac, diatrizoic acid, sulfamethoxazole). Experiments with WWTP effluent proved the ability of radiation at 193 nm to degrade micropollutants which are hardly removed with commonly used oxidation technologies like ozonation (diatrizoic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid).

AB Although passive sampling is widely accepted as an excellent tool for environmental monitoring, their integration with suspect or non-targeted screening by high-resolution mass spectrometry has been limited. This study describes the application of the organic-diffusive gradients in thin-films (o-DGT) passive sampler as a tool for accurate measurement of both targeted and suspect polar organic contaminants (primarily pharmaceuticals) in wastewater. First, performance of o-DGT was assessed alongside the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and active sampling at two wastewater treatment facilities using targeted analyses. Overall, water concentrations measured by o-DGT, POCIS, and 24-hr integrative active samples were in good agreement with each other. There were exceptions, including a systematic difference between o-DGT and POCIS at certain sites that we propose was a result of site-specific conditions and a difference in sampling rates between the two techniques. The second component of this work involved suspect screening of the o-DGT extracts using high-resolution, high mass accuracy quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF). Lamotrigine, venlafaxine, and desmethylvenlafaxine were three suspect compounds identified and selected as proof-of-concept case studies to determine the feasibility and accuracy of o-DGT for estimating water concentrations based upon predicted sampling rates using a previously validated o-DGT diffusion model. Semi-quantification of the suspect compounds was conducting using an average surrogate response factor based on the suite of compounds measured by the targeted analyses. This, combined with the modelled sampling rates provided time-weighted average wastewater concentrations of the identified suspects within a factor of 2 of the true value, confirmed by isotope dilution with mass labelled internal surrogates. To the knowledge of the authors, this work is the first to demonstrate the utility of the o-DGT passive sampler as a potential environmental screening tool that can be integrated into the rapidly advancing field of nontargeted high resolution mass spectrometry.

AB An engineered constructed wetland, fed with wastewater effluent, was investigated with respect to the control of organic micropollutants. The levels of 30 different micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors and personal care products, were measured using solid phase extraction, followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometer. Only 9 of the 30 chemicals exhibited relatively high concentrations in the effluent samples. Therefore, these were further characterized for their removals by the constructed wetlands. Atenolol, naproxen, and triclosan consistently showed fairly good removal trends, as measured during both May and August 2007. Sulfamethoxazole and dilantine, and carbamazepine, diazepam and triclosan exhibited medium-range and fluctuating (or somewhat low) removal behaviors, respectively. Attempts were made to determine the dominant removal mechanisms, with regard to soils and plants, using two different extraction methods. However, no substantial amounts were detected, thus it was not possible to induce potential removal mechanisms. Analyses of the removal efficiencies and two characteristic parameters (logK(ow) and pK(a)) showed no evidence supporting hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions for the control of micropollutants.

AB The ability of UV/AOP to treat trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in wastewater is inhibited by (1) UV light-absorbing species and (2) hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging species. We address these challenges by investigating four diverse technologies, single-stage biofiltration, sequential biofiltration, coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation-filtration (CFSF), and nanofiltration, as options for improving water quality conditions just prior to UV treatment, with and without added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). By evaluating UV254 transmittance (UVT), OH scavengers, and OH steady-state concentrations, we found nanofiltration treatment to produce the most favorable pre-UV and UV/H2O2 water quality conditions. In comparing CFSF, single-stage biofiltration and sequential biofiltration treatment, CFSF treatment resulted in the highest increase in UVT and all three technologies reduced the scavenging capacity by approximate to 24% despite differences in removal of typical OH scavengers. UV and UV/H2O2 performance were evaluated by tracking the degradation rates of 11 targeted TOrCs for each pre-UV/H2O2 treatment scenario. Applying the additional treatment, average pseudo first-order degradation rates of TOrCs under UV/H2O2 increased by 20 to 92%, informing potential strategies to increase the oxidation potential of UV/AOP systems applied to wastewater.

AB Due to advances in analytical techniques and increasing concerns related to the potential impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms, the reported occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in groundwater has significantly increased during the past two decades. This chapter provides an overview of the detection of pharmaceutical, life-style, and endocrine disruptor compounds in groundwater from five geographical areas (Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and North America). The occurrence of these compounds has been linked to the four major sources of contamination: agricultural practices/wastes, landfill, septic tanks, and wastewater. The concentration of the detected compounds ranged between ng/L and mu g/L. Pharmaceutical compounds, in particular antibiotic and analgesic/anti-inflammatory, represent the most common group detected in groundwater, regardless of the geographic location. Carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic), and caffeine (life-style) represent the three most common compounds detected in groundwater. The occurrence of the detected compounds in groundwater is primarily related to wastewater and/or agricultural practices/wastes. None of the detected compounds has been linked to all four major sources of contamination. However, five compounds (ibuprofen, paracetamol, triclosan, caffeine and cotinine) have been linked to three sources of contamination such as wastewater, landfill, and septic tanks.

AB A pilot-scale municipal wastewater reclamation system using combined coagulation and disk filtration (CC-DF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane has been built to investigate removal of water contaminants and fouling mitigation. The reclaimed water using the pilot system could meet draft regulations on wastewater reuse of the California Department of Public Health (DOC: 0.5 mgC/L; TN: 5 mgN/L). The removal of micropolluants by the CC-DF process and UF could not be evaluated by their MW, Log D, and charge characteristics. However, they were identified as governing factors affecting the removal of micropollutants by the RD. The CC-DF process might effectively remove particulate materials capable of contributing to cake layer formation on the UF membrane surfaces but the residual coagulants provided a strong effect on fouling formation of the UF membrane. Thus, hydrophobic fractions of the desorbed UF membrane foulants were higher than those of the desorbed RD membrane foulants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was carried out to intensify the electrochemical treatment of bulk drug pharmaceutical wastewater (BDW) using ultrasound. The effects of the operating parameters on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency were studied using a response surface methodology-based central composite design. Under optimum conditions that included an ultrasonic power of 67 W, a current density of 173 A m(-2), an initial pH of 4.5, and an interelectrode distance of 0.5 cm, COD and TOC removal efficiencies were found to be 69% and 60%, respectively; the specific energy consumption was 0.69 kWh (g of COD removed)(-1), and a synergistic effect of 1.1 was obtained. The morphology and topography analysis of the electrodes after the treatment confirmed continuous in situ cleaning of the electrode because of the use of ultrasound. A possible mineralization pathway based on transformation products formed (identified using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy) was proposed. Phytotoxicity analysis showed that the toxicity of BDW was significantly reduced and the seed germination rate increased to 85% after treatment.

AB Untreated pharmaceutical pollution and their possibly toxic metabolites, resulting from overloaded wastewater treatment processes, end up in aquatic environments and are hazardous to the ecosystem homeostasis. Biological wastewater remediation could supplement traditional methods and overcome the release of these biologically active compounds in the environment. Mycoremediation is especially promising due to the unspecific nature of fungi to decompose compounds through exoenzymes and the uptake of compounds as nutrients. In the present study, we improved on the previous advances made using the fungus Mucor hiemalis to remediate one of the most commonly occurring pharmaceuticals, acetaminophen (APAP), at higher concentrations. The limitation of nitrogen, adjustment of pH, and comparison to, as well as co-cultivation with the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, were tested. Nitrogen limitation did not significantly improve the APAP remediation efficiency of M. hiemalis. Maintaining the pH of the media improved the remediation restraint of 24 h previously observed. The APAP remediation efficiency of P. chrysosporium was far superior to that of M. hiemalis, and co-cultivation of the two resulted in a decreased remediation efficiency compared to P. chrysosporium in single.

AB Pharmaceuticals, once ingested, are commonly metabolized in the body into more polar and soluble forms. These compounds might not be completely removed in the wastewater treatment plants and consequently being discharged into the aquatic ecosystem. In this work, a multi-class sensitive method for the analysis of 21 compounds, including 7 widely consumed pharmaceuticals and 14 relevant metabolites, has been developed based on the use of UHPLC-MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The method was validated in six surface waters (SW) and six effluent wastewaters (EWW) at realistic concentration levels that can be found in waters. The optimized method was applied to the analysis of different types of water samples (rivers, lakes and effluent wastewater), detecting nearly all the parent compounds and metabolites investigated in this work. This fact illustrates that not only pharmaceuticals but also their metabolites are commonly present in these types of waters. Analytical research and monitoring programs should be directed not only towards parent pharmaceuticals but also towards relevant metabolites to have a realistic overview of the impact of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

AB The external environment, particularly wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where environmental bacteria meet human commensals and pathogens in large numbers, has been highlighted as a potential breeding ground for antibiotic resistance. We have isolated the extensively drug-resistant Ochrobactrum intermedium CCUG 57381 from an Indian WWTP receiving industrial wastewater from pharmaceutical production contaminated with high levels of quinolones. Antibiotic susceptibility testing against 47 antibiotics showed that the strain was 4 to> 500 times more resistant to sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and the aminoglycoside streptomycin than the type strain O. intermedium LMG 3301(T). Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations in the Indian strain causing amino acid substitutions in the target enzymes of quinolones. We also characterized three acquired regions containing resistance genes to sulfonamides (sul1), tetracyclines [tet(G) and tetR], and chloramphenicol/ florfenicol (floR). Furthermore, the Indian strain harbored acquired mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer, including a type I mating pair-forming system (MPFI), a MOBP relaxase, and insertion sequence transposons. Our results highlight that WWTPs serving antibiotic manufacturing may provide nearly ideal conditions for the recruitment of resistance genes into human commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

   aquifer treatment (SAT)
AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is considered to be an alternative technique able to enhance recharged water quality for aquifer recharge purposes. It allows the reuse of treated wastewater, which usually contains some recalcitrant organic micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This study reports the removal capacity for a selection of organic micropollutants during SAT and the characterisation of the recharge system for the interpretation of the data. The experiment was performed in Angerville (France), where the treated wastewater effluent of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is directly infiltrated through an excavated infiltration pond after biological treatment. The system was instrumented by installing piezometers downgradient of the infiltration pond, which were monitored, together with other reference points, and analysed for detailed interpretation. Results on the site characterisation allowed the quantification of the mixing proportion of the recharge water and groundwater and identification of the redox conditions encountered within the aquifer. With respect to the targeted micropollutants, results showed that they exhibited different behaviour during infiltration. Examples of atrazine, gemfibrozil and carbamazepine are discussed as a representation of the most characteristic patterns of organic contaminant fate after recharge.

AB Advanced treatment of a complex pharmaceutical wastewater by Desal-5 DK nanofiltration (NF) membrane was carried out. The membrane fouling and chemical cleaning in this application were investigated. It was found that at the initial stage of NF process, the deposition of sulfate and carbonate of calcium was the main cause of membrane fouling. At the later fouling stage, besides calcium salts, complex organic foulants containing carboxyl acid, amide, and alkyl halide functional groups also deposited onto membrane surface and gradually formed a densely packed fouling layer. Accordingly, in cleaning process, the efficiency of a cleaning agent depended on its ability to break down the integrity of the compact fouling layer by reacting with the foulants. The results showed that the cleaning efficiencies of the agents increased in the sequence of NaOH (pH 11) < HCl (pH 2) < citric acid (pH 2) < EDTA (10 mM). After cleaning with EDTA for 60 min, the membrane flux recovery ratio reached 99.0%. The SEM image and element content of the membrane cleaned by EDTA were quite similar to those of the virgin membrane. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor was evaluated for efficacy in reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of bulk drug pharmaceutical wastewater under different operational conditions. The start-up of the reactor feed came entirely with glucose, applied at an organic loading rate (OLR) 1 kg COD/m(3) d. Then the reactor was studied at different OLRs ranging from 2 to 11 kg COD/m(3) d with pharmaceutical wastewater. The optimum OLR was found to be 9 kg COD/m3 d, where we found 65-75% COD and 80-94% of BOD reduction with biogas production containing 60-70% of methane and specific methanogenic activity was 320 ml CH4/g-VSS d. By the characterization studies of effluent using GC-MS, the hazardous compounds like phenol, 1,2-methoxy phenol, 2.4,6-trichloro phenol, dibutyl phthalate. 1-bromo naphthalene, carbamazepine and antipyrine were present. After the treatment, these compounds degraded almost completely except carbamazepine. Thermophilic methanothrix and methanosaetae like bacteria are present in the granular sludge.

AB Prescription and nonprescription drugs have been detected in rivers and streams in Europe and the United States. Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important source of these contaminants, but few data exist on the spatial distribution of drugs in surface waters near STPs. Samples of surface water were collected in the summer and fall of 2000 at open-water sites in the lower Great Lakes (Lake Ontario and Lake Erie), at sites near the two STPs for the city of Windsor (ON, Canada), and at sites in Hamilton Harbour (ON. Canada), an embayment of western Lake Ontario that receives discharges from several STPs. In a follow-up study in the summer of 2002. samples of surface water and final effluent from adjacent STPs were collected from sites in Hamilton Harbour and Windsor. In addition, surface water and STP effluent samples were collected in Peterborough (ON, Canada). All samples of surface water and STP effluents were analyzed for selected acidic and neutral drugs. In the survey of Hamilton Harbour and Windsor conducted in 2000, acidic drugs and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were detected at ng/L concentrations at sites that were up to 500 in away from the STP, but the hydrological conditions of the receiving waters strongly influenced the spatial distribution of these compounds. Drugs were not detected at open-water locations in western Lake Erie or in the Niagara River near the municipality of Niagara-on-the-Lake (ON, Canada). However, clofibric acid, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, and carbamazepine were detected in samples collected in the summer of 2000 at sites in Lake Ontario and at a site in the Niagara River (Fort Erie, ON. Canada) that were relatively remote from STP discharges. Follow-up studies in the summer of 2002 indicated that concentrations of acidic and neutral drugs in surface waters near the point of sewage discharge into the Little River (ON, Canada) STP were approximately equal to the concentrations in the final effluent from the STP. Caffeine and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine. were generally present in STP effluents and surface waters contaminated by drugs. The antidepressant fluoxetine and the antibiotic trimethoprom were also detected in most STP effluents and some surface water samples. For the first time, the lipid regulating drug atorvastatin was detected in samples of STP effluent and surface water.

AB The presence of diclofenac in the aquatic environment and the risks for aquatic wildlife, especially fish, have been raised in several studies. One way to manage risks without enforcing improved wastewater treatment would be to substitute diclofenac (when suitable from a clinical perspective) with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) associated with less environmental risk. While there are many ecotoxicity-studies of different NSAIDs, they vary extensively in set-up, species studied, endpoints and reporting format, making direct comparisons difficult. We previously published a comprehensive study on the effects of diclofenac in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Our present aim was to generate relevant effect data for another NSAID (naproxen) using a very similar setup, which also allowed direct comparisons with diclofenac regarding hazards and risks. Sticklebacks were therefore exposed to naproxen in flow-through systems for 27 days. Triplicate aquaria with 20 fish per aquarium were used for each concentration (0, 18, 70, 299 or 1232 mu g/L). We investigated bioconcentration, hepatic gene expression, jaw lesions, kidney and liver histology. On day 21, mortalities in the highest exposure concentration group unexpectedly reached >= 25 % in all three replicate aquaria, leading us to terminate and sample that group the same day. On the last day (day 27), the mortality was also significantly increased in the second highest exposure concentration group. Increased renal hematopoietic hyperplasia was observed in fish exposed to 299 and 1232 mu g/L. This represents considerably higher concentrations than those expected in surface waters as a result of naproxen use. Such effects were observed already at 4.6 mu g/L in the experiment with diclofenac (lowest tested concentration). Similar to the responses to diclofenac, a concentration-dependent increase in both relative hepatic gene expression of c7 (complement component 7) and jaw lesions were observed, again at concentrations considerably higher than expected in surface waters. Naproxen bioconcentrated less than diclofenac, in line with the observed effect data. An analysis of recent sales data and reported concentrations in treated sewage effluent in Sweden suggest that despite higher dosages used for naproxen, a complete substitution would only be expected to double naproxen emissions. In summary, naproxen and diclofenac produce highly similar effects in fish but the environmental hazards and risks are clearly lower for naproxen. Hence, if there are concerns for environmental risks to fish with diclofenac, a substitution would be advisable when naproxen presents an adequate alternative from a clinical point-of-view.

AB The transport pathways of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP) discharges within the urban water cycle include both combined and separate sewer systems with only the former receiving treatment. The dry-weather flow dilution patterns for selected PPCPs following discharge from a sewage treatment works (STW) to a North London stream indicate a persistent downstream increase in concentration. The dilution ratio analysis also indicates that the STW's final effluent only contributes a dilution of the endogenous concentrations already present in the river flow which reflects a progressive PPCP load with increasing urbanization; "worst-case" scenarios being probably related to wet-weather conditions. Maximum PPCP concentrations fall above the reported PEC levels and the analysis highlights the deficiencies of conventional acute toxicity for the evaluation of long-term effects of episodic urban discharges. Groundwater analysis points to sewer extiltration which is limited in terms of PPCP impact to 25-50 cm depths. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to evaluate surface water and the sediment quality of rivers connected to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment technologies, fish embryo tests (FET) with Danio rerio were conducted using native water and sediment samples collected upstream and downstream of four WWTPs in Southern Germany. Two of these WWTPs are connected to the Schussen River, a tributary of Lake Constance, and use a sand filter with final water purification by flocculation. The two others are located on the rivers Schmiecha and Eyach in the area of the Swabian Alb and were equipped with a powdered activated carbon stage 20 years ago, which was originally aimed at reducing the release of stains from the textile industry. Several endpoints of embryo toxicity including mortality, malformations, reduced hatching rate, and heart rate were investigated at defined time points of embryonic development. Higher embryotoxic potentials were found in water and sediments collected downstream of the WWTPs equipped with sand filtration than in the sample obtained downstream of both WWTPs upgraded with a powdered activated carbon stage.

AB This article reports the first identification of paraben-chlorinated derivatives in river water. Parabens are widely used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Parabens can be easily chlorinated by chlorinated tap water. The resulting chlorinated derivatives might pose a higher potential risk to humans and ecosystems than the corresponding parent parabens. However, the occurrence of such derivatives in rivers remains unknown so far. We studied 23 parabens and their chlorinated derivatives from rivers receiving effluents from sewage treatment plants in Shizuoka city, in the central Pacific region of Japan. The compounds were extracted by solid-phase extraction with a styrene polymer sorbent, trimethylsilyl-derivatized, and then identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six chlorinated parabens and their primary degradation products, two chlorinated hydroxybenzoic acids, were found for the first time in river water. Moreover, in river water, chlorinated derivatives preferentially partition into the suspended-solid phase.

AB Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately, the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 degrees C) were approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined at 600 degrees C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 degrees C) and GCN (without NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (center dot O-2(-) and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of TC-HCI, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%), deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high amounts (1.428 x 10(7) P/cm(3)) restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9 and 94.3 mu mol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater, water from reservoir and tap water, respectively. This study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Twelve pilot-scale constructed wetlands with different configurations were set up in the field to evaluate the removal and factors that influence removal of sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfacetamide, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole) and trimethoprim from domestic sewage. The treatments included four flow types, three substrates, two plants and three hydraulic loading rates across two seasons (summer and winter). Most target antibiotics were efficiently removed by specific constructed wetlands; in particular, all types of constructed wetlands performed well for the degradation of sulfapyridine. Flow types were the most important influencing factor in this study, and the best removal of sulfonamides was achieved in vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetlands; however, the opposite phenomenon was found with trimethoprim. Significant relationships were observed between antibiotic degradation and higher temperature and redox potential, which indicated that microbiological pathways were the most probable degradation route for sulfonamides and trimethoprim in constructed wetlands.

AB In this study, a lab-scale multiple draft tubes airlift loop membrane bioreactor (Mt-ALMBR) was used for treating acidic 7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) wastewater under different pHs (3.54-6.20) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (48 h, 36 h, 24 h and 16 h). During about 200 days operation, under HRT of 48 h and pH condition about 6.0, the optimum average COD and BOD5 removal rates were reach to 84.4 +/- 2.1% and 94.9 +/- 0.8%, and the highest 7-ACA removal rate also observed as 77.6%. Biodegradation, membrane rejection, hydrolysis and sludge adsorption were the four main pathways of 7-ACA removal. With the increase of pH, biodegradation, membrane rejection and hydrolysis had significant positive impacts on 7-ACA removal, while adsorption had a negative impact. Moreover, mathematical models for 7-ACA removal rate and pH were calculated to guide the operation of Mt-ALMBR. Biodegradation was the main pathway to remove 7-ACA when pH was > 4.17.

AB This research attempts to evaluate a previously developed model for predicting influent concentrations of prescription pharmaceuticals and understand why some drugs are more accurately predicted than others. It also investigates the impact of demographics on influent drug concentrations in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Samples from two WWTPs in the southeastern United States indicate that the model generates concentration estimates that are accurate to within at least one order of magnitude for a diverse set of drug compounds. Additionally, strategically timed sampling at college-town WWTPs, wherein 19-25% of the population comprises students ages 18-22, reveals that the influent concentrations of several drugs (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and metformin) generally prescribed to older-than-average persons increase while students are absent on holiday, whereas the influent concentration of one drug (-ethynyl estradiol) prescribed to younger-than-average persons decreases. These observations reveal the impacts of demographics on prescription drug concentrations in WWTP influents, offering some explanation for the wide variability among previously measured influent drug concentrations. It was also observed that hospital size is generally correlated with increased influent drug concentrations. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB In this research, modification of bentonite and synthesis of Fe3O4/Bentonite nanocomposite are reported in the presence of ultrasound. The samples were prepared by chemical co-precipitation and sonochemical methods and the structural order, textural, magnetic, and surface area properties were examined using XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, VSM, BET, and point of zero charge pH (pH(pzc)) analysis. Then the as synthesized nanocomposite was used to remove nitrate, BOD and COD from water and industrial wastewater. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted, where the influence of several parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent amount, and nitrate concentration were studied. According to the results, the best nitrate removal (79%) by using the prepared nanocomposite was achieved at the pH of 5, the contact time of 90 min, adsorbent amount of 0.6 g and the initial nitrate concentration of 30 mg/l. For further investigation, some tests were conducted on industrial wastewater of pharmaceutical units to evaluate the BOD and COD reduction. Using 2 g of synthesized sample, 84.88% of BOD and 88.8% of COD of the industrial wastewater were removed.

AB Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) is a major anionic surfactant used in detergents worldwide and as such is a ubiquitous constituent of domestic and municipal wastewaters. Increasingly, constructed wet-lands are being employed as a low cost and sustainable alternative to traditional wastewater treatment processes. Plants are known to play a vital role both directly and indirectly in the removal of contaminants in wastewater treatment constructed wetlands. However, relatively little research has been conducted into the manipulation of the plant component in order to optimise constructed wetland performance. Furthermore, little is known about the role of plants in the removal of specific contaminants including LAS. The present study investigated the effects of plant biomass and plant species on LAS removal in a series of experimental subsurface flow wetlands. Our results confirm that the presence of vegetation enhances LAS removal, with higher biomass systems associated with higher LAS removal rates. Differences in LAS removal were also observed between different plant species, although these were not found to be statistically significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methylamine (MA) is an organic compound that can be found in many commercial applications (agricultural chemicals, including herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, biocides, and miticides; catalysts; pharmaceuticals; resin manufacturing). It has a strong odor similar to fish and can cause chemical burns to the eyes and skin. The vapor from this chemical is extremely irritating to the nose, throat, lungs, skin, and eyes. The indiscriminate discharge of improperly treated chemical contaminated wastewater or wastes into a natural water body will cause serious environmental pollution problems and severe adverse impacts to the aquatic ecology. The goal of this investigation is to remove MA using a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and to understand the ability of mixed bacteria strains to treat different initial MA concentrations in synthetic and actual industrial wastewaters in the CSTR. The following results were obtained: When the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 1.136 day, the MA removed efficiency in the CSTR was the best. When the HRT was 1.136 day, the mixed strains could utilize 1000 mg l(-1) MA both from synthetic wastewater and actual industrial wastewater for growth in the CSTR. The MA removal efficiency reached 100% in the CSTR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a toxic and carcinogenic compound that is commonly released from pharmaceutical, chemical and related industry wastewater. Currently, the effects of THF contamination on wastewater are unknown and a better understanding of THF toxicity toward biological processes in wastewater treatment is critical. In this study, we firstly investigated the toxic effects of THF on enzymatic activity and the microbial diversity in activated sludge from a sequencing batch reactor during long-term exposure to 10 mM THF. The activity of five enzymes (catalase, dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and protease) was remarkably decreased in the presence of 10 mM THF during a period of 85 days. Of these five affected enzymes, dehydrogenase activity was close to detection level limits and was nearly completely inhibited. Analysis of the microbial community demonstrated that THF, at a concentration of 10 mM, altered the distribution of microbes within the community and significantly decreased microbial diversity during long-term contamination, according to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. The fraction of Actinobacteria increased in the community, while the fraction of Proteobacteria significantly decreased after THF exposure.

AB The list of priority chemicals included in various regulations such as the European Water Framework Directive, as well as the list of hazardous contaminants identified in the aquatic environment, are increasing at an accelerated pace. Therefore, there is a need for broad spectrum methods capable of simultaneously determining hundreds, if not thousands, of contaminants. For the analysis of non-polar or semi-polar contaminants, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography ( GC x GC) is more powerful than conventional gas chromatography thanks to a separation on two different stationary phases. This paper reports the use of GC x GC for a broad screening of hazardous contaminants in an urban wastewater plant. Comparison between the raw and treated wastewater has been carried out using a semi-quantitative approach. A variety of drugs, personal care products, pesticides, carcinogens and compounds toxic for reproduction, were identified. Most of these compounds were removed or decreased by this wastewater treatment plant. Preliminary results from this single plant will need to be confirmed by a more extensive study before drawing conclusions on the removal efficiency of 2D-GC amenable compounds.

AB Wastewaters (WW) are important sources for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) into the environment. Hospital WW (HWW) contain higher loads of micro-pollutants and AMR markers than urban WW (UWW). Little is known about the long-term dynamics of H and U WW and the impact of their joined treatment on the general burden of AMR. Here, we characterized the resistome, microbiota and eco-exposome signature of 126 H and U WW samples treated separately for three years, and then mixed, over one year. Multi-variate analysis and machine learning revealed a robust signature for each WW with no significant variation over time before mixing, and once mixed, both WW closely resembled Urban signatures. We demonstrated a significant impact of pharmaceuticals and surfactants on the resistome and microbiota of H and U WW. Our results present considerable targets for AMR related risk assessment of WW.

AB The major pathway of pharmaceuticals from urban applications to urban surface waters is via wastewater treatment plants. Ozonation is able to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents. However, during that reaction, ozonation products are formed. Some ozonation products were found to be persistent and have adverse effect on the environment. Moving bed bio reactors (MBBRs) were tested for the removal of the ozonation products of macrolide antibiotics and diclofenac at two different concentration levels 1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L in laboratory reactors. It was found that the MBBRs are capable of degrading these compounds without back-transformation into the parent compounds. However, reaction rate constants and the degradation kinetics varied for different compounds and different concentrations. Depending on compound and conditions, the degradation reaction kinetics was found to follow either i) zero order ii) first order or iii) lag phase succeeded by first order. The study has proven that MBBRs have the potential to be efficient in polishing post ozonation treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread use of pharmaceuticals in both human and animal populations, and the resultant contamination of surface waters from the outflow of water treatment facilities is an issue of growing concern. This has raised the need for analytical methods that can both perform rapid sample analysis and overcome the limitations of conventional analysis procedures, such as multistep workflows and tedious procedures. Coated blade spray (CBS) is a solid-phase microextraction based technique that enables the direct-to mass-spectrometry analysis of extracted compounds via the use of limited organic solvent to desorb analytes and perform electrospray ionization. This paper documents how CBS can be applied for the concomitant tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of nine pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater. The total analysis times of less than 11 min provided limits of detection lower than 50 ng L-1 for all target compounds in river water. The CBS methodology was then compared to a conventional solid-phase extraction technique for the analysis of the final effluent of six wastewater treatment facilities. The experimental results strongly suggest that CBS offers scientists a viable alternative method for analyzing water samples that is both rapid and relatively solvent-free.

AB We carried out a project aimed to evaluate the possible role played by the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the possible decrease of some environmental pollutants recalcitrant to tradition wastewater treatments. By the help of a pilot-plant built in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Milan (Italy), we tested several waste mixtures in order to measure the chemicals' abatement made by mussels' biofiltration. This study represents the last step of the wider project and it aimed to evaluate if the decrease in the concentration of some urban pollutants measured in wastewaters was followed by a corresponding toxicity reduction. Thus, we performed 7-day exposures under laboratory conditions to test the toxicity of the raw wastewaters and those preliminary filtered by zebra mussels, through the measurement of different end-points of acute and chronic toxicity. Results showed a clear positive effect of mussels' biofiltration mainly to decrease the acute toxicity made by the two tested wastewater mixtures, while the biomarkers' suite used to evaluate the chronic toxicity showed contradictory results.

AB Methyl orange is used in textile, printing, paper, manufacturing, pharmaceutical or food industries and in research laboratories. Because of its structure, this dye is rather difficult to degrade and is used as reference for advanced removal of dyes from the textile industry. Wastewater removal using second raw materials for substrates development represents a novel trend that complies with the sustainability requirements. As substrates ash, especially fly ash is investigated but attempts were done also for the use of raw wood wastes. The potential capacity of sawdust as adsorbent for the methyl orange (MO) dye was tested in our work. Three types of sawdust were tested: oak wood (Querqus robur), white poplar (Populus alba) and willow (Salix alba L.) along with their mixtures with fly ash. The adsorption efficiency of MO was tested from 0.1 mMol/L solution. We evaluate the effects of various parameters such as contact time, initial dye concentration, pH. The equilibrium data were modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and the adsorption mechanisms was discussed, correlated with the substrates structure and morphology. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model.

AB A method has been developed for the trace analysis of 15 pharmaceuticals, four metabolites of pharmaceuticals, three potential endocrine disruptors, and one personal care product in various waters. The method employs solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative modes. Unlike many previous LC-MS/MS methods, which suffer from matrix suppression, this method uses isotope dilution for each compound to correct for matrix suppression, as well as SPE losses and instrument variability. The method was tested in five matrices, and results indicate that the method is very robust. Matrix spike recoveries for all compounds were between 88 and 106% for wastewater influent, 85 and 108% for wastewater effluent, 72 and 105% for surface water impacted by wastewater, 96 and 113% for surface water, and 91 and 116% for drinking water. The method reporting limits for all compounds were between 0.25 and 1.0 ng/ L, based on 500 mL of sample extracted and a final extract volume of 500 mu L. Occurrence of the compounds in all five matrices is also reported.

AB A visible light responsive TiO2/Ag3PO4(10 : 1) nanocomposite was prepared and successfully immobilized (12 wt%) in a spherical polymeric matrix consisting of polysulfone and alginate (10 : 6). The resulted beads featured a sponge-like structure with interconnected macrovoids and micropores, and showed high adsorption and visible-light photocatalytic activity towards various wastewater pollutants, including the widely used dye - methylene blue (k= 0.0321 min(-1)), and two emerging pharmaceutical contaminants - diclofenac (k= 0.018 min(-1)) and triclosan (k= 0.052 min(-1)). As determined, the degrees OH radical and h(+)are the primary reactive oxygen species responsible for the photodegradation. The composite photocatalytic beads are also effective in bacterial inactivation and degradation of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), the bacterial quorum sensing autoinducers triggering biofilms, thus exhibiting a promising future in wastewater disinfection and biofilm retardation. Additionally, these beads could be used in inter-switchable suspended or buoyant forms, and be effectively regenerated by H(2)O(2)treatment, and used for multiple cycles without any significant loss in photoactivity. With these unique features, the prepared visible-light photocatalytic beads could be easily applied in large-scale water and wastewater treatment systems.

AB The nano nickel(II) oxide (NiO) was synthesized by sol-gel method and used for degradation of Amoxicillin (AMO) from pharmaceutical wastewater. In this laboratory study, the effects of nanoparticle dose (0.25-2 g/L), reaction time (10-120 min), initial antibiotic concentration (25-200 mg/L) and lamp power (15 W) on AMO removal efficiency were assessed in a batch photocatalytic reactor. Antibiotic concentration in output was measured by the spectrophotometer at the maximum wavelength of 280 nm. The optimum nano NiO dose was obtained to be 0.2 g/L. In this study, the removal efficiency decreased with increasing the concentration of AMO. Under optimal conditions of concentration, the removal efficiency was 96%. It was found that increasing the exposure time to UV increased the rate of AMO degradation in solution. The results also showed that the photo-degradation reaction approximately follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics with constant rates of 0.084, 0.074 and 0.046 min(-1) for concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 mg/L, respectively. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that UV/NiO photocatalytic process can efficiently remove AMO from pharmaceutical wastewater.

AB We have reported on the potential use of membrane distillation (MD) to remove emerging pollutants from wastewater as an alternative to other biological and chemical treatments. For every successful application of MD, the fouling and scaling associated with membrane wetting must be reduced to minimize the deterioration in performance. Here, we have hypothesized that the effectiveness of the antibiotic removal from wastewater can be significantly influenced by the interfacial interaction between the antibiotics and the membrane surface. To verify this, we investigated the applicability of the direct contact MD (DCMD) to treat the antibiotics, including positively-charged tobramycin (TOB), negatively-charged cefotaxime (CTX), and neutral ciprofloxacin (CFX). DCMD tests were performed with negatively-charged commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, with the observance of a significant decline in flux and wetting issues during the MD treatment of TOB. The PVDF membrane exhibited a stable flux (CTX: 19.76 LMH and CFX: 19.81 LMH), with almost 100% rejection of the CTX and CFX due to electrostatic repulsion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) further elucidates the insitu fouling development for TOB, CTX and CFX.

AB As a porous-adsorbent material, activated carbon was used to remove the environmental pollution in the pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. In the present paper, granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC) were subjected as an adsorbent to reduce the concentration of estradiol valerate (EV) and progesterone (PRO) hormones. The effects of adsorbent amount, initial pH of solution, contact time, initial concentration of pollutant and temperature were studied. Among the pseudo-first-order- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, the latter fit accurately the experimental data. The highest level of adsorption percentage of the contaminants occurs within the first 480 min. The maximum adsorption capacity and thermodynamic parameters were shown that GAC and PAC can be selected as appropriate and effective pharmaceutical wastewater treatment techniques. In addition, some additional experimental characterizations such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to detect the possible structural changes due to the adsorption of EV and PRO onto the GAC and PAC, which show these hormones have been successfully added onto the adsorbent surface.

AB This study focused on the removal of antibiotic by coupling of heterogeneous photocatalysis with ozonation and hydrogen peroxide. The main objective was to intensify the efficiency of photocatalytic activity for better and faster antibiotic elimination/mineralization in wastewater. To fulfill this purpose a photocatalytic process based on falling film reactor was designed and optimized. The effects of operating parameters such as wastewater flow rate in the falling film reactor, the presence of an oxidizing agent (H2O2 and O-3), inlet concentrations, including catalyst dosage and light intensity were investigated and discussed. Experiments were mainly conducted with Flumequine and Clarithromycin. The first molecule (Flumequine) will serve as an example of fiuoroquinolone antibiotics and the second (Clarithromycin) as an example of macrolide antibiotics. Experimentally, the results have shown interesting degradation and mineralization efficiency (on the order of 94% for degradation and 76% for mineralization). Evidence for redox catalysis was shown using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after pollutant degradation. Moreover, special attention was also paid to identify the reaction products and the plausible degradation pathway during Flumequine degradation.

AB Present study evaluated the effect of effluent from submerged aerated biological filter (SABF) and activated sludge process (ASP) on the performance of membrane bioreactor (MBR). MBR was operated both in external configuration and internal configuration mode. Feeding SABF effluent to MBR resulted in a flux reduction of 2.3% and 12% under external and internal configurations, respectively. Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) removal from SABF effluent by MBR was only 13% in the external configuration mode whereas VOC was completely eliminated in the internal configuration mode. Treatment of effluent from ASP caused significant flux reduction and increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP) in the MBR. For both internal and external membrane configurations, substantial increase in extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) and suspended solids resulted in higher membrane fouling during the treatment of ASP effluent. VOC removal from ASP effluent by MBR was achieved only while adopting internal configuration mode. Effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater, with less impact on membrane performance and reduced VOC emission to the atmosphere, can be achieved by coupling SABF with MBR and adopting internal configuration mode.

AB This research addresses some critical challenges regarding the validation of a quantitative multi-residue method for pharmaceuticals in wastewater making use of modern SPE-LC-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. Particular attention is given to study in detail response linearity, to realistically estimate detection limits, and to express the measurement precision of the analyte concentration, obtained by external calibration.
   First, linearity of the Orbitrap response showed to be matrix dependent in a counter intuitive way: stronger deviations from linearity were observed for pure solvent standards than for complex matrices like wastewater. Second, detection limits risk to be overestimated for ubiquitously present compounds for which true blank matrix samples are hard to find, leading to false negative findings. A novel and easy applicable methodology is presented to allow a better estimation of detection limits using the response of the natural isotopes. Third, a statistical methodology to estimate the measurement precision of the analyte concentration using basic validation parameters is developed specifically for the context of multi-residue quantification.

AB Significant quantities of antibiotics are used in all parts of the globe to treat diseases with bacterial origins. After ingestion, antibiotics are excreted by the patient and transmitted in due course to the aquatic environment. This study examined temporal fluctuations (monthly time scale) in antibiotic sources (ambulatory sales and data from a hospital dispensary) for Lausanne, Switzerland. Source variability (i.e., antibiotic consumption, monthly data for 2006-2010) were examined in detail for nine antibiotics - azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, from which two main conclusions were reached. First, some substances - azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin - displayed high seasonality in their consumption, with the winter peak being up to three times higher than the summer minimum. This seasonality in consumption resulted in seasonality in Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs). In addition, the seasonality in PECs was also influenced by that in the base wastewater flow. Second, the contribution of hospitals to the total load of antibiotics reaching the Lausanne Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) fluctuated markedly on a monthly time scale, but with no seasonal pattern detected. That is, there was no connection between fluctuations in ambulatory and hospital consumption for the substances investigated.

AB Hospital wastewater contains high concentrations of pharmaceuticals, which pose risks to receiving waters. In this study, a pilot plant consisting of six moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) in series (with the intention to integrate Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal, nitrification and denitrification as well as prepolishing Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) for ozonation) was built to integrate pharmaceutical removal and intermittent feeding of the latter reactors aimed for micropollutant removal. Based on the experimental resultss, nitrifying MBBRs achieved higher removal as compared to denitrifying MBBRs except for azithromycin, clarithromycin, diatrizoic acid, propranolol and trimethoprim. In the batch experiments, nitrifying MBBRs showed the ability to remove most of the analysed pharmaceuticals, with degradation rate constants ranging from 5.0 x 10(-3) h(-1) to 2.6 h(-1). In general, the highest degradation rate constants were observed in the nitrifying MBBRs while the latter MBBRs showed lower degradation rate constant. However, when the degradation rate constants were normalised to the respective biomass, the intermittently fed reactors presented the highest specific activity. Out of the 22 compounds studied, 17 compounds were removed with more than 20%.

AB The occurrence of some veterinary medicines in the livestock wastewater plants (WWTPs) was investigated. This investigation represented the occurrence of veterinary medicines to treat in the livestock WWTPs or be discharged into the water system in Korea since the sampling sites were widely distributed across the nation and samples were collected from the 11 livestock WWTPs. Nine antibiotics, two analgesics, and two disinfectants occurred in the livestock wastewater plants (WWTPs). From 11 livestock WWTP influents, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, acetylsalicylic acid, and disinfectants frequently occurred with the high concentrations. Meanwhile, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-H2O, and trimethoprim did not occur during sampling periods. The values for log Kow of each chemical showed a high correlation with the number of hydrogen bonding acceptors and were important parameters to estimate and understand the biodegradability and toxicity of a compound in the environment. The biodegradability of each compound was proportional to the hydrophilicity of each compound and the toxicity was proportional to the number of hydrogen bonding acceptors of each compound. The expected introductory concentration (EIC), predicted exposure concentration (PEC), and hazard quotient showed that the livestock WWTP effluents were hazardous to ecosystems.

AB We present herein the preparation of novel polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) containing insoluble -CD polymer as a carrier, polyvinyl chloride as a base polymer, and dibuthylphtalate (DBP) as a plasticizer in varying proportions. The prepared PIMs can be obtained by a simple, fast, and high-yield preparation process. Physicochemical characterizations of such membranes occurred in a homogeneous structure. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis found that DBP was inserted between these polymeric chains by non-covalent interactions. This led to a spacing of PVC/poly(-cyclodextrin) chains inducing a better access of guest molecules to PIM cyclodextrins. To achieve the elimination of ibuprofen and progesterone, two examples of emerging environmental contaminants that can lead to possible alterations to aquatic environments and affect human health, the effect of three operating parameters was studied (pH, the proportion of -cyclodextrin polymer, and wastewater agitation). The proportion of -cyclodextrin polymer and wastewater agitation had a favorable influence on drug extraction at 10 ppm. The PIMs containing -cyclodextrin polymer was unstable in basic conditions and was more effective at acidic pH. These initial results demonstrate the high potential for drug extraction of this polymer.

AB The occurrence of intersex fish, where male reproductive tissues show evidence of feminization, have been found in freshwater systems around the world, indicating the potential for significant endocrine disruption across species in the ecosystem. Estrogens from birth control medications in wastewater treatment plant effluent have been cited as the likely cause, but research has shown that endocrine disruption is not solely predictable based on hormone receptor interactions. Many other non-hormone pharmaceuticals are found in effluent at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than estrogens, yet there is little data indicating the impacts of these other medications. The widely prescribed anti-diabetic metformin is among the most abundant of pharmaceuticals found in effluent and is structurally dissimilar from hormones. However, we show here that exposing fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to a concentration of metformin found in wastewater effluent causes the development of intersex gonads in males, reduced size of treated male fish, and reduction in fecundity for treated pairs. Our results demonstrate that metformin acts as an endocrine disruptor at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ten low-order streams draining headwater catchments within the East Fork Little Miami Watershed were evaluated throughout one year for the presence of six steroidal hormones, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban, and the artificial sweetener sucralose. The wastewater management practices in the catchments included septic systems, sanitary sewers, a combination of both, and a parkland with no treatment systems. The concentrations and detection frequencies of sucralose showed a significant positive correlation with the septic density in each catchment. A similar relationship was found for sulfamethoxazole. Both sucralose and sulfamethoxazole are hydrophilic and unlikely to be removed effectively by sorption during septic treatment. The concentrations and detection frequencies of the antimicrobials were also positively correlated with septic density. The presence of the antimicrobials in the streams indicates that although they are hydrophobic, removal during septic treatment was incomplete. The target analytes that correlated with septic density were also detected in stream samples collected below a wastewater treatment plant located within the same watershed. The steroidal hormone estrone was the most frequently detected analyte at all sites. However, the estrone concentrations and detection frequencies did not correlate with the septic density due to multiple non-point sources.

AB Advanced treatment is increasingly being applied to improve abatement of micropollutants in wastewater effluent and reduce their load to surface waters. In this study, non-target screening of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data, collected at three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), was used to evaluate different advanced wastewater treatment setups, including (1) granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration alone, (2) pre-ozonation followed by GAC filtration, and (3) pre-ozonation followed by powdered activated carbon (PAC) dosed onto a sand filter. Samples were collected at each treatment step of the WWTP and analyzed with reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to HRMS. Each WWTP received a portion of industrial wastewater and a prioritization method was applied to select non-target features potentially resulting from industrial activities. Approximately 37,0 0 0 non-target features were found in the influents of the WWTPs. A number of non-target features (1207) were prioritized as likely of industrial origin and 54 were identified through database spectral matching. The fates of all detected non-target features were assessed through a novel automated trend assignment method. A trend was assigned to each non-target feature based on the normalized intensity profile for each sampling date. Results showed that 73 +/- 4% of influent non-target features and the majority of industrial features (89%) were well-removed (i.e., > 80% intensity reduction) during biological treatment in all three WWTPs. Advanced treatment removed, on average, an additional 11% of influent non-target features, with no significant differences observed among the different advanced treatment settings. In contrast, when considering a subset of 66 known micropollutants, advanced treatment was necessary to adequately abate these compounds and higher abatement was observed in fresh GAC (7,0 0 0-8,0 0 0 bed volumes (BVs)) compared to older GAC (18,0 0 0-48,0 0 0 BVs) (80% vs 56% of micropollutants were well-removed, respectively). Approximately half of the features detected in the WWTP effluents were features newly formed during the various treatment steps. In ozonation, between 1108-3579 features were classified as potential non-target ozonation transformation products (OTPs). No difference could be observed for their removal in GAC filters at the BVs investigated (70% of OTPs were well-removed on average). Similar amounts (67%) was observed with PAC (7.7-13.6 mg/L) dosed onto a sand filter, demonstrating that a post-treatment with activated carbon is efficient for the removal of OTPs.

AB This study investigated the impacts of selective sole carbon source-induced micropollutants (MPs) cometabolism of Chlorella sp. by: (i) extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), superoxide dismutase and peroxidase enzyme production; (ii) MPs removal efficiency and cometabolism rate; (iii) MPs' potential degradation products identification; and (iv) degradation pathways and validation using the Eawag database to differentiate the cometabolism of Chlorella sp. with other microbes. Adding the sole carbon sources in the presence of MPs increased EPS and enzyme concentrations from 2 to 100-fold in comparison with only sole carbon sources. This confirmed that MPs cometabolism had occurred. The removal efficiencies of tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and bisphenol A ranged from 16-99%, 32-92%, and 58-99%, respectively. By increasing EPS and enzyme activity, the MPs concentrations accumulated in microalgae cells also fell 400-fold. The cometabolism process resulted in several degradation products of MPs. This study drew an insightful understanding of cometabolism for MPs remediation in wastewater. Based on the results, proper carbon sources for microalgae can be selected for practical applications to remediate MPs in wastewater while simultaneously recovering biomass for several industries and gaining revenue.

AB The electrochemical oxidation of drug residues in hospital wastewater has been studied. Treatment performances were evaluated by measuring the residual concentrations of twelve pharmaceutical compounds from different categories (caffeine, cihydrocarbamazepine, desvenlafaxine, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen, carbamazepine, 4-hydroxy diclofenac, diclofenac, ibuprofen and clarithromycin). In order to follow the evolution of the treatment performances, high resolution mass spectrometry and spectral (UV-VIS and fluorescence) analysis were conducted and single correlations were proposed. Current densities were applied (4.42 mA.cm(-2), 17.7 mA.cm(-2) and 35.4 mA.cm(-2)) for a period of 120 min using boron-doped diamond (NB/ BDD) anode and titanium (Ti) cathode. Results showed that pollutants abatement rates in wastewater could reach 100% after 120 min at 35.4 mA.cm(-2). The UV254 absorbance and total fluorescence (TF) were applied as surrogate parameters in order to monitor the degradation of the targeted contaminants in hospital wastewater. For each molecule, single correlation (0543 < R-2 < 0944) were proposed for on-line monitoring in future works.

AB Global fresh water resources are under increasing pressure from rapidly growing demands and changing climatic conditions. Wastewater reclamation is becoming an important alternative for sustainable water resources management and building climate change resiliency in many regions around the world. Public acceptance and trust of consumers in the quality of reclaimed water is considered by many to be the most important factor determining the outcomes of water reclamation projects. Knowledge of the urban water cycle and water reuse perceptions of student, faculty and staff at Western University were investigated. Results showed that members of the university community are more likely to accept reclaimed wastewater for applications that do not involve drinking or close personal contact. Knowledge of the urban water cycle and water resources in Canada is modest among the university community with a moderate (G = 0.303, p< 0.05) positive relationship between 'water knowledge' and 'close contact acceptability'. The majority of the university community (75.8%) thinks that reclaiming water to provide an alternate source of water in southwestern Ontario is a good idea, but there are still concerns about the presence of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals from reclaimed water and the long-term effects on human health from exposure to these contaminants.

AB Industrial wastewater treatment for removal of small concentrations of harmful solvents is pertinent issue in many chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The present work evaluates removal of three common solvents by hydrodynamic cavitation (nominal capacity, 1m(3)/h). Solvent degradation of three solvents viz. octanol, dimethyl formamide and cyclohexanol was studied in the concentration range of 50-200 mg/L and for the pressure drop range of 0.5-5 bar. The vortex based cavitation device (vortex diode) was compared with that of linear flow based device (orifice). Process intensification in the form of aeration and addition oxidizing agent-hydrogen peroxide was also evaluated for synergistic effect. The vortex diode required lower pressure drop and is superior to orifice and process intensification using aeration is most effective. A reduction in TOC to the extent of 74% could be achieved for octanol (200 ppm) using aeration with cavitational yield of 1202x10(-4) mg/J for vortex diode, yield similar to 10 times of orifice. The degradation depends on the nature of solvent and it was revealed that low values of dielectric constant (epsilon<10) favour degradation. The kinetics was evaluated using rate model based on per-pass degradation factor. The process techno-economic feasibility is useful in industrial wastewater treatment.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewaters are recognized as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and also as hotspots for their horizontal gene transfer (HGT) using mobile genetic elements. Our study employed the use of PCR analysis of metagenomic DNA samples obtained from four pharmaceutical wastewaters using known primers to study the prevalence of thirty-six ARGs and four MGEs active against the commonly used antibiotics in Nigeria. The ARGs most frequently detected from the metagenomic DNA samples in each of the antibiotic classes under study include tetracycline [tet(G)], aminoglycoside [aadA, strA and strB], chloramphenicol [catA1], sulphonamides [sulI and sulII], and beta-lactams and penicillins [bla(OXA)]. The ARGs showed a 100% prevalence in their various environmental sources. The pharmaceutical facility PFIV showed the highest concentration of ARGs in this study. The highest concentration for MGEs was shown by pharmaceutical facility PFIII, positive for intl1, intl2, and IFS genes. This study highlights the wide distribution of ARGs to the antibiotics tested in the wastewater, making pharmaceutical wastewater reservoirs of ARGs which could potentially be transferred from commensal microorganisms to human pathogens.

AB Hollow fiber (HF) and flat sheet (FS) Sponge MBRs were operated at 10-20 LMH flux treating hospital wastewater. Simultaneous nitrification denitrification (SND) occurred considerably with TN removal rate of 0.011-0.020 mg TN mg VSS (1)d(1). Furthermore, there was a remarkable removal of antibiotics in both Sponge MBRs, namely Norfloxacin (93-99% (FS); 62-86% (HF)), Ofloxacin (73-93% (FS); 68-93% (HF)), Ciprofloxacin (76-93% (FS); 54-70% (HF)), Tetracycline (approximately 100% for both FS and HF) and Trimethoprim (60-97% (FS); 47-93% (HF). Whereas there was a quite high removal efficiency of Erythromycin in Sponge MBRs, with 67-78% (FS) and 22-48% (HF). Moreover, a slightly higher removal of antibiotics in FS than in HF achieved, with the removal rate being of 0.67-32.40 and 0.44-30.42 mg mg VSS (1)d(1), respectively. In addition, a significant reduction of membrane fouling of 2-50 times was achieved in HF-Sponge MBR for the flux range. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutical products are bioactive compounds designed to pose therapeutic effects on living systems. In lieu with the increasing global usage of these products ranging from perfumes to analgesics, numerous tests have evidenced an alarming rise of concentration in water runoffs, despite various secondary water treatment steps. Therefore, in order to ensure that water is safe for consumption, tertiary treatment is devised for the efficient removal of pharmaceuticals. More recently; the incorporation of advanced materials into conventional techniques has been deemed as a prospective alternative as they circumvent some of the major drawbacks. Various forms of advanced materials that have been studied include polymers (e.g., dendrimers), inorganics (e.g., carbon nanotubes, TiO2), semiconductors, zero-valence metals (e.g., Fe2O3), and composite membranes. By virtue of its vast variety, the compilation and review of this information are vital to enable comparison of their performance. Here, we present a summarized critical review on these advanced materials in the removal of pharmaceutical products in water. Based on their properties and applications, the main objective of using advanced material is then to reduce the cost and ineffectiveness of conventional wastewater treatment processes.

AB Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem that is both pressing and challenging due to the rate at which it is spreading, and the lack of understanding of the mechanisms that link human, animal and environmental sources contributing to its proliferation. One knowledge gap that requires immediate attention is the significance of antimicrobial residues and other pharmaceuticals that are being discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) on the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. In this work we provide an approach to develop a harmonized analytical method for 8 classes of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals that can be used for global monitoring in wastewater and receiving waters. Analysis of these trace organic chemicals in the influent and effluent wastewater, and in the respective upstream and downstream receiving waters from different countries across the globe is not trivial. Here, we demonstrated that sample preparation using solid-phase extraction (SPE) not only provides a convenient and cost-effective shipping of samples, but also adds stability to the analytes during international shipping. It is important that SPE cartridges are maintained at cold temperature during shipment if the duration is longer than 7 days because a significant decrease in recoveries were observed after 7 days in the cartridges stored at room temperature, especially for sulfonamides and tetracyclines. To compensate for sample degradation during shipment, and matrix effects in liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry, the use of stable isotope labeled compounds should be employed when available and affordable. The importance of applying a defined tolerance for the ion ratios (Q/q) that have been optimized for wastewater and surface water is discussed. The tolerance range was set to be the mean Q/q of the analyte standard at various concentrations +/- 40% for the influent, and +/- 30% for the effluent, upstream, and downstream samples; for tetracyclines and quinolones, however, the tolerance range was +/- 80% in order to minimize false negative and false positive detection. The optimized procedures were employed to reveal differences in antimicrobial and pharmaceutical concentrations in influent, effluent, and surface water samples from Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. The antimicrobials with the highest concentrations in influent and effluent samples were ciprofloxacin (48,103 ng/L, Hong Kong WWTP 1) and clarithromycin (5178 ng/L, India WWTP 2), respectively. On the other hand, diclofenac (108,000 ng/L, Sweden WWTP 2), caffeine (67,000 ng/L, India WWTP 1), and acetaminophen (28,000 ng/L, India WWTP 1) were the highest detected pharmaceuticals in the receiving surface water samples. Hong Kong showed the highest total antimicrobial concentrations that included macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonamides with concentrations reaching 60,000 ng/L levels in the influent. Antidepressants were predominant in Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.

AB Pharmaceutical products are widely consumed globally and are commonly found in wastewaters as a result of constant excretion and disposal into sewers. The present study proposes an efficient binary solvent dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (BS-DLLME) method that was developed for preconcentration of 7 nervous system drug active compounds from aqueous media for their determination at trace levels by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The drug analytes included 3 antidepressants, 2 antipsychotics, 1 antiepileptic, and 1 antidementia. Optimum conditions of the BS-DLLME method were acquired by univariate optimization of parameters including type of binary solvents, ratio of binary solvents, type of disperser solvent, volume of binary solvents, and volume of disperser solvent. Detection and quantification limits were calculated in the range of 0.28 to 6.5 mu g/L. Municipal wastewater, medical wastewater, synthetic domestic wastewater, and lake water were utilized as real samples in spike recovery experiments; and the results (94-106%) indicated the method's applicability and accuracy at quantifying the analytes in complex matrices.

AB Today, pharmaceuticals are considered as one of the sources of water pollution, among which antibiotics have complicated structure and antibacterial property, so they cannot be removed from water by common treatment methods. Tetracycline is an antibiotic which is used to treat humans and infected animals. Photocatalytic degradation is an effective method which is used for the removal of antibiotics from water. In this work, brass foils were coated by lanthanum oxide using dipping method. The coated foils were calcined; nanowires grew, so lanthanum oxide was sintered to the brass nanowires. The prepared photocatalyst was characterized by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and porosimetry techniques. The photocatalytic degradation operating conditions including pH, initial concentration of tetracycline wastewater, and time were modeled and optimized by Design Expert software (version 10). The La2O3/brass photocatalyst was active under irradiation of ultraviolet, LED, and sunlight. The maximum tetracycline photodegradation yield was 89.97% obtained by La2O3/brass foil with the dimensions of 1 cm x 3 cm, 100 mL of tetracycline solution with the concentration of 5 mg/L and pH of 10 under ultraviolet irradiation for 120 min.

Concentrations of aldehydes and carboxylic acids generated via the oxidation of EfOM were also determined. The absorbance and fluorescence of ozonated wastewater decreased with increasing ozone dose or treatment time. HPSEC data showed that these phenomena corresponded to the oxidation of all EfOM fractions, with some preference towards the degradation of the EfOM molecules with high apparent molecular weight. The removal of antibiotics and production of aldehydes and carboxylic acids were strongly correlated with the changes in both EfOM absorbance and fluorescence. Applications of a model describing the concurrent degradation of trace level contaminants and relative changes of EfOM emission allowed achieving a good fitting between the experimental and modeled Delta C/C-0 vs. Delta A/A(0) and Delta C/C-0, vs. Delta F/F-0 data.

DT Article
DE Ag-TiO2; carbamazepine; photocatalytic operating conditions; response
   surface methodology; photocatalytical degradation
AB Carbamazepine as a typical ingredient in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) cannot be removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes due to its biorefractory property. In this paper, the effects of photocatalytic operating conditions of wastewater treatment such as stirring speed, composite material dosage, light intensity, and irradiation time on the degradation of carbamazepine by ATC were studied. Considering the aspects of technology, economy, and environment, the photocatalytic process scheme was optimized for carbamazepine wastewater treatment using ATC. The results were analyzed and simulated by response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of various factors and their interactions on the treatment efficiency were analyzed using a multiple quadratic regression equation, by which the optimal process parameters and the process conditions with optimal response were achieved. Under low material dosage (less than 2 g/L), the pair-wise interactions among irradiation time, light intensity, and stirring speed contributed more to the treatment efficiency than medium (2 g/L to 4 g/L) or high (more than 4 g/L) material dosage. The operation cost under low material dosage was relatively low, which shows that material cost is one of the most important factors in the actual photocatalytic process.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are only partially removed by convectional wastewater treatment plants. This study aimed at assessing the post-treatment degradation of selected antibiotics and antiretroviral drugs by direct UV photolysis and advanced oxidation processes (UV/H(2)O(2)and UV/Cl-2) using low-pressure mercury lamp. The rate of degradation largely followed pseudo first-order reaction kinetics. Amongst the six studied APIs, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and zidovudine were readily degraded by more than 90% using direct UV photolysis. Addition of Cl(2)and H(2)O(2)to the UV process led to an increase in the rate of degradation for all the compounds. The effectiveness UV/Cl(2)process was affected to a greater extent by the background effluent organic matter. This implies that higher electrical energy and oxidant would be required in the UV/Cl(2)process relative to UV/H(2)O(2)process. Generally, electrical energy required to remove 90% of the target compounds increased in the order UV/H2O2< UV/Cl-2 < UV processes.

AB The enzymatic factory of ligninolytic fungi has proven to be a powerful tool in applications regarding the degradation of various types of pollutants. The degradative potential of fungi is mainly due to the production of different types of oxidases, of which laccases is one of the most prominent enzymatic activities. In the present work, crude laccases from the supernatant of Pleurotus citrinopileatus cultures grown in olive oil mill wastewater (OOMW) were immobilized in crosslinked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), aiming at the development of biocatalysts suitable for the enzymatic treatment of OOMW. The preparation of laccase CLEAs was optimized, resulting in a maximum of 72% residual activity. The resulting CLEAs were shown to be more stable in the presence of solvents and at elevated temperatures compared to the soluble laccase preparation. The removal of the phenolic component of OOMW catalyzed by laccase-CLEAs exceeded 35%, while they were found to retain their activity for at least three cycles of repetitive use. The described CLEAs can be applied for the pretreatment of OOMW, prior to its use for valorization processes, and thus, facilitate its complete biodegradation towards a consolidated process in the context of circular economy.

AB Bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were transplanted to 18 locations representing a range of potential exposures throughout Puget Sound, WA. Tissues were analyzed for over 200 organic contaminants. Results indicated the widespread exposure of marine organisms to trace levels of organic contaminants including the synthetic opioid oxycodone, present at three urban sites, and the chemotherapy drug melphalan, present at nine locations, at levels that may be of biological concern.
   Land-use and wastewater outfalls were evaluated as potential sources of CECs to the nearshore. Exposure to alkylphenol ethoxylates was associated with increased impervious surfaces in upland watersheds. A hydrodynamic simulation was performed using the Salish Sea Model to integrate inputs from 99 wastewater sources to Puget Sound. Predictions were consistent with concentrations of several wastewater-associated contaminants and delta N-15 enrichment. These results support the notion that Puget Sound nearshore biota suffer chronic exposures to a suite of contaminants from multiple sources and provide critical to focus future monitoring and management.

AB Fenton processes are promising wastewater treatment alternatives for bio-recalcitrant compounds. Three different methods (i.e., reverse microemulsion, sol-gel, and combustion) were designed to synthesize environmentally friendly ferrites as magnetically recoverable catalysts to be applied for the decomposition of two pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and carbamazepine) that are frequently detected in water bodies. The catalysts were used in a heterogeneous solar photo-Fenton treatment to save the cost of applying high-energy UV radiation sources, and was performed under a slightly basic pH to avoid metal leaching and adding salts for pH adjustment. All the developed catalysts resulted in the effective treatment of ciprofloxacin and carbamazepine in both synthetic and real domestic wastewater. In particular, the sol-gel synthesized ferrite was more magnetic and more suitable for reuse. The degradation pathways of both compounds were elucidated for this treatment. The degradation of ciprofloxacin involved attacks to the quinolone and piperazine rings. The degradation pathway of carbamazepine involved the formation of hydroxyl carbamazepine and dihydroxy carbamazepine before yielding acridine by hydrogen abstraction, decarboxylation, and amine cleavage, which would be further oxidized.

The average of total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) removal efficiencies during four Runs were 96.5% and 98.7%. Meanwhile, biological removal contributions were 74.3% and 78%, the rest part was attributed by the physical removal process of the membrane block, VFA (Volatile Fatty Acids) and alpha value (VFA/alkalinity) increased with the increase of CFV, resulted alkalinity decreased. Biomass concentration mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) as well as the polysaccharide increased smoothly in the suspended sludge with the CFV increasing, and the protein content decreased gradually. However, the concentration of biomass, polysaccharide and protein presented opposite trends in the attached sludge of the membrane. The results indicated that AnMBR can effectively treat the antibiotic solvent wastewater under high CFV. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study focuses on the effects of organic loading rate (OLR) on the removal of N,N-Dimethylforma: mide(DMF), m-Cresol (MC) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) by a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for treating chemical synthesis-based antibiotic solvent wastewater at period of improved influent COD concentration with decreased HRT. The whole process was divided into five stages in terms of the variation of OLR ranging from 3.9 to 12.7 kg COD/(m(3).d). During 249 days of operating time, the average DMF, MC, IPA removal efficiency were 96.9%,98.2% and 96.4%, respectively. Cake layer was accumulated on the membrane surface acted as a dynamic secondary biofilm which lead to the increase of physical removal rate. In addition, mathematical statistical models was built on the linear regression techniques for exploring the inner relationship between EPS and the performance of the AnMBR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the rejection of trace antibiotics from wastewater using forward osmosis (FO), spacer was added over the membrane to regulate the operation conditions. Interesting results were obtained, which demonstrated that when the spacer was added over the FO membrane, rejections of trace antibiotics increased by 23-2.8% in the active layer facing feed solution (AL-FS) orientation. Similarly, in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) orientation, rejections of antibiotics increased by 5.3-8.5% after the spacer being added. To explore the mechanism of the enhancement for antibiotic rejections, the flow field in the FO cell was investigated using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) technology. It was confirmed that turbulence was produced in the FO cell due to the added spacer. And it was proposed that the turbulence could disturb the boundary layer at the membrane surface and urge the antibiotics to diffuse from the layer back into the bulk solution, which reduced the diffusive driving force of antibiotics through the membrane into the draw solution, hence leading to an increase in rejections.

AB An increasing number of reports on plant uptake of pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) have been recently published, raising concerns of human exposure through dietary intake. In this study, PC uptake and translocation were evaluated in cucumber and tomato plants to elucidate the effects of PC physicochemical properties, soil type, and irrigation-water quality. Nonionic PCs were taken up and accumulated at higher levels in plants grown in soils of lower organic matter and clay content. While the concentration of most PCs in cucumber and tomato leaves were of similar order, their concentrations in the tomato fruit were much lower than in the cucumber fruit. This is related to differences in fruit physiology. Our data suggest that irrigation with treated wastewater reduces the bioavailability of acidic PCs for uptake by cucumber plants as compared to fresh water irrigation. This study sheds light on factors affecting the uptake of PCs by crops irrigated with treated wastewater, the governing role of PCs' physicochemical properties along with the physiological nature of the plant, soil properties and water quality that together determine uptake, translocation, and accumulation within plant organs. Occurrence of metabolites in plant suggests that PC metabolism has to be evaluated to reveal the total uptake.

AB The algal growth responses to the effluents of an aluminum plating plant and to the wastewater from an analgesic/ antiinflammatory-drug-producing pharmaceutical plant were investigated. Growth response of the marine alga Dunaliella tertiolecta was monitored by measuring the two response parameters optical density (OD640) and in vitro chlorophyll fluorescence for a period of 14 days. Generally, the two response measurements gave similar results for all effluents but the raw effluents of the aluminum plating plant due to the composition of the wastewater. All wastes affected algal growth either by inhibition only or by stimulation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. Since pollutant tolerance of algae biased toxicity test results, acclimation of algae to the raw effluent of the aluminum plating plant was examined. Although the water quality parameters of treated effluent of both plants were in the permitted range reported by the Turkish Water Pollution Control Act, they inhibited growth at higher concentrations, implying that the two treatment plants were inefficient. Therefore, the importance of toxicity tests in wastewater discharge regulations was emphasized. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment is a topic of primary interest with regard to the environment. Diclofenac is a common analgesic drug often detected in wastewater and surface water. In this paper, three commonly available agrifood waste types (artichoke agrowaste, olive-mill residues, and citrus waste) were reused as sorbents of diclofenac present in aqueous effluents. Citrus-waste biomass for a dose of 2 g center dot L-1 allowed for removing 99.7% of diclofenac present in the initial sample, with a sorption capacity of 9 mg of adsorbed diclofenac for each gram of used biomass. The respective values obtained for olive-mill residues and artichoke agrowaste were around 4.15 mg center dot g(-1). Advanced oxidation processes with UV/H2O2 and UV/HOCl were shown to be effective treatments for the elimination of diclofenac. A significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD; 40-48%) was also achieved with these oxidation treatments. Despite the lesser effectiveness of the sorption process, it should be considered that the reuse and valorization of these lignocellulosic agrifood residues would facilitate the fostering of a circular economy.

AB This study presents a novel statistical approach for identifying sequenced chemical transformation pathways in combination with reaction kinetics models. The proposed method relies on sound uncertainty propagation by considering parameter ranges and associated probability distribution obtained at any given transformation pathway levels as priors for parameter estimation at any subsequent transformation levels. The method was applied to calibrate a model predicting the transformation in untreated wastewater of six biomarkers, excreted following human metabolism of heroin and codeine. The method developed was compared to parameter estimation methods commonly encountered in literature (i.e., estimation of all parameters at the same time and parameter estimation with fix values for upstream parameters) by assessing the model prediction accuracy, parameter identifiability and uncertainty analysis. Results obtained suggest that the method developed has the potential to outperform conventional approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, transformation pathway identification and parameter identifiability. This method can be used in conjunction with optimal experimental designs to effectively identify model structures and parameters. This method can also offer a platform to promote a closer interaction between analytical chemists and modellers to identify models for biochemical transformation pathways, being a prominent example for the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology.

AB Municipal wastewater contains a number of harmful chemicals whose concentrations can fluctuate dramatically. Therefore studying concentrations of harmful chemicals by conventional grab water sampling can give a misleading picture of the true chemical contents. In grab samples the contents can often remain below the quantification limit which does not necessary mean the compound is not present in the aquatic environment but rather implies unsuccessful timing of sampling or limited sample volume. Alternative techniques are needed to improve the reliability of monitoring harmful chemicals and thus in this study the presence of organotin compounds (OTCs) was monitored at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with Chemcatcher (R) passive sampling. Extreme conditions complicate the passive sampling, particularly in influent stream. However, the OTC concentrations determined with passive samplers were similar with those measured from grab samples. In conclusion, fewer OTCs were found with grab sampling than with passive sampling, particularly in effluent. The passive samplers seemed to be more suitable than grab samples for monitoring OTCs in wastewaters. As long-term sampling techniques give a more representative picture of the true chemical contents, passive sampling should be considered as an emerging tool for environmental authorities to implement the monitoring of harmful chemicals at WWTP.

In treatment plant, the parameters such as BOD5, NH3, PO43-, SS, MLVSS, pH, temperature, sludge volume and microorganisms predominance are studied, under constant sedimentation time (30 min) against variable aeration times. As a second step, the same parameters are studied under the constant aeration time (4 h) against variable sedimentation times. Effluent concentrations from sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are determined BOD5 = 13-18 mg L-1, COD = 25-37 mg L-1, SS = 9-21 mg L-1, pH = 7.3-7.6, TDF = 1-2, T = 23degreesC, NH3 = 1 mg L-1, PO43- = 8.1 mg L-1. At the end of 6 h of aeration time, the efficiency of BOD5 reaches to 83%. The efficiency of BOD5 reaches to 81% under a 4 h aeration time and at 90 min sedimentation time. As a result, the optimum treatment efficiency has been taken under 4 h of aeration time and of 60 min of sedimentation time.

AB Pollutants such as pharmaceutical products and pesticides are still present in treated water. Several of these compounds are photoactive. The photodegradation of eight organic pollutants was studied using listed advanced oxidation processes: UV/H2O2, UV/persulfate, Fenton, photo-Fenton and UV/TiO2. The results show that photodegradation is most effective in the first 10 min of treatments in simulated urban wastewater collected from the local Nisava River. To identify the correlation between applied degradation processes as well as the relationship among the structure of investigated compounds and efficiency of degradation, Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed. The established correlations between the applied processes, as well as the determination of the influence of the structure on the efficiency of degradation, enable a more efficient choice of the degradation procedure, especially in the case of interference. Additionally, process electrical energy consumption and treatment costs for simulated urban wastewater with different pharmaceuticals and pesticides were determined.

AB A series of visible-light-driven direct Z-scheme CdS/CuInS2 nanoplates were fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method, and the molar ratio of CdS to CuInS2 was optimized. The highest visible-light photocatalytic degradation activity of Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction is about 4 times than that of pure CuInS2, which is due to the narrowest band gap, the largest BET surface area, the most efficient charge separation and transfer, and the synergistic effect between CdS and CuInS2. Meanwhile, Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction also exhibits excellent photocatalytic reduction activity with almost 100% of aqueous Cr (VI) reduction efficiency in absence of hole scavengers after 60 min. The special significance is that Z-scheme (1: 0.03) CdS/CuInS2 heterojunction shows excellent stability in five degradation cycles, and can effectively treat real pharmaceutical wastewater with 76.5% COD removal efficiency with aid of H2O2 in 13 h, indicating that Z-scheme CdS/CuInS2 has a promising prospect in real pharmaceutical wastewater treatment.

AB The removal of organic micropollutants (OMPs) has been investigated in constructed wetlands (CWs) operated as bioelectrochemical systems (BES). The operation of CWs as BES (CW-BES), either in the form of microbial fuel cells (MFC) or microbial electrolysis cells (MEC), has only been investigated in recent years. The presented experiment used CW meso-scale systems applying a realistic horizontal flow regime and continuous feeding of real urban wastewater spiked with four OMPs (pharmaceuticals), namely carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBU) and naproxen (NPX). The study evaluated the removal efficiency of conventional CW systems (CW-control) as well as CW systems operated as closed-circuit MFCs (CW-MFCs) and MECs (CW-MECs). Although a few positive trends were identified for the CW-BES compared to the CW-control (higher average CBZ, DCF and NPX removal by 10-17% in CW-MEC and 5% in CW-MFC), these proved to be not statistically significantly different. Mesoscale experiments with real wastewater could thus not confirm earlier positive effects of CW-BES found under strictly controlled laboratory conditions with synthetic wastewaters.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been suggested as reservoirs and sources of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. In a WWTP ecosystem, human enteric and environmental bacteria are mixed and exposed to pharmaceutical residues, potentially favoring genetic exchange and thus ARG transmission. However, the contribution of microbial communities in WWTPs to ARG dissemination remains poorly understood. Here, we examined for the first time plasmid permissiveness of an activated sludge microbial community by utilizing an established fluorescent bioreporter system. The activated sludge microbial community was challenged in standardized filter matings with one of three multidrug resistance plasmids (pKJKS, pB10, and RP4) harbored by Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida. Different donor-plasmid combinations had distinct transfer frequencies, ranging from 3 to SO conjugation events per 100000 cells of the WWTP microbial community. In addition, transfer was observed to a broad phylogenetic range of 13 bacterial phyla with several taxa containing potentially pathogenic species. Preferential transfer to taxa belonging to the predicted evolutionary host range of the plasmids was not observed. Overall, the ARG dissemination potential uncovered in WWTP communities calls for a thorough risk assessment of ARG transmission across the wastewater system, before identification of possible mitigation strategies.

AB Pharmaceuticals are environmental micropollutants that pose an emerging challenge because they are poorly eliminated in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Over the last decade, many attempts have been made to solve this problem, and wastewater fungal treatment is a promising alternative. In this study, six different ligninolytic fungi (Trametes versicolor, Ganoderma lucidum, Irpex lacteus, Stropharia rugosoannulata, Gymnopilus luteofolius and Agrocybe erebia) were studied as bioremediation candidates for the removal and degradation of six recalcitrant pharmaceutical micropollutants: Carbamazepine (CBZ), Venlafaxine (VFX), lopromide (IPD), Diclofenac (DCF), Cyclophosphamide (CFD) and Ifosfamide (IFD). Self-immobilization in a pellet shape was achieved for all fungal mycelia (which was the first time that this was reported for S. rugosoannulata, G. luteofolius, and A. erebia). Biodegradation achievement was greater than 90% for IPD with G. luteofolius and greater than 70% for CBZ with S. rugosoannulata, which suggests a great potential for this alternative biological treatment. Besides, this was the first report where fungal treatment achieved CFD and IFD removals greater than 20% for the treatment with T. versicolor, G. lucidum and S. rugosoannulata. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Amide pharmaceuticals cannot be removed easily in conventional wastewater treatment processes, and the dosage of redox mediators may enhance their removals under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic batch experiments were carried out for the removals of amide pharmaceuticals with the dosage of ferroferric oxide or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. Factors of redox mediators, organic carbon and steps of anaerobic treatment on the removals of amide pharmaceuticals were evaluated. For primidone, carbamazepine and crotamiton, their removals were poor during anaerobic treatment, and the addition of redox mediators enhanced their removals. For sulfamethoxazole, it was effectively removed by anaerobic treatment (above 90%) and the dosage of redox mediator accelerated its removal. The cooperation of carbon source and redox mediators accelerated the removals of amide pharmaceuticals, but the types of organic carbon had little influence on the anaerobic degradation of amide pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the hydrolysis/acidification step contributed significantly to the removal of amide pharmaceuticals during anaerobic treatment. For the control of amide pharmaceuticals in wastewater, the incorporation of anaerobic process into the wastewater treatment stream is a valuable strategy, especially with the dosage of redox mediators.

The reaction kinetics and reaction rate constant were C/N ratio-, SMX concentration-, and dissolved oxygen concentration-dependent, and the highest reaction rate constant for SMX biodegradation was 0.0384 min(-1). Gaseous compounds analysis and Nap gene amplification analysis by gas chromatography (GC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, showed N-2 as an end product during nitrogen conversion. Moreover, toxicity assays were conducted by the inhibition percentage (PI) and agar well diffusion methods. The toxicity of the medium gradually decreased, falling within the nontoxic range after 96 h. The present study showed that biological technologies could be an effective, economical, and environmentally friendly remediation against pharmaceutical pollutants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbamazepine is one of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and has been widely used to treat depression and seizures, and it cannot be effectively removed during the conventional wastewater treatment processes. In this study, three processes were used for the carbamazepine degradation, including single radiation, radiation in the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and radiation followed by PMS oxidation. The results show that radiation in the presence of PMS could enhance the degradation and mineralization of carbamazepine, decreasing the absorbed dose required for completely degrading carbamazepine from 800 Gy to 300 Cy, no matter what the molar ratio of PMS to carbamazepine was. The radiation followed by PMS oxidation significantly increased the mineralization, and the maximum mineralization achieved 46.5% at the dose of 600 Cy. Eight intermediates were tentatively identified. Compared to single radiation process, the radiation in the presence of PMS enhanced the transformation of intermediates and the release of ammonium ion. In real wastewater, the radiation in the presence of PMS could effectively remove carbamazepine and considerably decreased the biological toxicity of the wastewater containing carbamazepine.

AB Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a type of wastewater posing large problems when discharged in the environment. Yet, due to its high nutrient content, POME may offer opportunities for algal growth and subsequent harvesting of high-value products. The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a potential feedstock diatom for bioactive compounds such as the carotenoid fucoxanthin, which has been shown to have pharmaceutical applications. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the growth and fucoxanthin productivity of P. tricornutum grown on POME, as a function of light intensity, temperature, salinity, and nutrient enrichment. High-saturating irradiance (300molphotonsm(-2)s(-1)) levels at 25 degrees C showed highest growth rates but decreased the fucoxanthin productivity of P. tricornutum. Box-Behnken response surface methodology revealed that the optimum fucoxanthin productivity was influenced by temperature, salinity, and the addition of urea. Nutrient enrichment by phosphorus did not enhance cell density and fucoxanthin productivity, while urea addition was found to stimulate both. We conclude that POME wastewater, supplemented with urea, can be considered as the potential medium for P. tricornutum to replace commercial nutrients while producing high amounts of fucoxanthin.

AB In this study, three novel multi-sparger multi-stage airlift loop membrane bioreactors (Ms(2)ALMBRs) were set up in parallel for treating synthetic high-strength 7-ACA pharmaceutical wastewater under different HRTs, temperatures and pHs, respectively. During the 200-day operating time, average COD removal efficiencies were 94.96%, 96.05% and 93.9%. While average 7-ACA removal efficiencies were 66.44%, 59.04% and 59.60%, respectively. The optimal conditions were 10 h, 15-35 degrees C and 7-9 for HRT, temperature and pH, respectively. Moreover, the sludge characteristics and microorganism drug-resistances were explored. Results showed that different temperatures and pHs influenced contaminant removals by affecting MLSS concentration and beta-lactamase activity significantly. In addition, mathematical statistical models, built on the polynomial and linear regression techniques, were developed for exploring the inner relationships between HRT, temperature and pH changes and MLSS concentrations, beta-lactamase activities and contaminant removals of the Ms(2)ALMBR system.

AB Conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants are not able to entirely degrade some organic pollutants that end up in the environment. Within this group of contaminants, Emerging Contaminants are mostly unregulated compounds that may be candidates for future regulation. In this work, different advanced technologies: solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2, solar photo-Fenton and ozonation, are studied as tertiary treatments for the remediation of micropollutants present in real municipal wastewater treatment plants effluents at pilot plant scale. Contaminants elimination was followed by Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole ion trap Mass Spectrometry analysis after a pre-concentration 100:1 by automatic solid phase extraction. 66 target micropollutants were identified and quantified. 16 of those contaminants at initial concentrations over 1000 ng L-1, made up over 88% of the initial total effluent pollutant load. The order of micropollutants elimination efficiency under the experimental conditions evaluated was solar photo-Fenton > zonation > solar heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2. Toxicity analyses by Vibrio fischeri and respirometric tests showed no significant changes in the effluent toxicity after the three tertiary treatments application. Solar photo-Fenton and ozonation treatments were also compared from an economical point of view. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In energy-efficient electrodialysis desalination processes, salt ions are transported from seawater (high salinity) to wastewater (low salinity) through ion-exchange membranes. Besides salt ions, also organic micropollutants can be transported from wastewater (high in organics) to seawater (low in organics). The transport mechanisms of organic micropollutants through ion-exchange membranes are complex phenomena, and pH has a tremendous impact on them. Since pH variations in electrodialysis operation are common, it is of crucial importance to investigate its influence on these mechanisms. Therefore, a large pool of nineteen organic micropollutants of various physicochemical characteristics was selected and added to artificial wastewater, at environmentally relevant concentrations. Approximately twenty of these physicochemical properties were statistically analyzed to elucidate the dominant mechanisms affecting adsorption and transport of organic micropollutants as a function of pH. Additionally, the influence of different current densities on the transport of organic micropollutants at different pH conditions was studied. This pH effect has now been investigated for the very first time, leading to essential conclusions on the practical applicability of electrodialysis for seawater desalination. The presented findings advance our understanding of the type of interactions between organic micropollutants and ion-exchange membranes.

AB Biological treatment for volatile organic compound (VOC)-contaminated wastewater with conventional aeration methods causes significant stripping loss of pollutants due to its high volatility. To overcome this problem, the membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was developed. The aim of this study was to reduce acetonitrile (ACN) stripping loss during the aeration process and to evaluate MABR performance under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and ACN surface loading rates. The MABR was operated with an inlet ACN concentration of 300mg/L at four HRT conditions-4, 6, 9, and 12 h. Experimental results indicated that nearly 49% of ACN was stripped due to mechanical aeration, whereas stripping loss due to MABR was approximately 0.1%. A HRT of 6 h was found to be the optimum condition with removal efficiencies of ACN, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total nitrogen (TN) at 98%, 87%, 84%, and 69%, respectively. This MABR could achieve removal of ACN with a maximum surface loading rate and removal capacity of 3.75 and 3.63g/m(2)center dot day, respectively. This study therefore established improved MABR efficiency with shorter HRT requirements.

AB Phytoremediation has been applied for treating an extensive range of environmental contaminants such as anti-diabetic drug metformin which is increasingly found as environmental contaminant. These contaminants are released to the environment via human and veterinary medicine and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, native plant capabilities for uptake of metformin from wastewater were investigated. Moreover, uptake rate of metformin was studied in two different concentrations of 20 and 50 mg l(-1) metformin solution by Amaranthus retroflexus, Ricinus communis, Brassica napus, Celosia cristata, Helianthus annuus and Phragmites australis. The results showed that after exposing to 20 mg l(-1) metformin solution 69.53 +/- 2.25% of metformin was remediated by H. annuus plants. Also in 50 mg l(-1) metformin solution, H. annuus plants showed the most remediation potential (65.7 +/- 1%). Metformin uptake is raised by B. napus and C. cristata plants along with increasing metformin concentration. There was no evidence of the presence of metformin in the roots and shoots of R. communis and C. cristata. The results also indicated that plants such as H. annuus can be a potential candidate for uptake of metformin from wastewater.

AB Application of subcritical and supercritical water technology for destruction of pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole) was investigated. The experiments were conducted inside batch reactor at a temperature ranging from 473 to 773 K and with different residence times of 5 to 50 min. The results show that carbamazepine, metoprolol and sulfamethaxazole are destructed by 90.27%, 99.99% and 98.84% after a 20 min exposure to 623 K, 673 K and 573 K, respectively. In comparison with the conventional methods of pharmaceutical waste treatment, the current technology provides a higher destruction efficiency (approximately 90-100%) which is achievable in shorter durations. NaOH and CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O were also applied as catalysts in the temperature range of 473 K to 723 K. Comparing these catalysts, CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O demonstrates a higher destruction efficiency, especially at lower temperatures. Based on the proposed pathway, the products of destructioncan be classified as environmentally-friendly compounds. The results show that this technology can be used as a green alternative for efficient removal of pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater streams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are commonly found both in the aquatic and the agricultural environments as a consequence of the human activities and associated discharge of wastewater effluents to the environment. The utilization of treated effluent for crop irrigation, along with land application of manure and biosolids, accelerates the introduction of these compounds into arable lands and crops. Despite the low concentrations of pharmaceuticals usually found, the continuous introduction into the environment from different pathways makes them 'pseudo-persistent'. Several reviews have been published regarding the potential impact of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals on arable land. However, plant uptake as well as phytotoxicity data are scarcely studied. Simultaneously, phytoremediation as a tool for pharmaceutical removal from soils, sediments and water is starting to be researched, with promising results. This review gives an in-depth overview of the phytotoxicity of pharmaceuticals, their uptake and their removal by plants. The aim of the current work was to map the present knowledge concerning pharmaceutical interactions with plants in terms of uptake and the use of plant-based systems for phytoremediation purposes.

AB The combined polyferric sulfate (PT-S) coagulation with Fenton-like was investigated for treating nondegradable antibiotic fermentation wastewater. The experimental results indicated that 62.2% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 66.7% of color were removed, under the optimum conditions of coagulant dosage 200 mg/L, stirring time 12 min, and settling time 1 h. From the PFS characterization by means of Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope, it was believed that PFS coagulation was a mechanism including adsorption, neutralization of charged particles, and bridging between colloid particles. In addition, optimal conditions of Fenton-like process were determined to be H2O2 dosage of 150 mg/L and oxalic acid of 45 mg/L. With effluents of Fenton-like being controlled atpH 7.0, the pollutants could be coagulated further. The hydroxyl radicals measurement by means of electron paramagnetic resonance showed that Fenton-like system could produce more HO center dot than did photo-Fenton system. The total removal efficiencies of COD and color could reach 93.5 and 96.7%, respectively. (C) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 29: 42-51, 2010

AB This study examined the biodegradation potential of three wastewater micropollutants (triclosan, bisphenol A, and ibuprofen) by Nitrosomonas europoea and mixed ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in nitrifying activated sludge. N. europaea could degrade triclosan and bisphenol A, but not ibuprofen. The degradation was observed only in the absence of allylthiourea (an inhibitor for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO)), suggesting that AMO might be responsible for triclosan and bisphenol A degradation. Competitive inhibition among ammonia, triclosan, and bisphenol A was observed. Inactivation of N. europaea was observed after degrading a mixture of triclosan and bisphenol A. The inactivation might be due to product toxicity and/or antimicrobial effect of triclosan: however, the causes of the inactivation were not determined.
   Regardless of the presence of the AMO inhibitor, three micropollutants were degraded by two different nitrified activated sludge samples. The results suggested that both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms in the activated sludge can degrade triclosan and bisphenol A. On the other hand, ibuprofen was more likely degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms in the activated sludge. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFCWs) are a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for sanitation in small communities. SSFCWs are designed to remove suspended solids and organic matter from wastewater but there is little information on the effect of the characteristics of organic matter on the removal efficiency of specific contaminants. In this paper, carbamazepine, ibuprofen and clofibric acid were continuously injected into two SSFCW microcosms fed with synthetic wastewater containing different organic matter sources: dissolved (glucose) and particulate (starch). The response curves of carbamazepine and ibuprofen were compared with that of clofibric acid, which was used as a conservative tracer. The removal efficiencies were found to be independent of the organic matter type (i.e. dissolved or particulate). Carbamazepine was removed inefficiently (5%) by bed sorption, whereas ibuprofen was removed by degradation (51%). In addition, the behaviour of the two main ibuprofen biodegradation intermediates (carboxy and hydroxy derivatives) supported that the main ibuprofen elimination pathway occurs in aerobic conditions.

AB While wastewater treatment plants have been identified as the most prominent source of emerging micropollutants in surface waters, prediction of their ambient concentrations remains a challenge. This is due to the variability of loads entering individual treatment plants and of the elimination capacity by the latter as well as potential attenuation in the river network. Although geospatially detailed models exist, they suffer from the same data input uncertainties. Here, we investigated the concentration profiles of 20 emerging pollutants in different river stretches in Luxembourg with variable sanitary pressures. Using carbamazepine as a recalcitrant wastewater indicator, the correlation of the compounds to the latter revealed source and fate variability as well as specific emitters. Relating carbamazepine to sanitary pressure, expressed as the sum of population equivalents in a catchment divided by its surface [PE ha(-1)] allowed predicting the impact of emerging pollutants on the entire river network. The limited variability of the pollutant profiles allowed for prioritization of impacted stretches depending on the different sanitary pressures at risk quotient exceedance. The main drivers of impact were triclosan, diclofenac, clarithromycine and diuron. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigates the removal and fate of 23 emerging organic micropollutants (EOMs) including a wide range of pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, beta-blockers, analgesics, diuretics, psychostimulants, antiepileptics, immunosuppressives, anticoagulants), and steroid hormones detected in municipal wastewater by a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) plant at two different solid retention times (SRTs) of 60 and 21 days. Different removal efficiencies of the selected EOMs were observed and explained based on their physicochemical properties (such as distribution coefficient, log D; dissociation constant, pK(a); solid-water distribution coefficients, and K-d) along with process operating parameters. The dominant removal mechanisms of EOMs were biotransformation and sorption onto the sludge, which were confirmed by the mass balance study. Moreover, changes in the sludge properties, as a consequence of different SRTs, were evaluated based on variations in soluble microbial products (SMP), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and capillary suction time (CST). Finally, the quality of the MBR effluent was compared with some established guidelines, which confirmed the fulfilment of water quality requirements for reuse purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is based on the use of a recently developed cyclodextrin-based polymer that possesses an inherent affinity for the target pharmaceutical. This competitive assay is exploiting the possibility to displace a fluorescent dye, adsorbed in the cyclodextrin-based polymer, by the target drug. This displacement is followed by measuring the increase in fluorescence polarization of the dye released in solution. The assay was successfully tested on a real wastewater sample with a limit of detection of 1 mu M. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen belongs to the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is often used to treat pain of rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases. The photochemical experiments of naproxen degradation were performed in the wastewater effluents from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Kloten/Switzerland at its real concentrations (without standard addition) and in drinking water containing naproxen standard, adjusted to pH = 7 and pH = 6. All performed experiments showed that within 5 min of photochemical oxidation, the disappearance of naproxen exceeded 90%. The first-order rate constants of naproxen degradation were determined. The maximal value of rate constant was observed by UV/H2O2 process in water samples at pH = 6 (k = 0.997 min(-1)).

AB The prevalence and persistence of perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) in environmental and biological systems has been well documented, and a rising number of reports suggest that certain PFCs can result in adverse health effects in mammals. As traditional water sources become increasingly impacted by waste discharge and the demand for planned potable reuse grows, there is recent interest in determining PFC occurrence in drinking water supplies. Here we report monitoring results from drinking water treatment facility samples collected across the United States, and from associated surface, ground, and wastewater sources. Using automated solid phase extraction (SPE) and isotope-dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), samples were screened for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA). Method reporting limits (MRLs) were established at 1.0 ng/L for all monitored PFCs except PFOA, for which the MRL was set at 5.0 ng/L given elevated procedural and instrumental background levels. PFOS was the only investigated PFC detected in minimally impacted surface waters, with individual site averages of 2.0 ng/L and lower. Conversely, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and other highly impacted waters had almost 100% detection frequency for all PFCs except PFUdA and PFDoA, which were not detected above MRL in any samples. Of the investigated PFCs, PFOA averaged the highest overall concentration at any site at 115 ng/L Substantial impacts from treated wastewater generally caused increased summed PFC concentrations at downstream drinking water facilities, although levels and distribution suggest geographical variability. No discernible differences between influent and effluent PFC levels were observed for drinking water facilities. Removal of PFCs, however, was observed at an indirect potable reuse facility using microfiltration and reverse osmosis for wastewater treatment in which case all PFC levels in effluents were below the MRL.

The removals of eleven pharmaceutical compounds in MBR operated at different mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) level were investigated during which nitrification degree was differed. The results experiments revealed the importance of immediate adsorption onto the colloidal particles in supernatant of MBR sludge and subsequently removed by membrane filtration for the recalcitrant pharmaceutical compounds. Nevertheless, the removals through biodegradation during short HRT were also found significant for some compounds.

AB Sewage sludge handling is becoming a concern in Europe due to its increasing amount and the presence of contaminants, such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). Currently, over 70% of sludge in Europe is treated thermally by incineration or used as fertilizer in agriculture. New thermochemical methods are under development and are expected to be implemented in the near future. This paper considers the life cycle environmental impacts of the following five alternatives for sludge handling, taking into account the presence of heavy metals and PPCPs: i) agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge; ii) agricultural application of composted sludge; iii) incineration; iv) pyrolysis; and v) wet air oxidation. The results suggest that anaerobic digestion with recovery of nutrients and electricity has the lowest environmental impacts in 11 out of 18 categories considered. For the mean to maximum resource recovery, composting is the worst alternative, followed by pyrolysis with lower recovery rates. Agricultural application of anaerobically digested sludge has the highest freshwater ecotoxicity due to heavy metals, unless their concentration is in the lowest range, as found in some European sewage sludge applied on land. Therefore, stricter control of heavy metals in the sludge is needed for this option to limit freshwater ecotoxicity to the levels comparable with the thermal processes. The results also indicate that PPCPs have a negligible contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity when compared to heavy metals in the anaerobically digested sludge. Since thermal processes are currently drawing attention due to their potential benefits, the findings of this work suggest that their adoption is environmentally beneficial only if high resource recovery rates can be achieved.

AB The presence of common industrial organic compounds and emerging micropollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in industrial and municipal wastewaters, respectively, has been recognized as a serious environmental problem owing to the recalcitrance and persistence of these compounds in the aquatic environment. In the past two decades, carbon nanotubes and their composites have been gradually applied for the removal of undesirable organic contaminants from water via adsorption. This chapter describes the removal of established toxic chemicals from oil and gas produced water and emerging micropollutants from treated municipal wastewater through the application of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and their composites with titanium dioxide.

AB In this study we evaluated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of native samples of wastewaters (15 samples), surface waters (28 samples) and potable waters (8 samples) with the SOS/umuC assay with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 and MTT assay with human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The genotoxicity of selected samples was confirmed with the comet assay with HepG2 cells. In the SOS/umuC assay 13 out of the 51 samples were genotoxic: two effluent samples from chemical industry; one sample of wastewater treatment plant effluent: two hospital wastewater samples; three river water samples and four lake water samples. Six samples were cytotoxic for HepG2 cells: both effluent samples of chemical industry, two wastewater treatment plant effluent samples, and two river water samples, however, only the chemical industry effluent samples were genotoxic and cytotoxic, indicating that different contaminants are responsible for genotoxic and toxic effects. Comparing genotoxicity of river and lake water samples with the chemical analytical data of the presence of the residues of pharmaceutical and personal care products (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, UV filters and disinfectants) in these samples, indicated that the presence of UV filters might be linked to the genotoxicity of these samples. The results showed that the application of the bacterial SOS/umuC assay and mammalian cell assays (MTT and comet assay) with HepG2 cells was suitably sensitive combination of assays to monitor genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of native samples of wastewaters and surface waters. With this study we also confirmed that the toxicity/genotoxicity bioassays should be an integral tool in the evaluation of toxicity of complex wastewaters before the release into environment, as well as for the monitoring of surface water quality, providing data useful in risk assessment.

AB The performance of an up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing macrolide antibiotics was investigated. Specifically, it was determined whether a UASR could be used as pre-treatment system at an existing pharmaceutical production plant to reduce the antibiotics in the trade effluent. Accordingly, a UASR was developed with an active reactor volume of 11 L being divided into four 2.75 L stages. Each stage of the reactor was an up-flow sludge blanket reactor and had a 3-phase separator baffle to retain biomass. The reactor was fed with real pharmaceutical wastewater containing Tylosin and Avilamycin antibiotics and operated with step-wise increases in the reactor organic loading rate (OLR) from 0.43 to 3.73 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) d(-1), and then reduced to 1.86, over 279 days. The process performance of the reactor was characterised in terms of its COD removal, Tylosin reduction, pH, VIA production, methane yield and sludge washout. At a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 d and OLR of 1.86 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), COD reduction was 70-75%, suggesting the biomass had acclimated to the antibiotics. Furthermore, an average of 95% Tylosin reduction was achieved in the UASR, indicating that this antibiotic could be degraded efficiently in the anaerobic reactor system. in addition, the influence of elevated Tylosin concentrations on the UASR process performance was studied using additions of Tylosin phosphate concentrate. Results showed similar efficiency for COD removal when Tylosin was present at concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 mg L-1 (mean removal over this range was 93%), however, at Tylosin concentrations of 600 and 800mgL(-1) there was a slight decline in treatment efficiency at 85% and 75% removal, respectively.

AB Rudimentary on-site sanitation systems (OSSs) are extensively used in low-income countries despite the risk of groundwater contamination. The present study investigated the potential impact of community soak pits on sandy shallow aquifers in a rural area in Sri Lanka. Thirty-two groundwater samples were collected and measured for the traditional indicators fecal bacteria Escherichia coli, total coliforms, nitrate, and chloride; 7 pharmaceuticals were added as wastewater indicators. Analysis showed that the local groundwater is infected by fecal bacteria, but it was unable to determine whether the source of fecal bacteria is the OSSs. Similarly, nitrate and chloride provided unclear evidence. Conversely, detection of 3 pharmaceuticals at trace levels in groundwater evidenced wastewater impact from OSSs. Caffeine was detected in 89% of the sample at a maximum concentration 7.9 ng/L, indicating fecal pollution. Carbamazepine was detected in 42% of the samples with a concentration of up to 6.9 ng/L, whereas sulfamethoxazole was detected in only 2 samples. The presence of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole was also consistent with recorded drug use of the residents. Escherichia coli showed a moderate positive correlation with caffeine concentration (Kendall's tau = 0.38, p = 0.017), indicating concurring short-lifetime fecal bacteria and labile wastewater organic compounds. Nitrate showed a significant correlation with carbamazepine concentration (tau = 0.39, p = 0.016). Fecal bacteria and nitrate can be used in screening for micropollutants in domestic wells impacted by OSSs. The present case study emphasizes the potential impact of poor sanitation on groundwater resources and the necessity of sanitation improvement in achieving Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries.

AB This study investigated the occurrence and fate of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its related substances, 4-epi-oxytetracycline (EOTC), alpha-apo-oxytetracycline (alpha-apo-OTC), and beta-apo-oxytetracycline (beta-apo-OTC), in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) treating OTC production wastewater and a river receiving the effluent from the WWTP using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The percent removal of OTC in the WWTP was 38.0 +/- 10.5%, and the concentration of OTC was still up to 19.5 +/- 2.9 mg/L in the treated outflow. The concentration slightly decreased along the river, from 641 +/- 118 mu g/L at site R2 (discharging point) to 377 +/- 142 mu g/L at site R4 (similar to 20 km from site R2), which was still higher than the minimal inhibition concentration of OTC reported (similar to 250 mu g/L). On the other hand, the total amount of its related substances in the treated effluent was less than 5% of OTC. Concentrations of alpha-apo-OTC and beta-apo-OTC increased along the river, from 5.76 +/- 0.63 and 2.08 +/- 0.30 mu g/L at site R2 to 11.9 +/- 4.9 and 12.0 +/- 4.6 mu g/L at R4, respectively, although EOTC decreased from 31.5 +/- 3.8 to 12.9 +/- 1.1 mu g/L, respectively. The mean concentration of beta-apo-CTC in river sediments was 20.8 +/- 7.8 mg/kg, and its ratio to OTC was approximately 0.11, nearly twice the ratio of alpha-apo-OTC and EOTC to OTC (0.058 +/- 0.014 and 0.061 +/- 0.015, respectively).

AB A dynamic kinetic model is presented for the UVC/H2O2-driven process. The model comprises 103 reactions, including background species, such as HCO3-/CO32-, NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, and H2PO4-/HPO42/PO43- anions, and effluent organic matter (EfOM) was validated based on experimental data obtained for the photooxidation of the nonribosomal peptide antibiotic zinc bacitracin (Zn-Bc, 34 mu mol L-1). The set of ordinary differential equations for 38 species was combined with the molar balances describing the recirculating tubular photoreactor used. Predictions for the photolytic and UVC/H2O2 processes confirmed the good agreement with experimental data, enabling the estimation of fundamental kinetic parameters, such as the direct photolysis quantum yield (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF254 nm, Zn-Bc = 0.0143 mol Einstein(-1)) and the second-order rate constants for the reactions of Zn-Bc with HO center dot, HO2 center dot, and O-2(center dot-) radicals (2.64 x 10(9), 1.63 x 10(3), and 1.49 x 10(4) L mol(-1) s(-1), respectively). The predicted optimum process conditions correspond to [H2O2](0) = 6.8 mmol L-1 and a specific photon emission rate of 11.1 x 10(-6) Einstein L-1 s(-1). Zn-Bc photooxidation was significantly impacted by wastewater constituents, particularly EfOM and HCO3-/CO32- (i.e., alkalinity), resulting in a degradation rate about 32% lower compared to that obtained in deionized water. In particular, EfOM acts as a strong radical scavenger and inner filter. In addition, simulations pointed out the continuous tubular photochemical reactor as the best configuration for treating Zn-Bc-containing wastewater. This study hence provides a comprehensive modeling approach, especially useful for predicting the effect of complex water matrices on the performance of the UVC/H2O2 treatment process.

AB The ubiquitous presence of trace pharmaceutical compounds in the environment is a significant concern. While the implications of these compounds on ecosystems and human health are being determined, there has been increasing interest in their treatment such as by tertiary processes at sources and wastewater treatment facilities to arrest further release to the environment. We have examined the degradation of sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics in a spiked water and a pharmaceutical wastewater by ozonation under varied conditions such as concentration, contact time, pH, and H2O2/O-3 mole ratio. The results show faster removal kinetics for sulfonamides containing the aromatic ring than for macrolides built of mostly saturated hydrocarbon structure, and that complete removal of all is achieved within 20 min of ozonation at the application rate of 0.17 g O-3/min. Degradation of contaminants containing unsaturated C-C bonds occurs faster at low pH, consistent with O-3 being the predominant oxidant and its aqueous concentration being higher at low pH. Degradation of erythromycin having a fully saturated structure is slower and more effective at higher pH or with added H2O2, both consistent with the enhanced production of OH radical under such conditions that contributes to removal of the saturated compound. Low pH favors degradation via molecular O-3 while high pH via OH radical; the optimal pH thus depends on target compounds being treated, and buffered pH at 7 facilitates removal of all tested compounds. The addition of H2O2 to ozonation abets contaminant removal, and at mole ratio of H2O2/O-3 = 5 it attains the highest degradation speed for all contaminants. However, a large excess of added H2O2 results in reduced or no benefits relative to O-3 alone. Thus, only a small dose of H2O2 is desirable when widely disparate compounds are treated by ozonation.

AB The first step of an anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) system is typically the formation of nitrite (NO2-) via partial nitritation, which can generate hydroxyl radical (OH) when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light. This study demonstrated that the presence of nitrite in buffer and wastewater matrices during medium-pressure UV irradiation (at lambda >= 220 or >= 280 nm) enhanced the degradation of select pharmaceutical compounds of different therapeutic classes (atenolol, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and trimethoprim). Total pharmaceutical removals in a wastewater matrix irradiated at lambda >= 280 for 120 minutes were 47% for trimethoprim, 50% for carbamazepine, 60% for atenolol, and 57% for fluoxetine at fluences of 58.6 mEi m(-2) (2033.1 mJ cm(-2)). When irradiated at lambda >= 220 for 60 minutes, removals were 52% for trimethoprim, 56% for carbamazepine, 69% for atenolol, and 90% for fluoxetine at fluences of 634.7 mEi m(-2) (23 969.2 mJ cm(-2)). Reaction with OH accounted for similar to 78-90% of pharmaceutical removal at lambda >= 280 nm. Although direct photolysis did contribute to target compound removal for irradiation with lambda >= 220 nm, much of the light was absorbed in the buffer and wastewater matrices, and reaction with OH accounted for similar to 70-93% of pharmaceutical removal. Quencher experiments with isopropanol confirmed the importance of reaction with OH as the main contributor to pharmaceutical removal. para-Chlorobenzoic acid was used as a probe to estimate steady-state OH concentrations, which averaged 8.58 x 10(-15) M for both matrices at lambda >= 280 nm and 3.50 x 10(-14) M for both matrices at lambda >= 220 nm. Nitrosamines were formed and accumulated during the UV treatment step, however, concomitant with their direct photochemical destruction. Presence of the pharmaceutical micro-pollutants studied, such as the secondary-amine containing atenolol and fluoxetine, did not elevate nitrosamine formation.

AB A method combining ultrasound-assisted emulsification-microextraction (USAEME) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for simultaneous determination of four acidic pharmaceuticals, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac, as well as four phenols, 4-octylphenol, 4-n-nonylphenol, bisphenol A, and triclosan in municipal wastewaters. Conditions of extraction and simultaneous derivatization were optimized with respect to such aspects as type and volume of extraction solvent, volume of derivatization reagent, kind and amount of buffering salt, location of the test tube in the ultrasonic bath, and extraction time. The average correlation coefficient of the calibration curves was 0.9946. The LOD/(LOQ) values in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 0.002-0.121/(0.005-0.403) mu g L-1 and 0.002-0.828/(0.006-2.758) mu g L-1, respectively. Quantitative recoveries (a parts per thousand yen94 %) and satisfactory precision (average RSD 8.2 %) were obtained. The optimized USAEME/GC-MS method was applied for determination of the considered pharmaceuticals and phenols in influents and treated effluents from nine Polish municipal wastewater treatment plants. The average concentration of acidic pharmaceuticals in influent and effluent wastewater were in the range of 0.06-551.96 mu g L-1 and 0.01-22.61 mu g L-1, respectively, while for phenols were in the range of 0.03-102.54 mu g L-1 and 0.02-10.84 mu g L-1, respectively. The removal efficiencies of the target compounds during purification process were between 84 and 99 %.

AB The overuse of antibiotics in livestock farms is general, leading to a wide distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environment adjacent to livestock farms. However, researches of the distribution and types of ARGs in aquatic environment of China are still in the initial stage. In this study, wastewater and surface water samples were collected from 12 livestock farms (four pig farms, four cattle farms, and four chicken farms) in Jiangsu Province of China. The prevalence, abundance, and distribution of 22 ARGs were investigated, which were categorized into six groups, including nine tetracyclin resistance genes, three sulfonamides resistance genes, three quinolone resistance genes, two macrolide resistance genes, three aminoglycoside resistance genes, and two multidrug resistance genes, employing quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results suggested that all of the 22 ARGs were detected in samples. Sul1, sul2, and tetM were the most abundant with the average concentration of 3.84 x 10(1) copies/16S recombinant RNA (rRNA) gene copies, 1.62 x 10(1) copies/16S rRNA gene copies, 2.33 x 10(1) copies/16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Principle component analysis revealed that the comprehensive pollution of ARGs in northern Jiangsu was more serious. ARGs in wastewater were more abundant when compared to that in surface water. A preliminary study regarding the fate of ARGs after an aerobiotic process showed that tetA, tetC, sul1, sul2, oqxB, and qnrS were significantly increased. And, among the tetracycline resistance genes, the efflux pump genes were enriched while the ribosomal protection protein encoding genes were decreased in the aerobiotic process. The prevalance of ARGs in water environment is of concern; more surveillance is required to determine the pollution level and pattern of antibiotic resistance genes.

AB The decomposition of ozone in wastewater is observed starting 350 milliseconds after ozone addition. It seems not to be controlled by the autocatalytic chain reaction, hut rather by direct reactions with reactive moieties of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). A larger ozone dose increases ozone consumption prior to 350 milliseconds but decreases the rate of ozone decomposition later on; this effect is predicted by a second-order kinetic model. Transferred ozone Dose (TOD) is poorly correlated with ozone exposure (= integral[O-3]dt) indicating that TOD is not a suitable parameter for the prediction of disinfection or oxidation in wastewater. HO circle concentrations (> 10(-10) M) and R-ct (=integral[HO circle]dt vertical bar integral[O-3]dt > 10(-6)) are larger than in most advanced oxidation processes (AOP) in natural waters, but rapidly decrease over time. R-ct also decreases with increasing pre-ozonation doses. An increase in pH accelerates ozone decomposition and HO circle generation; this effect is predicted by a kinetic model taking into account deprotonation of reactive moieties of the DOM. DOC emerges as a crucial water quality parameter that might be of use to normalize ozone doses when comparing ozonation in different wastewaters. A rapid drop of absorbance in the water matrix-with a maximum between 255-285 nm- is noticeable in the first 350 milliseconds and is directly proportional to ozone consumption. The rate of absorbance decrease at 285 nm is first order with respect to ozone concentration. A kinetic model is introduced to explore ozone decomposition induced by distributions of reactive moieties at sub-stoichiometric ozone concentrations. The model helps visualize and comprehend the operationally defined "instantaneous ozone demand" observed during ozone batch experiments with DOM-containing waters.

AB A significant number of emerging pollutants resulting from point source and diffuse pollution are present in the aquatic environment. These are chemicals that are not commonly monitored, but have the potential to cause adverse effects on human and ecological health. One form of emerging pollutants, pharmaceu-tical and personal care products (PPCPs), are becoming a serious problem in the discharge of domestic wastewater. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine their occurrence in wastewater and surface waters, and to evaluate the efficiency of subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands (planted in polyculture and unplanted), in removing two pharmaceuticals: carbamazepine (Cbz) and sildenafil (Sil); and a personal care product: methylparaben (Mp), present in domestic wastewater. The mixed PPCPs were added to wetlands, at nominal concentrations of 200 mu g / L for each compound. The working flow of the reactors was 15 mL / min and the hydraulic retention time was three days. The physicochemical parameters evaluated were: organic load, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, redox potential, dissolved solids, pH and PPCPs concentration. The presence of the three compounds became evident in all sampled sites, with concentrations of up to 10.66 mu g / L, 7.24 mu g / L and 2.64 mu g / L for Cbz, Mp and Sil, respectively. In planted wetlands, removal efficiencies of up to 97% were achieved for Sil, while in the unplanted these were 30% lower. Removal efficiencies greater than 97% were achieved for Mp, however, for Cbz they were less than 10%, evaluated in both treatments. The average removal efficiency for organic load was 95%. It was determined that constructed wetlands can efficiently remove simple molecular structure compounds such as Mp, and complex structures such as Sil. However, Cbz remained as a recalcitrant contaminant. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and other chemicals lacking water quality standards are frequently found in surface water. While evidence is growing that these contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) - those previously unknown, unrecognized, or unregulated - can affect the behavior and reproduction of fish and wildlife, little is known about the distribution of these chemicals in rural, tribal areas. Therefore, we surveyed the presence of CECs in water, sediment, and subsistence fish species across various waterbodies, categorized as undeveloped (i.e., no human development along shorelines), developed (i.e., human development along shorelines), and wastewater effluent-impacted (i.e., contain effluence from wastewater treatment plants), within the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and 1854 Ceded Territory in northeastern Minnesota, U.S.A. Overall, in 28 sites across three years (2016-2018), 117 of the 158 compounds tested were detected in at least one form of medium (i.e., water, sediment, or fish). CECs were detected most frequently at wastewater effluent-impacted sites, with up to 83 chemicals detected in one such lake, while as many as 17 were detected in an undeveloped lake. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the number of CECs present in developed versus undeveloped lakes, a range of 3-17 CECs were detected across these locations. Twenty-two CECs were detected in developed and undeveloped sites that were not detected in wastewater effluent-impacted sites. The detection of CECs in remote, undeveloped locations, where subsistence fish are harvested, raises scientific questions about the safety and security of subsistence foods for indigenous communities. Further investigation is warranted so that science-based solutions to reduce chemical risks to aquatic life and people can be developed locally and be informative for indigenous communities elsewhere.

AB Contamination with fluoroaromatics (FAs), particularly polyfluorinated aniline, is becoming a serious environmental problem worldwide. To shorten the start-up time, and increase the stability of treatment systems, this work focused on the effects of three seeding sources on treatment performances of 2,3,4-trifluoroaniline (2,3,4-TFA) during start-up and shock, as well as the acclimated strategy. After 246-323 days of acclimation in a stepwise feeding according to the inhibition degree, three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) successfully achieved efficient removal, i.e., 300.00 mg/L of 2,3,4-TFA, with over 95.00% of degradation efficiency and 60.00-80.00% of defluorination rates. The sludge obtained from the fluorizated hydrocarbon wastewater treatment plant(FHS) without prior exposure to fluoroaniline was determined to be optimal, based on the observed shortest start-up time of 246 days, the highest defluorination rate of 70.00-80.00%, the fastest recovery time of 7 days after shock, and the highest microbial diversity with nine dominant bacterial groups. Furthermore, compared with the sludge obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater containing part of municipal wastewater treatment plant(PMS), the seeding source used in treating the comprehensive wastewater in industrial park (CIS) exhibited earlier defluorination reaction, higher defluorination rate and microbial diversity, but lower shock resistance. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that microbial diversity was dependent on the origin of the inoculum after acclimation. We identified two predominant phyla in PMS, namely, Deinococcus-Thermus (24.43%) and Bacteroidetes (18.44%), whereas these were Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi in FHS and CIS. During the shock of 400 mg/L 2,3,4-TFA, the predominant bacteria norank_f_Blastocatellaceae and norank_f_Methylobacteriaceae disappeared, and the defluorination reaction hardly occurred, indicating that the bacterial genera could contribute to the defluorination reaction.

AB The application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the treatment of wastewater is hindered by scavenging of the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) by effluent organic matter (EfOM). This scavenging is directly proportional to the second-order reaction rate constant between EfOM and HO center dot (k(EfOM-HO center dot)). To understand the kinetics of this reaction as a function of the subcomponents of EfOM, four wastewater samples were fractionated by ultrafiltration into distinct apparent molecular weight (AMW) fractions (<1, <3, <5, and <10 kDa), and their k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were quantified. In general, the values for k(EfOM-HO center dot) decreased as the AMW increased. The values of k(EfOM-HO center dot) for the bulk waters varied between 6.32 and 14.1 x 10(8) M(C)(-1)s(-1) (units of per molar carbon concentration per second). In the case of the 1 kDa fraction, the values of k(EfOM-HO center dot). varied from 14.3 to 35.0 x 10(8) M(C)(-1)s(-1), or approximately 2.31(+/- 0.24) times that of the corresponding bulk waters. For the <3 kDa, <5 kDa, and <10 kDa fractions, the k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were 1.83(+/- 0.25), 1.32(+/- 0.23), and 1.26(+/- 0.35) times that of the bulk waters, respectively. Based on the obtained results, the variability and general magnitude of the k(EfOM-HO center dot) values were attributed to the production and reactivity of soluble microbial products (SMP), a major component of EfOM. Two samples collected at a wastewater treatment facility with different treatment variables had different k(EfOM-HO center dot) values, indicating that wastewater treatment processes will impact overall HO center dot scavenging by EfOM and should be considered during the implementation of AOPs.

AB A two years drip irrigation of lettuce and leek crops with treated municipal wastewater without and with spiking with fourteen wastewater relevant contaminants at 10 mu g/L concentration level was conducted under greenhouse cultivation conditions to investigate their potential accumulation in soil and leaves and to assess human health related risks. Lettuce and leek crops were selected as a worse-case scenario since leafy green vegetable has a high potential for organic contaminants uptake. The results revealed limited accumulation of contaminants in soil and plant leaves, their concentration levels being in the range of 1-30 ng/g and 1-660 ng/g range in soil and leaves, respectively. This was likely related to abiotic and biotic transformation or simply binding processes in soil, which limited contaminants plant uptake. This assumption was underpinned by studies of the enantiomeric fractionation of chiral compounds (e.g. climbazole and metoprolol) in soil as pieces of evidence of biodegradation and by the identification of transformation products or metabolites in leaves by means of liquid chromatography - high resolution - mass spectrometry using a suspect screening workflow. The high bioconcentration factors were not limited to compounds with intermediate D-ow (100 to 1000) such as carbamazepine but also observed for hydrophilic compounds such as clarithromycin, hydrochlorothiazide and the food additives acesulfame and sucralose. This result assumed that accumulation was not only driven by passive processes (e.g. lipoidal diffusion through lipid bilayer cell membranes or Casparian strip) but might be supported by carrier-mediated transporters. As a whole, this study confirmed earlier reports on the a de minimis human health risk related to the consumption of raw leafy green vegetable irrigated with domestic TWW containing organic contaminants residues.

AB Operation at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (<1 mg/L) in wastewater treatment could save utilities significantly by reducing aeration energy costs. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of low DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during treatment. DO concentration can impact pharmaceutical biotransformation rates during wastewater treatment both directly and indirectly: directly by acting as a limiting substrate that slows the activity of the microorganisms involved in biotransformation; and indirectly by shaping the microbial community and selecting for a community that performs pharmaceutical biotransformation faster (or slower). In this study, nitrifying bioreactors were operated at low (similar to 0.3 mg/L) and high (>4 mg/L) DO concentrations to understand how DO growth conditions impacted microbial community structure. Short-term batch experiments using the biomass from the parent reactors were performed under low and high DO conditions to understand how DO concentration impacts microbial physiology. Although the low DO parent biomass had a lower specific activity with respect to ammonia oxidation than the high DO parent reactor biomass, it had faster biotransformation rates of ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, acetaminophen, and atenolol in high DO batch conditions. This was likely because the low DO reactor had a 2x higher biomass concentration, was enriched for ammonia oxidizers (4x higher concentration), and harbored a more diverse microbial community (3x more unique taxa) as compared to the high DO parent reactor. Overall, the results show that there can be indirect benefits from low DO operation over high DO operation that support pharmaceutical biotransformation during wastewater treatment.

AB The arrival and discharge of seven antibiotics were monitored at two trickling filter sewage treatment plants of 6000 and 11,000 population equivalents (PE) and two activated sludge plants of 33,000 and 162,000 PE in Southern England. The investigation consisted of 24 h composite samples taken on two separate days every summer from 2012 to 2015 and in the winter of 2015 (January) from influent and effluent. The average influent concentrations generally matched predictions based on England-wide prescription data for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, oxytetracycline and levofloxacin (within 3-fold), but were 3-10 times less for clarithromycin, whilst tetracycline influent concentrations were 5-17 times greater than expected. Over the four years, effluent concentrations at a single sewage plant varied by up to 16-fold for clarithromycin, 10-fold for levofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, 7-fold for oxytetracycline, 6-fold for tetracycline, 4-fold for azithromycin and 3-fold for trimethoprim. The study attempted to identify the principal reasons for this variation in effluent concentration. By measuring carbamazepine and using it as a conservative indicator of transport through the treatment process, it was found that flow and hence concentration could alter by up to 5-fold. Measuring influent and effluent concentrations allowed assessments to be made of removal efficiency. In the two activated sludge plants, antibiotic removal rates were similar for the tested antibiotics but could vary by several-fold at the trickling filter plants. However, for clarithromycin and levofloxacin the variations in effluent concentration were above that which could be explained by either flow and/or removal alone so here year on year changes in consumption are likely to have played a role.

AB Pharmaceuticals designed for humans and animals often remain unused for a variety of reasons, ranging from expiration to a patient's non-compliance. These leftover, accumulated drugs represent sub-optimal delivery of health care and the potential for environmentally unsound disposal, which can pose exposure risks for humans and wildlife. A major unknown with respect to drugs as pollutants is what fractions of drug residues occurring in the ambient environment result from discarding leftover drugs. To gauge the significance of leftover drugs as potential pollutants, data are needed on the types, quantities, and frequencies with which drugs accumulate. Absence of this data has prevented assessments of the significance of drug accumulation and disposal as a contributing source of drug residues in the environment. One particular source of drug accumulation is those drugs that become "orphaned" by the death of a consumer. A new approach to acquiring the data needed to assess the magnitude and extent of drug disposal as a source of environmental pollution is presented by using the inventories of drugs maintained by coroner offices. The data from one metropolitan coroner's office demonstrates proof of concept. Coroner data on leftover drugs are useful for measuring the types and amounts of drugs accumulated by consumers. This inventory also provides an accurate measure of the individual active ingredients actually disposed into sewage by coroners. The types of questions these data can address are presented, and the possible uses of these data for deriving estimates of source contributions from the population at large are discussed. The approach is proposed for nationwide implementation (and automation) to better understand the significance of consumer disposal of medications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation of crops is growing in arid and semi-arid regions, whilst increasing amounts of biosolids are being applied to fields to improve agricultural outputs. Due to incomplete removal in the wastewater treatment processes, pharmaceuticals present in treated wastewater and biosolids can contaminate soil systems. Benzodiazepines are a widely used class of pharmaceuticals that are released following wastewater treatment. Benzodiazepines are represented by a class of compounds with a range of physicochemical properties and this study was therefore designed to evaluate the influence of soil properties on the sorption behaviour and subsequent uptake of seven benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam. flurazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam) in two plant species. The sorption and desorption behaviour of benzodiazepines was strongly influenced by soil type and hydrophobicity of the chemical. The partitioning behaviour of these chemicals in soil was a key controller of the uptake and accumulation of benzodiazepines by radish (Raphanus sativus) and silverbeet (Beta vulgaris). Benzodiazepines such as oxazepam that were neutral, had low sorption coefficients (K-d) or had pH-adjusted log octanol-water partition coefficients (log D-ow, pH 6.3) values close to 2 had the greatest extent of uptake. Conversely, benzodiazepines such as flurazepam that had an ionised functional groups and greater K-d values had comparatively limited accumulation in the selected plant species. Results also revealed active in-plant metabolism of benzodiazepines, potentially analogous to the known metabolic transformation pathway of benzodiazepines in humans. Along with this observed biological transformation of benzodiazepines in exposed plants, previously work has established the widespread presence of the plant signalling molecule-y-amino butyric acid (GABA), which is specifically modulated by benzodiazepines in humans. This highlights the need for further assessment of the potential for biological activity of benzodiazepines following their plant uptake. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Drugs of addiction, have been recognized as potential contaminants of concern to the environment. Effluent wastewater discharge is a major source of contamination to aquatic receiving environments. A year-long monitoring program was undertaken in Australia to characterise the fate of four emerging drugs of addiction: methamphetamine; MDMA; pharmaceutical opioids: codeine and morphine and a metabolite: benzoylecgonine in four wastewater treatment plants operating with different secondary treatment technologies: conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactors (MBR), integrated fixed-film AS (IFAS) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The effect of subsequent tertiary treatment (coagulation/flocculation) on the removal efficiency was also assessed.
   Drugs were detected in influent and effluent samples (mean concentration ranged from 43-4777 and 17-1721 ng/L, respectively). Treated effluents had noticeably lower levels compared to raw influents. Removal efficiency of compounds depended on the secondary treatment employed, with IFAS and MBR performing the best with significant removal of compounds (approximate to 90%) followed by CAS (54-96%) and lastly SBR (42-83%). Despite the low levels of drugs measured after the secondary treatment, near complete removal after tertiary treatment (approximate to 99%) was recorded, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using the coagulation/flocculation process as an effective step for enhancing the removal efficiency. The levels of drugs were at a low level in the effluents released into the environment and used for recycling and all posed a low environmental risk in urban water courses based on the risk assessment. The information given here provides new and useful information to the water industry and regulators on the efficiency of drug removal in a range of wastewater treatment configurations.

AB The treatment of wastewaters is crucial to maintain the ecological status of receiving waters, and thereby guarantee the protection of aquatic life and human health. Wastewater quality evaluation is conventionally based on physicochemical parameters, but increasing attention has been paid to integrate physicochemical and biological data. Nevertheless, the regulatory use of fish in biological testing methods has been subject to various ethical and cost concerns, and in vitro cell-based assays have thus become an important topic of interest. Hence, the present study intends: (a) to evaluate the efficiency of two different sample pre-concentration techniques (lyophilisation and solid phase extraction) to assess the toxicity of municipal effluents on rat cardiomyoblast H9c2(2-1) cells, and (b) maximizing the use of the effluent sample collected, to estimate the environmental condition of the receiving environment. The gathered results demonstrate that the H9c2(2-1) sulforhodamine B-based assay is an appropriate in vitro method to assess biological effluent toxicity, and the best results were attained by lyophilising the sample as pre-treatment. Due to its response, the H9c2(2-1) cell line might be a possible alternative in vitro model for fish lethal testing to assess the toxicity of municipal effluents. The physicochemical status of the sample suggests a high potential for eutrophication, and iron exceeded the permissible level for wastewater discharge, possibly due to the addition of ferric chloride for wastewater treatment. In general, the levels of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole are higher than those reported for other countries, and both surpassed the aquatic protective values for long-term exposure.

AB In this research, treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PhW) obtained from a factory by electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes was investigated. The effects of several parameters involving pH, current density, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW, UVA light, and time were studied. The experiments were designed by Design Expert software, and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum conditions for the highest COD removal. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), time was the most significant parameter on the process response (COD removal) followed by current density. The optimal conditions for 86.85% of COD removal through the EF process were at pH of 2.96, current density of 42.90 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 3.78, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.37 ml/L, and reaction time of 58.49 min, while the optimal conditions for 93.00% of COD removal through PEF process were at pH of 2.91, current density of 43.71 mA/cm(2), H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio of 4.29, volume ratio of H2O2/PhW of 1.67 ml/L, UVA light of 6 W, and reaction time of 54.24 min. It was concluded that UVA light can increase the COD removal through PEF process around 7% more than that of the EF process at optimum conditions. Practitioner points
   Treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater by EF and PEF processes was investigated. Effects of several parameters were entirely studied on both the processes. RSM was applied to determine optimum conditions for the highest COD removal for both the processes. UVA light increased COD removal through PEF process (around 7%) at the optimum conditions.

AB The effect of solar radiation on the inactivation of multidrug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR) strains selected from an urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) effluent and the change of their resistance to a mixture of three antibiotics (evaluated in terms of minimum inhibit concentration (MIC)) in wastewater polluted stream were investigated. The solar photodegradation of the mixture of the three target antibiotics (amoxicillin (AMX), ciprofloxacin (CPX), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)) was also evaluated. Additionally, since UWWTP effluents are possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria, the disinfection by conventional chlorination process of the UWWTP effluent inoculated with MDR strains was investigated too. Solar radiation poorly affected the inactivation of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (40 and 60% after 180 min irradiation). Moreover, solar radiation did not affect strain resistance to AMX (MIC > 256 mu g/mL) and SMZ (MIC > 1024 mu g/mL), but affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to CPX (MIC decreased by 33% but only after 180 min of irradiation). Chlorination of wastewater sample strongly decreased the number of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (99.667 and 99.999%), after 60 min of contact time at 2.0 mg/L initial chlorine concentration, but the resistance of survived colonies to antibiotics was unchanged. Finally, the solar photodegradation rate of the antibiotic mixture (1 mg/L initial concentration respectively) resulted in the following order (half-life time): CPX (t(1/2) = 24 min)< AMX (t(1/2) = 99 min)< SMZ (t(1/2) = 577 min). Accordingly, the risk of the development of resistance to SMZ in surface water is significantly higher compared to CPX and AMX. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A developing number of contaminants are entering into water supplies from industrialization and human actions. On account of pharmaceuticals, individual care items, hormones, pesticides, and other substance intensifies that are discharged into the water supply, rising contaminations distinguished in water may have contrary effects to human wellbeing and aquatic environments. In perspective of the previously mentioned issues, late consideration has been centered on the improvement of more effective, low cost, vigorous strategies for wastewater treatment, without additionally focusing on nature or endangering human wellbeing by the treatment itself. The treatment methodologies include primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment using chemical and biological processes. Various strategies, for example, electrochemical, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, coagulation, membrane separation, adsorption, dialysis, flotation, and biological methods have been utilized for the expulsion of harmful contaminations from water and wastewater.

AB Electrodialysis (ED) is a promising emerging electrochemical membrane technology for nutrient concentration and recovery from wastewater. However associated environmental safety aspects have to be assessed before utilizing concentrated nutrient produced by ED, for instance as fertilizer. Municipal wastewaters contain various micropollutants that have the potential of being concentrated during the ED treatment processes. This study quantified the transport of pharmaceuticals during ED nutrient recovery from synthetic centrate wastewater. Specifically, it is evaluated whether pharmaceutical micropollutants are mobile, and therefore able to transport across the cation exchange membranes and concentrate into the ED concentrate product. Results demonstrate that NH4+-N, PO43--P and K+ could be concentrated up to 5 times in the concentrated ED product (3700-4000 mg/L NH4+-N, 21-25 mg/L PO43--P, 990-1040 mg/L K+). Target micropollutants, such as diclofenac, carbamazepine and furosemide were largely retained in the diluent, with less than 8% being transported across to the concentrate product (feed micropollutant concentration 10 or 100 mu g/L) based on the final target pharmaceutical amounts in the ED concentrate product (mu g). Some transport of micropollutants such as atenolol, metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide was observed to the concentrate product. For instance a final concentration of 10.3, 9.4 and 8.6 mu g/L on average was measured for these pollutants in the final ED concentrate product (final volume similar to 1 L) in experiments with a feed water (initial volume 20 L) containing only 10 mu g/L of target pharmaceuticals. Transport of pharmaceuticals across the ED membranes was concluded to be dominated mainly by the molecule hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity as well as electrostatic interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and ED membranes. Particularly excluded were those having a negative charge and high hydrophobicity such as diclofenac and ibuprofen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The simultaneous degradation of seventeen emerging concern pollutants in effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) of Bogota-Colombia was studied using high frequency ultrasound (375 kHz). The considered compounds in the effluent corresponded to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, carbamazepine, venlafaxine, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, valsartan, losartan, irbesartan, sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, trimethoprim and clindamycin); cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine. Due to limitation of the MWTP for the pollutants elimination, ultrasound was applied to remove these compounds. Interestingly, ultrasonic physical action led to releasing of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from suspended solids, whereas the chemical effects induced degradation of the rest of compounds. For the latter ones, an interesting correlation between the sonodegradation and arithmetic multiplication between hydrophobicity and concentration of pollutants was established. Afterwards, the sonochemical process was complemented with ferrous ions (sono-Fenton), ferrous ions plus light (sono-photo-Fenton) or ferrous ions plus light in presence of oxalic acid (sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid). Additionally, to clarify fundamental aspects of the different systems, individual treatments in distilled water of a model pollutant (valsartan) were performed. The complemented processes significantly enhanced all compounds degradation, following the order: sotto-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid > sono-photo-Fenton similar to sono-Fenton > sonochemistry. The Fe2+ addition improved the pollutants elimination by generation of more hydroxyl radicals in the solution bulk. Meanwhile, oxalic acid avoided Fe3+ precipitation favoring the iron catalytic cycle. Thus, the work demonstrates the high potentiality of the sono-photo-Fenton/oxalic acid system for the pollutants elimination in real-world wastewater matrices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Antibiotics have been increasingly used for veterinary and medical purposes. The overuse of these compounds for these purposes can pollute the environment, water resources in particular. Tetracycline, among other forms of antibiotics, is one of the most applied antibiotic in aquaculture and veterinary medicine. The present study aimed to tack the traces of tetracycline in the effluents of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants, surface and groundwater resources and finally the drinking water provided from these water resources.
   Methods: The samples were taken from Fasha-Foyeh Dam, wells located at Varamin Plain, and Yaftabad; and also, wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater treatment plant effluents of Emam Khomeini Hospital and a municipal wastewater treatment plant which its effluent is being released to the surface water of the area covered in this work. 24 samples were collected in total during July 2012 to December 2012. The prepared samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: Based on the results, mean tetracycline levels in surface and ground water at nearby of animal farms was found to vary from 5.4 to 8.1 ng L-1. Furthermore, the maximum TC concentration of 9.3 ng L-1 was found to be at Yaft-Abad sampling station. Although tetracycline traces could not be detected in any investigated Hospital WWTP effluents, it was tracked in MWWTP effluent samples, in the concentration range of 280 to 540 ng L-1.
   Conclusion: The results showed that the concentration of TC in water resource near the animal farms is higher than the other sampling stations. This is related to the usage of antibiotic for animals. In fact, it caused the contamination of water resources and could contribute to radical changes in the ecology of these regions.

AB To predict the likely effects of management action on any point source discharge into the coastal ocean, it is essential to understand both the composition of the effluent and the environmental conditions in the receiving waters. We illustrate a broadly-applicable approach to evaluating the comprehensive environmental footprint of a discharge, using regional geochemical budgets and nearfleld monitoring. We take as a case study municipal effluent discharged into the Strait of Georgia (west coast of Canada), where there has been public controversy over the discharge of screened or primary-treated effluent directly into the ocean. Wastewater contributes <= 1% of the nitrogen, organic carbon and oxygen demand in the Strait and is unlikely to cause eutrophication, harmful algal blooms or hypoxia in this region. Metals (Hg, Pb, Cd) are controlled by natural cycles augmented by past mining and urbanization, with 0.3-5% of the flux contributed by wastewater. Wastewater contributes similar to 5% of PCBs but <= 60% of PBDEs and is likely also important for pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Effects of high organic flux on benthos are measurable in the immediate receiving environment The availability of particle-active contaminants to enter the food chain depends on how long those contaminants remain in the sediment surface mixed layer before burial. Secondary treatment, slated for completion in Vancouver in 2030, will reduce fluxes of some contaminants, but will have negligible effect on regional budgets for organic carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, metals and PCBs. Removal of PBDEs from wastewater will affect regional budgets, depending on how the sludge is sequestered. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface waters are used for disposal of treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants. These effluents usually contain only small amounts of various contaminants but these harmful components accumulate overtime in the river, especially in sediments.
   An integrated approach for the evaluation of the impact of treated effluents was used to predict an ecological risk assessment to the Krka river beside Novo Mesto. The effluents from pharmaceutical and municipal wastewater treatment plants were discharged too closely into the receiving stream, so that separate impacts could not be distinguished. Biologically treated industrial effluents contained great amounts of barely biodegradable organic pollution, organic nitrogen, ammonia and phosphorus, and sometimes zinc. The toxicity of effluents was mostly dependent on their chemical composition. The municipal discharge contained greater amounts of organic pollution that was completely biodegraded but still had a great nutrient pollution load. The effluents were nontoxic. The harmful substances from the effluents were traced in the river. In the downstream site slightly higher concentration of organic pollutants, organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and zinc were detected due to discharges. The river water was over-saturated with oxygen, especially in the summer. In toxicity tests, samples of the river water were nontoxic. Sediments at the downstream site accumulated from discharged organic nitrogen, phosphorus, or zinc.
   The results of our study show that the main problem is eutrophication of the river Krka, so it is obvious we must reduce the quantity of nutrients in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants. In both effluents it wilt be necessary to reduce the polluting load of phosphorus, the limiting element for growth of algae and macrophytes in the receiving stream. In the industrial effluent it will be necessary to reduce substances which cause toxicity, such as zinc and nonbiodegradable organic compounds that may be accumulated in the water ecosystem over time.

AB The enantioseparation of (S)-amlodipine and (R)-amlodipine from pharmaceutical wastewater by hollow fiber supported liquid membrane was examined. The pH effects of feed solution, concentration of (+)-DBTA, temperature and the flow rates of feed and stripping solution were investigated. A central composite design (CCD) was used for the design of experiment and to determine the significant factors and their interactions. Regression equations were created from the CCD to predict the percentages of extraction and stripping with varying factor levels. The validity of the model was evaluated, and the optimized condition determined by response surface methodology. The highest extraction and stripping performances were 82.0 and 76.0%, respectively.

AB Antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as emerging environmental contaminants and possess potential crisis to global public health. However, little is known about the differences between various configurations of two-stage combinations of constructed wetlands (CWs) on antibiotics and ARG removal from wastewater. In the study, three configurations of two-stage hybrid CWs (horizontal subsurface flow-down-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-DVF; horizontal subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-UVF; down-flow vertical subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, DVF-UVF) were operated to evaluate their ability to remove high-concentration antibiotics (tilmicosin-TMS and doxycycline-DOC), ARGs (seven tet genes and three erm genes), intI1, 16S rRNA, and nutrients from goose wastewater. The results showed that all three hybrid CWs could remove more than 98% of TMS and DOC from wastewater, without significant difference among treatments (p > 0.05). For ARGs, DVF-UVF showed significantly higher removal efficiencies of intI1, ermB, ermC, ermF, tetW, and tetG compared to HF-UVF (p < 0.05), mainly because they might remove and arrest growth of bacteria. The relatively high removal efficiencies of NH4+-N, NO3-N, and NO2--N were also observed from DVF-UVF, ranging from 87% to 95% (p > 0.05), indicating that anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) might be established in the CWs. Our results demonstrate that the removal performances of antibiotics using two-stage hybrid CWs are not affected by the combined configuration, whereas the combination of DVF and UVF CWs perform better on the removal of ARGs and nutrients compared with HF-DVF and HF-UVF CWs.

AB There has been a substantial research focus on the presence of pesticides in flowers and the subsequent exposure to honeybees. Here we demonstrate for the first time that honeybees can also be exposed to pharmaceuticals, commonly present in wastewater. Residues of carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic drug) up to 371 ng/mL and 30 mu g/g were detected in nectar and pollen sampled from zucchini flowers (Cucurbita pepo) grown in carbamazepine spiked soil (0.5-20 mu g/g). Under realistic exposure conditions from the use of recycled wastewater, carbamazepine concentrations were estimated to be 0.37 ng/L and 30 ng/kg in nectar and pollen, respectively. Incorporation of environmentally relevant carbamazepine residues in nectar and pollen into a modelling framework able to simulate beehive dynamics including the honeybee foraging activity at the landscape scale (BEEHAVE and BEESCOUT) enabled the simulation of carbamazepine translocation from zucchini fields into honeybee hives. Carbamazepine accumulation was modelled in 11 beehives across a 25 km(2) landscape over three years chosen to represent distinct climatic conditions. During a single flowering period, carbamazepine concentrations were simulated to range between 0 and 2478 ng per beehive. The amount of carbamazepine gathered not only varied across the simulated years but there were also differences in accumulation of carbamazepine between beehives within the same year. This work illustrates a fundamental first step in assessing the risk of pharmaceuticals to bees through realistic scenarios by demonstrating a method to quantify potential exposure of honeybees at the landscape scale. Pharmaceuticals are being inadvertently but increasingly applied to agricultural lands globally via the use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation in response to water scarcity problems. We have demonstrated a route of pharmaceutical exposure to honeybees via contaminated nectar and pollen. Given the biological potency of pharmaceuticals, accumulation of these chemicals in nectar and pollen suggest potential implications for honeybee health, with unknown ecosystem consequences.

AB Water samples from Vietnam, The Philippines, and Myanmar were analyzed for artificial sweeteners (ASs) and iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICMs). High concentrations (low micrograms per liter) of ASs, including aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, were found in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents from Vietnam. Three ICMs, iohexol, iopamidol, and iopromide were detected in Vietnamese WWTP influents and effluents, suggesting that these ICMs are frequently used in Vietnam. ASs and ICMs were found in river water from downtown Hanoi at concentrations comparable to or lower than the concentrations in WWTP influents. The ASs and ICMs concentrations in WWTP influents and adjacent surface water significantly correlated (r (2) = 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting that household wastewater is discharged directly into rivers in Vietnam. Acesulfame was frequently detected in northern Vietnamese groundwater, but the concentrations varied spatially by one order of magnitude even though the sampling points were very close together. This implies that poorly performing domestic septic tanks sporadically leak household wastewater into groundwater. High acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose concentrations were found in surface water from Manila, The Philippines. The sucralose concentrations were one order of magnitude higher in the Manila samples than in the Vietnamese samples, indicating that more sucralose is used in The Philippines than in Vietnam. Acesulfame and cyclamate were found in surface water from Pathein (rural) and Yangon (urban) in Myanmar, but no ICMs were found in the samples. The ASs concentrations were two-three orders of magnitude lower in the samples from Myanmar than in the samples from Vietnam and The Philippines, suggesting that different amounts of ASs are used in these countries. We believe this is the first report of persistent ASs and ICMs having ubiquitous distributions in economically emerging South Asian countries.

AB The presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as antibiotics, antimicrobial disinfectants, nonprescription drugs, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and steroids, in water resources can impact aquatic and human health. A large portion of the CECs entering regional wastewater treatment plants originate from hospitals. The purposes of this study were to conduct exploratory analytical work to characterize two hospital wastewaters and to evaluate treatment of CECs at hospitals before dilution with domestic wastewater. A 24-h batch reaction with biogenic manganese oxides coated onto coir fiber was used to treat the wastewaters. Organic contaminants in the wastewaters were concentrated by both liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE). LLE extracts were analyzed by Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) while SPE extracts were analyzedby UltraHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography/Time-ofFlight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-TOFMS). Fifty-two organic micropollutants were detected (26 by GC x GC-TOFMS, 25 by UHPLC-TOFMS, 1 by both) in the wastewaters, while 29 were removed by >90% and six were degraded by <50% after treatment. Control experiments revealed that sorption to coir fiber and oxidation by manganese oxides were the primary contaminant removal mechanisms. Both the LLE and SPE extracts were used to evaluate potential human toxicity of the hospital wastewaters before and after treatment. Twenty-eight human cell-based bioreceptor assays were used to screen the wastewaters, and secondary tests were run to quantify toxicity equivalents to activated receptors. The wastewaters initially contained organic micropollutants that strongly activated the Androgen Receptor, Estrogen Receptor p, and the Mineralocorticoid Receptor but no bioactive compounds were detected after treatment. Point-of-entry treatment of hospital wastewater should reduce bioactive compounds from entering the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, pesticides and industrial contaminants collectively termed as trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in wastewater has been well-documented in USA, Europe, China and other regions. However, data from India, the second most populous country in the world is severely lacking. This study investigated the occurrence and concentrations of twenty-two indicator TOrCs at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South India serving diverse communities across three sampling campaigns. Samples were collected after each WWTP treatment unit and removal efficiencies for TOrCs were determined. Eleven TOrCs were detected in every sample from every location at all sites, while only five TOrCs were detected consistently in effluent samples. Caffeine was present at greatest concentration in the influent of all three plants with average concentrations ranging between 56 and 65 mu g/L. In contrast, the x-ray contrast media pharmaceutical, iohexol, was the highest detected compound on average in the effluent at all three WWTPs (2.1-8.7 mu g/L). TOrCs were not completely removed in the WWTPs with removal efficiencies being compound specific and most of the attenuation being attributed to the biological treatment processes. Caffeine and triclocarban were well removed (>80%), while other compounds were poorly removed (acesulfame, sucralose, iohexol) or maybe even formed (carbamazepine) within the WWTPs. The effluent composition of the 22 TOrCs were similar within the three WWTPs but quite different to those seen in the US, indicating the importance of region-specific monitoring. Diurnal trends indicated that variability is compound specific but trended within certain classes of compounds (artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals). The data collected on TOrCs from this study can be used as a baseline to identify potential remediation and regulatory strategies in this understudied region of India. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Electrochemical degradation of different effluents polluted with carbamazepine, a well-known refractory pharmaceutical contaminant, was addressed in this article. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q(TM) technology), surface water from a lake and urban wastewater were the matrices used to evaluate the feasibility of performing the electro-oxidation of carbamazepine. Specific designs of experiments were planned for each of the aqueous media. The initial carbamazepine concentration and the electric current density were considered as the operational variables. Although the optimal values of both variables follow the same trend in the three cases, significant differences are observed regarding the comparative influence of each variable on the degradation of carbamazepine.

AB The simultaneous removal of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria by ozone-based advanced oxidation technology (AOT) was investigated for the treatment of anaerobic digestion effluent of piggery wastewater. Chlorotetracycline (CTC) and CTC-resistant bacteria were selected as targets since CTC has been the most used antibiotics in livestock industries in Korea. The performance of four different combinations of oxidation agents was investigated, showing the order of removal rate as O-3 < O-3/H2O2 < O-3/UV < O-3/UV/H2O2 for wastewater. Applications of O-3/UV/H2O2 and O-3/UV degraded almost all CTC within 15 and 20 min, respectively. Only 30% of CTC was degraded even in 40 min by O-3 alone and O-3/H2O2 degraded 65% of CTC in 40 min. The combination of ozone/H2O2 did not contribute significantly to CTC degradation, but the influence of UV was substantial when coupled with ozone. CTC was partially degraded during oxidation although main HPLC peak was completely vanished. The resulting intermediates of partially oxidized CTC possessed no more antibiotic capability, suggesting that CTC transformed into nontoxic organic constituents. For disinfection, ozone alone was not effective for disinfection; less than 2-log reduction was achieved in 1 h. UV was more superior in reducing bacterial population, showing more than 4-log reduction in 20 min and 5-log reduction in 40 min. UV was also effective in reducing both total and CTC-resistant bacterial population, and the contribution ratio of UV to ozone was about 3:1 in logarithmic scale. The application of O-3/UV together further enhanced the disinfection performance compared to UV alone. (C) 2011 The Korean Society of industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study provided the first comprehensive data on the occurrence and removal of twenty-five target emerging contaminants (ECs) in a full-scale water reclamation plant (WRP) in the Southeast Asian region. Nineteen out of the twenty-five ECs were ubiquitously detected in raw influent samples. Concentrations of the detected ECs in raw influent samples ranged substantially from 443 to 124,966 ng/L, depending upon the compound and sampling date. The elimination of ECs in full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems at a local WRP was evaluated and compared. Several ECs, such as acetaminophen, atenolol, fenoprofen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and oxybenzone, exhibited excellent removal efficiencies (>90%) in biological wastewater treatment processes, while some of the investigated compounds (carbamazepine, crotamiton, diclofenac, and iopamidol) appeared to be persistent in the both CAS and MBR systems. Field-based monitoring results showed that MBR outperformed CAS in the elimination of most target ECs. The relationship between molecular characteristics of ECs (Le. physicochemical properties and structural features) and their removal efficiencies during biological wastewater treatment was also elucidated. Excellent removal efficiencies (>90%) were often noted for ECs with the sole presence of electron donating groups (i.e. phenolic [-OH], amine [-NH2], methoxy [-O-CH3], phenoxy [-O-C6H5], or alkyl groups). Conversely, ECs with the absence of electron donating groups or the predominance of strong electron withdrawing groups (e.g. halogenated, carbonyl, carboxyl, and sulfonamide) tended to show poor removal efficiencies (<30%) in biological wastewater treatment processes.

AB Efavirenz is one of the antiretroviral drugs widely used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus. Antiretroviral drugs have been found to be present in surface water and wastewater. Due to complexity of environmental samples, solid-phase extraction (SPE) is used for isolation and pre-concentration of antiretroviral drugs prior to their chromatographic analysis. However, the commercially available SPE sorbents lack selectivity, which tends to prolong the analysis time. Therefore, in this study a molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized for the specific recognition of efavirenz and then applied as the SPE sorbent for its extraction from wastewater and surface water samples. The imprinted and non-imprinted polymers were synthesized using a bulk polymerization technique where efavirenz was used as the template, 2-vinylpyridine as functional monomer, 1,1'-azobis-(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) as initiator, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker and toluene: acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) as the porogenic solvent mixture. The characterization was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-EmmettTeller, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. Results showed better selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymer to efavirenz than did non-imprinted polymer. The analysis was performed using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photo-diode array detector. The analytical method gave a detection limit of 0.41 mu g/L and the analyte recovery of 81% in wastewater. The concentrations found in wastewater ranged from 2.79 to 120.7 mu g/L, while in surface water they were between 0.975 and 2.88 mu g/L. Therefore, the results of this study show a strong need for a detailed screening of efavirenz in major water utilities in the country.

AB Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pollution in animal feeding farms received more public attention recently. Livestock wastewater contains large quantities of antibiotics and ARGs even after traditional lagoon treatment. In this study, the performance of vertical up-flow constructed wetlands (VUF-CWs) on swine wastewater containing tetracycline compounds (TCs) and tet genes was evaluated based on three aspects, TCs and tet genes removal efficiencies, residual TCs and tet genes in soils and plants, and the effect of TCs accumulation on nutrients removal and tet genes development. High removal efficiencies (69.0-99.9%) were achieved for oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC) and chlortetracycline (CTC) with or without OTC spiked in the influent additionally. TCs concentrations in surface soils increased at first two sampling periods and then decreased after plants were harvested. Satisfactory nutrients removal efficiencies were also obtained, but TN and NH4-N removal efficiencies were significantly negative correlated with total concentration of TCs (Sigma TCs) in the soils (p < 0.01). The absolute abundances of all the target genes (tetO, tetM, tetW, tetA, tetX and intI1) were greatly reduced with their log units ranging from 0.26 to 3.3. However, the relative abundances of tetO, tetM and tetX in some effluent samples were significantly higher than those in the influent (p < 0.05). The relative abundances of tet genes except for tetO were significantly correlated with Sigma TCs in the soils (p < 0.05). In summary, the proposed VUF-CWs are effective alternative for the removal of TCs and tet genes. But it is of great importance to prevent large accumulation of TCs in the soils.

AB Most conventional biological treatment wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contain nitrate in the effluent. Nitrate undergoes photolysis when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the 200-240 and 300-325 nm wavelength range. In the process of nitrate photolysis, nitrite and hydroxyl radicals are produced. Medium pressure mercury lamps emitting a polychromatic UV spectrum including irradiation below 240 nm are becoming more common for wastewater disinfection. Therefore, nitrified effluent irradiated with polychromatic UV could effectively become a de facto advanced oxidation (hydroxyl radical) treatment process. UV-based advanced oxidation processes commonly rely on addition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of UV irradiation for production of hydroxyl radicals. This study compares the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl radicals produced by nitrate contained in a conventional WWTP effluent to that produced by typical concentrations of hydrogen peroxide used for advanced oxidation treatment of water. The quantum yield of hydroxyl radical production from nitrate by all pathways was calculated to be 0.24 +/- 0.03, and the quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals from nitrite was calculated to be 0.65 +/- 0.06. A model was developed that would estimate production of hydroxyl radicals directly from nitrate and water quality parameters. In effluents with >5 mg-N/L of nitrate, the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is comparable to that produced by addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2. Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants utilizing polychromatic UV systems at disinfection dose levels can be expected to achieve up to 30% degradation of some micropollutants by hydroxyl radical oxidation. Increasing UV fluence to levels used during advanced oxidation could achieve over 95% degradation of some compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To better understand pharmaceutical fate during wastewater treatment, analysis in both aqueous and particulate phases is needed. Reported herein is a multi-residue method for the determination of ten pharmaceutical drugs and the personal care product triclosan in wastewater matrices. Method quantitation limits ranged from 7.6 to 76.6 ng l(-1) for aqueous phases and from 7.0 to 96.7 ng g(-1) for particulate phases. The analytical method was applied to attain a complete process mass balance of a pilot-scale activated sludge plant (ASP) operated under controlled conditions. The mass balance (inclusive of aqueous and particulate concentrations at all sample points) was used to diagnose removal, revealing pharmaceuticals to be separable into three fate pathways: (a) biological degradation, (b) sorption onto activated sludge and (c) resistant to removal from the aqueous phase. These differences in fate behaviour explained a broad range of secondary removal observed (-8 to 99%). The ASP was also simultaneously compared to a full-scale trickling filter (TF) works whilst receiving the same influent wastewater. Performance of the ASP and TF was similar, achieving total pharmaceutical removals of 253 and 249 mu g g(-1) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removed, respectively. This corresponded with reductions in total pharmaceutical load of 91 and 90% (ANOVA, p-value > 0.05). Interestingly, despite low suspended solid concentrations final effluents of both the ASP and TF contained significant concentrations of some chemicals in the particulate phase. Individually, triclosan and the antibiotics ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were within the particulate phase of effluents at concentrations ranging from 26 to 296 ng l(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The presence of xenobiotics in the aquatic environment has drawn scientific concern due to possible detrimental effects on the ecosystems. With EU Decision 2015/495, a first Watch list of compounds that could potentially represent a threat for the environment was created, with the objective of gathering high quality monitoring data and support their prioritization. Literature data are still very scarce and the presence of many of the compounds has not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, all the 17 compounds of the EU Watch list 2015/495 were monitored in 14 sampling locations, comprised of freshwater and, for the first time, wastewater. The study was carried out in the Ebro delta, in the north east of Spain, a representative and crucial area not only for its environmental and naturalistic significance, but also for Spain's productivity, especially as regards rice agriculture. Results show that contamination originates both from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and agricultural activities. High levels of pharmaceuticals were detected in wastewater, with azithromycin and diclofenac present at mean concentrations of 1.65 mu g/L and 636 ng/L respectively. In freshwater samples, besides antibiotics and diclofenac, substantial contamination by pesticides was reported, with oxadiazon reaching up to 591 ng/L and imidacloprid being present in 93% of samples. Moreover, the study provided insight into the origin of the selected contaminants. The removal of the studied micropollutants in WWTPs was low to moderate. The assessment of risk quotients, calculated based on the available PNECs, demonstrated that the concentrations recorded for these compounds may pose a significant risk in most sampling sites.

AB Numerous studies have analyzed the viability of the biodegradation and removal of different compounds of emerging concern in biological systems for wastewater treatment. However, the effect on the heterotrophic biomass of organic matter removal is sometimes missed. The aim of the present research was to study the effect of the addition of a mix of three pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, and ibuprofen) on the behavior of the biomass in two different membrane-based biological systems treating urban wastewater. The present research studied a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant operating at a similar mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration (about 5.5 g/L). This system works as an MBR and is combined with a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR-MBR) to treat real urban wastewater at 6 and 10 h of hydraulic retention time (HRT) under three different shocks of pharmaceuticals with increasing concentrations. In all cases, the organic matter removal was, in average terms, higher than about 92% of biochemical oxygen demand on the fifth day (BOD5), 79% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 85% of total organic carbon (TOC). Nevertheless, the removal is higher in the MBBR-MBR technology under the same HRT and the MLSS is similar. Moreover, the removal increased during the shock of pharmaceutical compounds, especially in the MBR technology. From a kinetic perspective, MBBR-MBR is more suitable for low HRT (6 h) and MBR is more effective for high HRT (10 h). This could be due to the fact that biofilm systems are less sensitive to hostile environments than the MBR systems. The removal of N-NH4+ decreased considerably when the pharmaceutical compounds mix was introduced into the system until no removal was detected in cycle 1, even when biofilm was present.

AB Agriculture production in California is negatively impacted by soilborne fungi, such as Verticillium dahliae, and limited water availability for irrigation. Some regions have adapted the use of recycling wastewater, i.e., reclaimed water, to supplement the potable water supply. Wastewater purification is not fully efficient at removing all contaminants and small amounts of pharmaceutical products, known as chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), remain. Acetaminophen, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and gemfibrozil are some of the most common CECs found in treated wastewater and were therefore used in this study. These CECs were evaluated for their potential to interact with microorganisms directly, or for their ability to alter the development of Verticillium wilt disease in eggplants. The microorganisms Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Piriformospora indica, Phytopthora capsici, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum were used for in vitro growth assays in the presence of CECs. CECs induced varying responses in strains of the same fungi by promoting growth of one strain while inhibiting growth of the other. CECs influenced spore germination of V. dahliae and F. oxysporum. Greenhouse experiments in which Solanum melongena (eggplants) were inoculated with V. dahliae and irrigated with CECs were used to evaluate the impacts of these chemicals on disease development. Overall our results found that most of the organisms we tested were sensitive to the CECs. P. capsici was found to be the most sensitive microorganism, while B. japonicum growth was unaffected by the CECs at the concentrations used. The greenhouse assays results indicated that plant disease severity may be influenced by given CECs at certain stages of plant growth. Overall the results of this study indicate that the concentrations of CECs found in reclaimed water are occurring at biologically relevant concentrations.

AB Pharmaceuticals as severe contaminants of surface and ground water around the manufacturing communities and residential zones received growing attention recently. Since, there is no report on ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal using electrocoagulation (EC) process by aluminum electrodes, the present work deals with efficient removal of CIP from hospital wastewater using mentioned method. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the main effects of parameters, their simultaneous interactions and quadratic effect to achieve the optimum condition for EC process. According to the obtained results from regression analysis, it was found that the experimental data are best fitted to the second-order polynomial model with coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.9086, adjust correlation coefficient (Adj. R-2) value of 0.8796 and predicted correlation coefficient (pred. R2) value of 0.7834. EC process was applied successfully with removal efficiency of 88.57% under optimal operating condition of pH 7.78, inter-electrode distance 1 cm, reaction time 20 min, current density 12.5 mA cm(-2) and electrolyte dose of 0.07 M NaCl with the initial CIP concentration of 32.5 mg L-1. The experimental efficiency was in satisfactory agreement with the predicted efficiency of 90.34%. The obtained results revealed that, sweep flocculation as a determinant mechanism controlled the adsorption of CIP molecules on aluminum hydroxide precipitates. Electrode consumption and electrical energy consumption were found to be 66.80 g m(-3) and 0.613 kWh m(-3), respectively. The obtained results from real sample analysis revealed that the initial CIP concentration of 1544 61,,g L-1 of hospital wastewater were found to reached to zero after applying optimal condition of EC process.

AB Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug that is not easily degraded in the environment. In this study, the removal of carbamazepine, an emerging contaminant, dissolved in deionized water and wastewater matrices by means of their adsorption onto Humic Acid, Humasorb and Montmorillonite was investigated. The effect of various parameters including adsorption time, adsorbent dosage, and initial adsorbate concentration was determined. The optimum exposure time for the removal of carbamazepine by Humic Acid was 30 min and by Humasorb and Montmorillonite were 2 h, in both distilled and wastewater. The maximum percent removal of carbamazepine by Humic Acid, Humasorb and Montmorillonite in deionized water was 90.5 +/- 3.1%, 85.2 +/- 2.3% and 83.8 +/- 4.5% and in wastewater was 87.0 +/- 1.5%, 87.3 +/- 5.1% and 78.2 +/- 1.2%, respectively, when the initial concentration of carbamazepine was 20 mu g/mL and the mass of absorbent 100 mg in 10 mL samples. Three isotherms models including Langmuir, Freundlich, and Elovich were applied to the experimental data. It was found that the adsorption isotherms for the two adsorbents best matched Langmuir model indicating surface adsorption from deionized water (R (2)= 0.986 for Humic Acid, R (2) = 0.955 for Humasorb and R (2) = 0.865 for Montmorillonite) as well as from wastewater (R (2) = 0.893 for Humic Acid, R (2) = 0.949 for Humasorb and R (2) = 0.984 for Montmorillonite). According to the kinetic studies, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model better fits to the removal of carbamazepine by the three adsorbents from both water matrices. However, pseudo-second-order model cannot exclusively explain the experimental data trend, but it could be explained by diffusion.

AB Composted sewage sludge (CSS) has been extensively used in agriculture and landscaping, offering a practical solution for waste disposal. However, some pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) like triclosan (TCS) and carbamazepine (CBZ) have restricted its land application. In this study, CSS was added to agricultural soil and garden soil at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 25% (w/w soil), and 4 mL of TCS and CBZ stock solution (1000 mg/L in methanol) was spiked into soil amended with CSS of each bottle to arrive at the concentration of 10 mg/kg. Samples were then collected after incubation for 120 days and analyzed for concentrations and half-life (t(1/2)) of TCS and CBZ, and soil physicochemical properties, together with enzyme activities. The results showed that TCS was degraded completely during the incubation period. In contrast, only about 5.82-21.43% CBZ was degraded. CSS amendment inhibited TCS and CBZ degradation and prolonged t(1/2) compared to the control, and the t(1/2) of TCS and CBZ increased with CSS addition amount in all treatments except for CBZ in the garden soil amended with 10% CSS. Correlation studies showed a significantly positive relationship between t(1/2) of TCS and CBZ and total organic carbon (TOC), while a significantly negative relationship between t(1/2) of the two PPCPs and pH was observed. Alkaline phosphatase showed a significantly negative relationship with the C-t/C-0 of TCS in garden soil amended with 25% CSS and CBZ in the control. The urease activity was negatively correlated with the C-t/C-0 of TCS in 10% and 25% CSS treatments and CBZ in 10% CSS treatment for garden soil.

AB Purpose The Todos os Santos Bay is the largest bay in Brazil and receives drainage from various watersheds. For more than 450 years, it was the main destination for the domestic and hospital sewage from the city of Salvador, Bahia. With the growing concern regarding the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment, an investigation was undertaken to determine the presence and levels of some commonly used drugs (i.e., atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, erythromycin, ibuprofen) and personal care products (i.e., galaxolide, tonalide), using sedi-ments as an indicator of their presence in the water column.
   Material and methods Surficial sediment samples from 17 stations located in the intertidal zone of the Todos os Santos Bay and infralittoral zone along the north coast of Salvador were tested for the presence of some PPCPs using LC-MS/MS (for drugs) and GC-MS/MS (for fragrances).
   Results and discussion The PPCPs examined were present in all sediment samples at levels of parts per billion of dry sediment. The highest concentrations were found for the fragrances galaxolide (52.5 ng g(-1)) and tonalide (27.9 ng g(-1)), followed by caffeine (23.4 ng g(-1)) and pharmaceuticals ibuprofen (14.3 ng g(-1)), atenolol (9.84 ng g(-1)), carbamazepine (4.81 ng g(-1)), erythromycin (2.29 ng g(-1)), diclofenac (1.06 ng g(-1)), and diazepam (0.71 ng g(-1)).
   Conclusions Pharmaceuticals were found to be ubiquitous in the sediments of the study areas. The texture of the sediment was an important factor in PPCPs fixation and deposition. The concentrations of all PPCPs had statistically significant positive correlations with the percentage of clay in the sediments.

AB Clofibric acid (CA), a metabolite of lipid regulators, was investigated in ultra-pure water and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent at 10 degrees C under UV, vacuum UV (VUV), UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2 processes. The influences of NO3-, HCO3- and humic acid (HA) on CA photolysis in all processes were examined. The results showed that all the experimental data well fitted the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the apparent rate constant (k(ap)) and half-life time (t(1/2)) were calculated accordingly. Direct photolysis of CA through UV irradiation was the main process, compared with the indirect oxidation of CA due to the slight generation of hydroxyl radicals dissociated from water molecules under UV irradiation below 200 nm monochromatic wavelength emission. In contrast, indirect oxidation was the main CA degradation mechanism in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2, and VUV/H2O2 was the most effective process for CA degradation. The addition of 20 mg L-1 HA could significantly inhibit CA degradation, whereas, except for UV irradiation, the inhibitive effects of NO3- and HCO3- (1.0 x 10(-3) and 0.1 mol L-1, respectively) on CA degradation were observed in all processes, and their adverse effects were more significant in UV/H2O2 and VUV/H2O2 processes, particularly at the high NO3- and HCO3- concentrations. The degradation rate decreased 1.8-4.9-fold when these processes were applied to a real STP effluent owing to the presence of complex constituents. Of the four processes, VUV/H2O2 was the most effective, and the CA removal efficiency reached over 99% after 40 min in contrast to 80 min in both the UV/H2O2 and VUV processes and 240 min in the UV process.

AB A novel osmotic dilution process using commercial liquid fertilizer for greenwall irrigtion was evaluated. In this process, clean water was extracted from raw sewage by forward osmosis (FO) using a well all-purpose commercial liquid fertilizer as draw solution. The diluted liquid fertilizer can then be used for direct sustainable greenwall irrigation. Our results show that the presence of organic matter in the liquid fertilizer draw solution did not compromise FO membrane performance. No discernible changes in water flux and key membrane transport parameters (pure water permeability coefficient, A, and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficient, B) were observed when the organic matter concentration in the draw solution was increased to 2000 mg/L. Parameters influencing the osmotic dilution process were examined in terms of reverse salt flux, liquid fertilizer concentration, cross flow rate, and feed and liquid fertilizer draw solution temperatures. The reverse flux of phosphate was much lower compared to those of ammonium and potassium as the reverse flux of these solutes were proportionally related to theft hydrated radii. Cross-flow rate had no discernible impact on either water flux or reverse nutrient transport. Water and reverse nutrient fluxes increased markedly with increasing temperature, driven by higher water and solute diffusivities. More than 80% water recovery was achieved by osmotic dilution using raw sewage feed. Water production was stable and not affected by deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. By contrast, reverse nutrient diffusion was hindered due to enhanced steric hindrance. Results reported here have significant environmental implications. Extracting clean water from raw sewage by commercial liquid fertilizers harnesses unique FO mass transfer phenomena and balances greenwall nutrient requirement, thereby sustaining the greenvvall irrigation process.

AB Reports of pharmaceuticals in STPs and aquatic systems in the northern hemisphere have surged over the last decade. However, the Australian evidence base is relatively limited, and information on the role of seasonal dilution in attenuation of micropollutants is also scarce. We investigated the removal of 11 PPCPs during sewage treatment in Australia's largest inland STP, and concentrations in the effluent-receiving environment under 2 dilution scenarios. Five treatment stages were sampled, as well as upstream and downstream of the effluent outfall in the Lower Molonglo/Upper Murrumbidgee Catchment, which is dominated by effluent flow during dry periods. Compounds of interest include carbamazepine (CBZ), venlafaxine (VEN), sertraline (SER), fluoxetine (FLX), atenolol (ATL), sotalol (SOT), metoprolol (MET) propranolol (PRL), chlorpheniramine (CHP), diphenhydramine (DPH), and triclosan (TCS). Removal of most pharmaceuticals in the STP was incomplete, although the degree of removal was highly variable for compounds in the same therapeutic class, and for the same compounds in different seasons. Removal efficiency was highest for TCS and lowest for VEN (effluent concentrations 5-7 times higher than influent). Influent mass loads and removal efficiencies of cardiovascular medicines varied considerably. Effluent loads were highest for CBZ, VEN and SOT in both seasons (up to 64 g/day). The dilution conditions were clearly reflected in the 'zone of impact' of PPCPs in the catchment. This study confirms that risk assessment models for PPCPs must account for seasonality of influent loads and removal efficiency of STPs, and site validation is critical for predictive capability. Seasonal dilution can play an important role in ameliorating potentially adverse effects related to mixtures of PPCPs in effluent-impacted systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Medicinal drugs were found to be ubiquitous in the river Elbe, its tributary the river Saale and in other tributaries at their points of entry into the Elbe. The distribution of concentration peaks along the investigated river stretches provides an indication that they are mainly due to the emission of treated waste water from municipal sewage treatment works. This leads to the conclusion that medicinal substances can be regarded as faecal indicators for water pollution caused by human activity. The main substances found in the Elbe in 1998 were diclofenac, ibuprofen and carbamazepine as well as various antibiotics and lipid regulators in the concentration range of <20-140 ng/l. The more thorough investigations carried out in 1999 and 2000 show that in addition to the drugs (phenazone, isopropyl-phenazone and paracetamol) metabolite concentrations contributed significantly to the total concentration of pharmaceuticals in the Elbe. The metamizole metabolites N-acetyl-4-aminoantipyrine (AAA) and N-formyl-4-aminoantipyrine (FAA) were found in concentrations from <20 to 939 ng/l. A multivariate statistical analysis revealed a high correlation in respect of the distribution of persistent substances. The metoprolol distribution throughout the Saale demonstrated that the tributaries cause either an increase (Weise Elster, Unstrut, Ilm) or a reduction (Wipper, Bode) in the concentration, depending on the respective load of waste water. Wide scale sampling in Saxony during 2002 showed the ubiquitous occurrence of carbamazepine in surface waters. The ecotoxicological effects of this contamination cannot be assessed at present. This is due to the fact that no legal framework in respect of these medicinal drugs for human consumption has been established and therefore little research and no risk assessment has been carried out. Therefore it is urgently necessary to include at least the quantitatively most significant substances in the new assessment concept of the EC White Paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Naproxen (2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid) is widely used for the treatment of pain and swelling associated with arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory conditions. Naproxen has been detected in municipal sewage outflows and in surface waters and could reach agricultural land through the application of municipal biosolids or reclaimed water. The persistence characteristics of naproxen in three agricultural soils were investigated. In laboratory microcosms of moist soil incubated at 30 degrees C, [O-(14)CH(3)] naproxen was rapidly and thoroughly mineralized to (14)CO(2) with comparable kinetics in a sandy loam soil, a loam soil, and a silt loam soil. Naproxen mineralization was responsive to soil temperature and soil moisture content, consistent with the primary mechanism of dissipation being biodegradation. Mineralization of naproxen was hastened by the addition of liquid municipal biosolids (LMBs) from a municipal sewage treatment plant that aerated this material. Naproxen was stable in autoclaved soils with or without addition of autoclaved LMBs, whereas naproxen was rapidly mineralized in sterile soil supplemented with nonsterile LMBs. An enrichment culture was obtained from aerobically digested LMBs in a mineral salts medium with naproxen as the sole source of carbon. The culture converted the parent compound to the corresponding naphthol, O-desmethyl naproxen. In summary, naproxen was rapidly removed from soil, with mesophilic aerobic biodegradation being the primary mechanism of dissipation. Microorganisms carried in biosolids enhanced naproxen dissipation in soil, with the initial mechanism of attack likely being O-demethylation. We conclude on this basis that naproxen in soils receiving biosolids would be readily biodegradable and, in the absence of preferential flow or runoff, pose little risk for contamination of adjacent water or crops.

AB This study evaluated the potential concentrations of four antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SUF), trimethoprim (TRI) and erythromycin (ERY) throughout the rivers of Europe. This involved reviewing national consumption rates together with assessing excretion and sewage treatment removal rates. From this information, it was possible to construct best, expected and worst case scenarios for the discharge of these antibiotics into rivers. Consumption data showed surprising variations, up to 200-fold in the popularity of different antibiotics across different European nations. Using the water resources model GWAVA which has a spatial resolution of approximately 6 x 9 km, river water concentrations throughout Europe were predicted based on 31-year climate data. The modelled antibiotic concentrations were within the range of measurements reported previously in European effluents and rivers. With the expected scenario, the predicted annual-average antibiotic concentrations ranged between 0 and 10 ng/L for 90% by length of surface waters. In the worst case scenario concentrations could reach between 0.1 and 1 mu g/L at the most exposed locations. As both predicted and observed sewage effluent concentrations were below reported effect levels for the most sensitive aquatic wildlife, no direct toxicity in rivers is expected. Predicted river concentrations for UP and ERY were closest to effect levels in wildlife, followed by SUF which was 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. TRI appeared to be of the least concern with around 6 orders of magnitude difference between predicted and effect levels. However, mixture toxicity may elevate this risk and antibiotic levels of 0.1-11 mu g/L in hotspots may contribute to local environmental antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.

AB SimpleTreat 3.1 is the sewage treatment plant (STP) model implemented in the European Union (EU) framework for the environmental risk assessment of chemicals. The model was originally designed for neutral hydrophobic chemicals, whereas many substances currently under regulatory scrutiny, are ionizable at environmental pH. Although the model has been adapted to describe ionization (SimpleTreat 3.1), the fate of organic ions is limited to the unbound aqueous phase, which seriously restricts the applicability domain. New regressions were implemented to estimate the sludge-water partition coefficient normalized to organic carbon (K-OC) of monovalent acids and bases from the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW), the dissociation constant (pKa) and the pH. We evaluated the updated model (SimpleTreat 3.2) with 10 test chemicals by comparing predictions with monitoring data collected from the literature. Test chemicals were specifically selected to challenge the applicability domain and to cover a wide range of functionality and physical-chemical properties. Although predicted effluent concentrations are generally conservative, SimpleTreat 3.2 provides reasonable estimates for use in lower-tier risk assessment for neutral and monovalent ionizable chemicals. The accuracy of the new K-OC regressions is acceptable for monovalent acid but is lower for bases, for which measured sludge K-OC is highly recommended. Measured K-OC are also recommended for ionic surfactants and necessary for organic ligands, which may limit the applicability of SimpleTreat using a basic input data set. The conservative nature of model estimates reflects the default worst case, non-numerical parameterization of biodegradation rates and the assumption that biodegradation is limited to the unbound aqueous phase. The potential of refining the description of biodegradation using higher tier simulation tests is explored in a parallel article (Franco et al. this issue).

AB In this study, we analyzed 27 pharmaceuticals in liquid and solid phase samples collected from the unit processes of four different sewage treatment plants (STPs) to evaluate their distribution and behavior of the pharmaceuticals. The examination of the relative distributions of various categories of pharmaceuticals in the influent showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most dominant. While the relative distribution of antibiotics in the influent was not high (i.e., 3%-5%), it increased to 14%-30% in the effluent. In the four STPs, the mass load of the target pharmaceuticals was reduced by 88%-95% mainly in the biological treatment process, whereas the ratio of pharmaceuticals in waste sludge to those in the influent (w/w) was only 2%. In all the STPs, the removal efficiencies for the stimulant caffeine, NSAIDs (acetaminophen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid), and the antibiotic cefradine were high; they were removed mainly by biological processes. Certain compounds, such as the NSAID ketoprofen, contrast agent iopromide, lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, showed varying removal efficiencies depending on the contribution of biodegradation and sludge sorption. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed to compare the pharmaceutical removal efficiencies of the biological treatment processes in the four STPs, which were a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process, sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process, anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) process, and moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process. Among the biological processes, the removal efficiency was in the order of MBR > SBR > A2O > MBBR. Among the tertiary treatment processes investigated, powdered activated carbon showed the highest removal efficiency of 18%-63% for gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, atenolol, cimetidine, and trimethoprim.

AB The in-situ advanced anaerobic digestion (AAD) enhanced with zero-valent iron powder (ZVI) under mesophilic condition was investigated to remove 5 antibiotics (sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), ofloxacin (OFL), tetracycline (TC), and roxithromycin (ROX)) and 11 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (AAC (6)-IB-CR, qnrS, ermF, ermT, ermX, sul1, sul2, sul3, tetA, tetB, and tetG) in sewage sludge. The effects of different ZVI dosages, antibiotic concentrations, and solid retention time (SRTs) on the removal were explored. Also, the correlation coefficient of antibiotics and ARGs, microbial community structure, biogas production and methane yield were analyzed. All conducted treatments operated stably, and the modified Gompertz model described the cumulative methane yield well. The antibiotics, with the exception of OFL, were effectively removed in the sewage sludge at a dosage of 1000 mg/L ZVI, SRT 20 d, and an antibiotic concentration of 20 mu g/L during AAD. The removal rates of SMZ, SMR, TC, and ROX reached 97.39%, 74.54%, 78.61%, and 56.58%, respectively. AAC (6 ')-IB-CR and tetB could be effectively reduced during the in-situ AAD. Through the redundancy analysis, AAC (6 ')-IB-CR, ermT, ermX, sul2, tetB, and tetG had strong positive correlations with the antibiotics in the reactor. The principle component analysis revealed that the community structure was similar when the SRT was 10 d and 20 d at the same amount of ZVI and antibiotic concentrations in the sludge. Under the operating parameters of 1000 mg/L ZVI dosage, SRT 20 d, and an antibiotic concentration of 20 mu g/L, Erysipelotrichia, Verrucomicrobia, Clostridia, Caldiserica, and Alphaproteobacteria of the class were dominated microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion.

AB Drought, rising temperatures, and expanding human populations are increasing water demands. Many countries are extending potable water supplies by irrigating crops with wastewater. Unfortunately, wastewater contains biologically active, long-lived pharmaceuticals, even after treatment. Run-off from farms and wastewater treatment plant overflows contribute high concentrations of pharmaceuticals to the environment. This study assessed the effects of common pharmaceuticals on a cosmopolitan saprophagous insect, Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae). Larvae were reared on artificial diets spiked with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Female flies showed no oviposition preference for treated or untreated diets. Larvae exposed to caffeine in diets showed increased mortality, and larvae fed antibiotics and hormones showed signs of slowed development, especially in females. The normal sex ratio observed in M. scalaris from control diets was affected by exposure to caffeine and pharmaceutical mixture treatments. There was an overall effect of treatment on the flies' microbial communities; notably, caffeine fed insects displayed higher microbial variability. Eight bacterial families accounted for approximately 95% of the total microbes in diet and insects. Our results suggest that CECs at environmentally relevant concentrations can affect the biology and microbial communities of an insect of ecological and medical importance.

AB Worldwide, ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents is increasingly considered in order to decrease the load of organic contaminants before environmental discharge. However, despite the constantly growing knowledge of ozonation over the past few years, the characterization of transformation products (TPs) is still a major concern, particularly because such TPs might remain biologically active. It has been shown for selected tertiary amine pharmaceuticals that they react with ozone and form the corresponding N-oxides. This study therefore applies liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to assess the overall N-oxide formation during the pilot-scale ozonation of a secondary wastewater effluent from a major city in Germany. Sample analysis by LC-HRMS revealed the occurrence of 1,229 compounds, among which 853 were precursors attenuated by ozone and 165 were TPs. Further examination of precursors and TPs using Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect analysis revealed 34 pairs of precursors and products corresponding to a mono-oxygenation. Among these, 27 pairs (16% of all TPs) were consistent with N-oxides since the TP had a higher retention time than the precursor, a characteristic of these compounds. Using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, 10 of these N-oxides could be identified and were shown to be stable during a subsequent filtration step.

AB Background: Environmental monitoring for pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors in the aquatic environment traditionally employs a variety of methods including analytical chemistry, as well as a variety of histological and biochemical endpoints that correlate with the fish fitness. It is now clear that analytical chemistry alone is insufficient to identify aquatic environments that are compromised because these measurements do not identify the biologically available dose. The biological endpoints that are measured are important because they relate to known impairments; however, they are not specific to the contaminants and often focus on only a few known endpoints. These studies can be enhanced by looking more broadly at changes in gene expression, especially if the analysis focuses on biochemical pathways. The present study was designed to obtain additional information for well-characterized sites adjacent to sewage treatment plants in MN that are thought to be impacted by endocrine disruptors.
   Results: Here we examine five sites that have been previously characterized and examine changes in gene expression in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) that have been caged for 48 h in each of the aquatic environments. We find that the gene expression changes are characteristic and unique at each of the five sites. Also, fish exposed to two of the sites, 7 and 12, present a more aggressive behavior compared to control fish.
   Conclusion: Our results show that a short-term exposure to sewage treatment plant effluents was able to induce a site-specific gene expression pattern in the fathead minnow gonad and liver. The short-term exposure was also enough to affect fish sexual behavior. Our results also show that microarray analysis can be very useful at determining potential exposure to chemicals, and could be used routinely as a tool for environmental monitoring.

AB Samples were collected from two stormwater canals and a recreational urban waterway known as Bayou St. John in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA and analyzed for a range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Concentrations of 7 PPCPs and EDCs were measured by a method that provides for simultaneous extraction and quantification of the following compounds: clofibric acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, fluoxetine, clorophene, triclosan, bisphenol A. The method also was used as an indicator of the occurrence of estrogenic compounds by targeting estrone and 17beta-estradiol. The two canals (Orleans and London) are used to drain a portion of the city's stormwater directly into the Mississippi River or Lake Pontchartrain. Bayou St. John is located between the two canals and supplied with water from Lake Pontchartrain. Results from the 6-month sampling period indicated the following concentration ranges for the two stormwater canals: naproxen (ND - 145 ng/l), ibuprofen (ND - 674 ng/l), triclosan (ND - 29 ng/l) and bisphenol A (1.9-158 ng/l). Concentrations of these target analytes increased with cumulative rainfall. For bayou waters, only naproxen (2.1-4.8 ng/l) and bisphenol A (0.9-44 ng/l) were detected. Estrone was detected but determined non-quantifiable for multiple sampling events at the 3 sites. None of the other target analytes (clofibric acid, fluoxetine, clorophene, and 17beta-estradiol) were detected above their method detection levels. Results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of PPCPs and EDCs in New Orleans stormwater canals and Bayou St. John. Results also demonstrate the use of this analytical technique as an indicator of non-point source sewage contamination in New Orleans stormwater canals. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nebivolol (NEB) is one of the top-sold prescription drugs belonging to the third generation of beta-blockers. However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13 ng L-1
   Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254 nm, UV-B at 312 nm and UV-A at 365 nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k = 7.8 x 10(-4) s(-1)). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9 x 10(-4) s(-1) in the presence of the "OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4 x 10(-4) s(-1), Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the C-F bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation energy of aromatic C-F bonds (525 kJ mol(-1)), exceeds the energy of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (>254 nm, i.e., max. 471 kJ (E-)1). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the center dot OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were Phi(deg) = 0.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B Phi(deg) was 0.023 +/- 0.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen. These oxidative species may be formed upon reaction of photo-excited NEB with oxygen. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Discharge of substances like pesticides, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, and chelating agents in surface waters has increased over the last decades due to the rising numbers of chemicals used by humans and because many WWTPs do not eliminate these substances entirely. The study, results of which are presented here, focused on associations of (1) concentrations of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, surface waters, sediments, and tissues of fishes; (2) results of laboratory biotests indicating potentials for effects in these samples and (3) effects either in feral chub (Leuciscus cephalus) from two German rivers (Schussen, Argen) or in brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in bypass systems to streamwater of these rivers or in cages directly in the rivers. The Schussen and Argen Rivers flow into Lake Constance. The Schussen River is polluted by a great number of chemicals, while the Argen River is less influenced by micropollutants. Pesticides, chelating agents, flame retardants, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were detected in effluents of a WWTP discharging to the Schussen as well as in surface water, and/or fishes from downstream of the WWTP. Results obtained by biotests conducted in the laboratory (genotoxicity, dioxin-like toxicity, and embryotoxicity) were linked to effects in feral fish collected in the vicinity of the WWTP or in fishes exposed in cages or at the bypass systems downstream of the WWTP. Dioxin-like effect potentials detected by reporter gene assays were associated with activation of CYP1A1 enzymes in fishes which are inducible by dioxin-like chemicals. Abundances of several PCBs in tissues of fishes from cages and bypass systems were not associated with these effects but other factors can influence EROD activity. Genotoxic potentials obtained by in vitro tests were associated with the presence of micronuclei in erythrocytes of chub from the river. Chemicals potentially responsible for effects on DNA were identified. Embryotoxic effects on zebrafish (Dania rerio), investigated in the laboratory, were associated with embryotoxic effects in trout exposed in streamwater bypass systems at the two rivers. In general, responses at all levels of organization were more pronounced in samples from the Schussen than in those from the Argen. These results are consistent with the magnitudes of chemical pollution in these two streams. Plausibility chains to establish causality between exposures and effects and to predict effects in biota in the river from studies in the laboratory are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The potential of Iris pseudacorus and the associated periphytic biofilm for biodegradation of two common pharmaceutical contaminants (PCs) in urban wastewater was assessed individually and in consortium. An enhanced removal for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was achieved in consortium (59%) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (50%) and periphytic biofilm (7%) at concentration of 5 mg L-1. Conversely, individual sets of periphytic biofilm (77%) outperformed removal of doxylamine succinate (DOX) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (59%) and consortium (67%) at concentration of 1 mg L-1 . Enhanced relative abundance of microflora containing microalgae (Sellaphora, Achnanthidium), rhizobacteria (Acidibacter, Azoarcus, Thio-alkalivibrio), and fungi (Serendipita) in periphytic biofilm was observed after treatment. SMX treatment for five days elevated cytochrome P450 enzymes' expressions, including aniline hydroxylase (48%) and aminopyrine N-demethylase (54%) in the periphytic biofilm. Nevertheless, I. pseudacorus showed 175% elevation of aniline hydroxylase along with other biotransformation enzymes, such as peroxidase (629%), glutathione S-transferase (514%), and dichloroindophenol reductase (840%). A floating bed phytoreactor planted with I. pseudacorus and the periphytic biofilm consortium removed 67% SMX and 72% DOX in secondary wastewater effluent. Thus, the implementation of this strategy in constructed wetland-based treatment could be beneficial for managing effluents containing PCs.

AB The fate of pharmaceuticals during the treatment of effluents is of major concern since they are not completely degraded and because of their persistence and mobility in environment. Indeed, even at low concentrations, they represent a risk to aquatic life and human health. In this work, fourteen pharmaceuticals were monitored in a constructed wetland wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) assessed in both influent and effluent samples. The basic water quality parameters were evaluated, and the removal efficiency of pharmaceutical, potential for bioaccumulation, and the impact of WWTP were assessed using Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) and biofilms. The pharmaceutical compounds were quantified by High Performance Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The sampling campaign was carried out during winter (July/2018) and summer (January/2019). The WWTP performed well regarding the removal of TSS, COD, and BOD5 and succeeded to eliminate a significant part of the organic and inorganic pollution present in domestic wastewater but has low efficiency regarding the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. Biofilms were shown to interact with pharmaceuticals and were reported to play a role in their capture from water. The antibiotics were reported to display a high risk for aquatic organisms.

AB Biotransformation of fatty acids from renewable wastewater as feedstock to value-added chemicals is a fascinating commercial opportunity. alpha,omega-Dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) are building blocks in many industries, such as polymers, cosmetic intermediates, and pharmaceuticals, and can be obtained by chemical synthesis under extreme conditions. However, biological synthesis can replace the traditional chemical synthesis using cytochrome P450 enzymes to oxidize fatty acids to DCAs.Saccharomyces cerevisiaeBY(2R)/pYeDP60-CYP52A17(SS)(BCM), a transgenic strain expressing the galactose-inducible CYP52A17(SS)cytochrome P450 enzyme, was able to grow in a coconut milk factory wastewater (CCW) medium and produced 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (HDDA) and 1,12-dodecanedioic acid (DDA). The supplementation of CCW with 10 g/L yeast extract and 20 g/L peptone (YPCCW) markedly increased the yeast growth rate and the yields of 12-HDDA and 1,12-DDA, with the highest levels of approximately 60 and 38 mu g/L, respectively, obtained at 30 degrees C and pH 5. The incubation temperature and medium pH strongly influenced the yeast growth and 1,12-DDA yield, with the highest 1,12-DDA formation at 30 degrees C and pH 5-5.5. Hence, theS. cerevisiaeBCM strain can potentially be used for producing value-added products from CCW.

AB Antimicrobial agent residues are becoming an intractable environmental problem in soil, surface, and underground water. To obtain a broad profile of residues in animal wastewater and surface water, 24 animal wastewater, 8 animal farm effluent, 18 river water, and 8 pond water samples taken in Jiangsu in eastern China were monitored for enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and florfenicol using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESIMS/MS) techniques. The results revealed that two antibacterials were detected simultaneously in 49.1% of samples, followed by three antibacterials (22.6%) and one antibacterial (22.6%). Up to 3.35, 5.93, and 2.10 mu g L-1 for ciprofloxacin, 1.09, 4.24, and 0.50 mu g L-1 for enrofloxacin, and 0.95, 2.40, and 2.84 mu g L-1 for florfenicol were detected in animal farm-effluent, river, and pond water, respectively. The maximum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in animal wastewaters were 7.49 and 8.77 mu g L-1, respectively. Furthermore, residue levels of ciprofloxacin and florfenicol showed at least two statistical differences between any two sampling areas or two animal farms. Enrofloxacin showed no statistical difference among the sampling areas and the animal farms.

AB This study investigated, using rapid small-scale column testing, the breakthrough of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and eleven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) during granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration of different water qualities, including wastewater, surface water and synthetic water (riverine organic matter dissolved in deionized water). Fluorescing organic matter was better adsorbed than UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in all tested water. Furthermore, highest adsorption of DOM (in terms of DOC, UV254 and fluorescence) was observed during wastewater filtration. UV absorbing DOM had fast and similar breakthrough in surface water and synthetic water, whereas fluorescence breakthrough was very rapid only in synthetic water. PARAFAC modeling showed that different fluorescing components were differently adsorbed during GAC process. Particularly, fluorescing components with maxima intensity at higher excitation wavelengths, which are corresponding to humic-like fluorescence substances, were better removed than other components in all waters. As opposed to DOM, EOCs were better adsorbed during synthetic water filtration, whereas the fastest EOCs breakthrough was observed during filtration of wastewater, which was the water that determined the highest carbon fouling. Exception was represented by long-chained perfluoroalkylated substances (i.e., PFOA, PFDA and PFOS). Indeed, adsorption of these compounds resulted independent of water quality. In this study was also investigated the applicability of UV254 and fluorescing PARAFAC components to act as surrogates in predicting EOCs removal by GAC in different water matrices. Empirical linear correlation for the investigated EOCs were determined with UV254 and fluorescing components in all water qualities. However, fluorescence measurements resulted more sensitive than UV254 to predict EOC breakthrough during GAC adsorption. When the data from all water qualities was combined, good correlations between the microbial humic-like PARAFAC component and EOC removals were still observed and they resulted independent of water quality if considering only real water matrices (wastewater and surface water). On the contrary, correlations between EOC removals and UV254 removals were independent of water quality when combining data of surface waters and synthetic water, but a different correlation model was needed to predict EOCs breakthrough in wastewater.

AB Oxidation of the antimicrobial agent triclosan by aqueous ozone (O-3) was investigated to determine associated reaction kinetics, reaction site(s), and consequent changes in antibacterial activity of triclosan. Specific second-order rate constants, k(O3), were determined for reaction of O-3 with each of triclosan's acid-base species. The value of k(O3) determined for neutral triclosan was 1.3 (+/- 0.1) x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), while that measured for anionic triclosan was 5.1 (+/- 0.1) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1). Consequently, triclosan reacts very rapidly with O-3 at circumneutral pH (the pH-dependent, apparent second-order rate constant, k(app,O3), is 3.8 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7). The pH-dependence of k(app,O3) and comparison of triclosan reactivity toward O-3 with that of other phenolic compounds indicates that O-3 reacts initially with triclosan at the latter's phenol moiety. k(O3) values for neutral and anionic triclosan were successfully related to phenol ring substituent effects via Brown-Okamoto correlation with other substituted phenols, consistent with electrophilic attack of the triclosan phenol ring. Biological assay of O-3-treated triclosan solutions indicates that reaction with O-3 yields efficient elimination of triclosan's antibacterial activity. In order to evaluate the applicability of these observations to actual wastewaters, triclosan oxidation was also investigated during ozonation of effluent samples from two conventional wastewater treatment plants. Nearly 100% triclosan depletion was achieved for a 4 mg/L (8.3 x 10(-5) mol/L) O-3 dose applied to a wastewater containing 7.5 mg/L of DOC, and degrees similar to 58% triclosan depletion for dosage of 6 mg/L (1.3 x 10(-4) mol/L) O-3 to a wastewater containing 12.4 mg/L of DOC. At O-3 doses greater than 1 mg/L (2.1 x 10(-5) mol/L), hydroxyl radical reactions accounted for < 35% of observed triclosan losses in these wastewaters, indicating that triclosan oxidation was due primarily to the direct triclosan-O-3 reaction. Thus, ozonation appears to present an effective means of eliminating triclosan's antibacterial activity during wastewater treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The widely prescribed pharmaceutical metformin and its main metabolite, guanylurea, are currently two of the most common contaminants in surface and wastewater. Guanylurea often accumulates and is poorly, if at all, biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants. This study describes Pseudomonas mendocina strain GU, isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, using guanylurea as its sole nitrogen source. The genome was sequenced with 36-fold coverage and mined to identify guanylurea degradation genes. The gene encoding the enzyme initiating guanylurea metabolism was expressed, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Guanylurea hydrolase, a newly described enzyme, was shown to transform guanylurea to one equivalent (each) of ammonia and guanidine. Guanidine also supports growth as a sole nitrogen source. Cell yields from growth on limiting concentrations of guanylurea revealed that metabolism releases all four nitrogen atoms. Genes encoding complete metabolic transformation were identified bioinformatically, defining the pathway as follows: guanylurea to guanidine to carboxyguanidine to allophanate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The first enzyme, guanylurea hydrolase, is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase protein family, which includes biuret hydrolase and triuret hydrolase. Although homologs, the three enzymes show distinct substrate specificities. Pairwise sequence comparisons and the use of sequence similarity networks allowed fine structure discrimination between the three homologous enzymes and provided insights into the evolutionary origins of guanylurea hydrolase.
   IMPORTANCE Metformin is a pharmaceutical most prescribed for type 2 diabetes and is now being examined for potential benefits to COVID-19 patients. People taking the drug pass it largely unchanged, and it subsequently enters wastewater treatment plants. Metformin has been known to be metabolized to guanylurea. The levels of guanylurea often exceed that of metformin, leading to the former being considered a "dead-end" metabolite. Metformin and guanylurea are water pollutants of emerging concern, as they persist to reach nontarget aquatic life and humans, the latter if it remains in treated water. The present study has identified a Pseudomonas mendocina strain that completely degrades guanylurea. The genome was sequenced, and the genes involved in guanylurea metabolism were identified in three widely separated genomic regions. This knowledge advances the idea that guanylurea is not a dead-end product and will allow for bioinformatic identification of the relevant genes in wastewater treatment plant microbiomes and other environments subjected to metagenomic sequencing.

AB Featured Application This work will allow the development of an efficient, cost-effective and sustainable solution to be used in the removal of pharmaceutical products from wastewaters. It also will contribute to better theoretical and practical knowledge of the three-dimensional electrochemical process as a solution for wastewater treatment. The scientific community is increasingly concerned about the presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, which is a consequence of their high consumption and inefficient removal by wastewater-treatment plants. The search for an effective and sustainable tertiary treatment is therefore needed to enhance their removal. For this purpose, the combination of electrochemical and adsorption processes into three-dimensional (3D) electrochemical systems has been proposed. In this study, a 3D system was studied to remove carbamazepine, an antiepileptic, consumed in high doses and very persistent in the environment. The influences of the following parameters on its removal were evaluated: anode and cathode materials and distance between them, electrolyte (NaCl) concentration and pH, and the (carbon-based) adsorbent material used as the particulate electrode. The obtained results demonstrated that the introduction of the particulate electrode improved the removal efficiency. This can be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of different phenomena, such as adsorption/electrosorption, electrocoagulation, oxidation, and catalytic degradation.

AB Activated carbon is used increasingly in the post-treatment of municipal wastewater in order to reduce micropollutant loads in aquatic systems. However, there is lack of knowledge concerning the capacity and kinetics of adsorption on activated carbon. Using treated municipal wastewater spiked with organic micropollutants in this study assesses the elimination efficiency of six different activated carbon products and investigates the adsorption capacity and kinetics of these products. Elimination efficiency was assessed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole. A comparison of different isotherm equations using equivalent molar radius and Stokes radius as parameters was also investigated focusing on adsorption kinetics as well as adsorption isotherms. Kinetics of DOC elimination were comparable for all activated carbons tested with an elimination of about 50% occurring within the first 5-10 min. Carbamazepine and diclofenac showed high elimination of more than 90% with carbon dosages of 5 mg/L or more. For benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole 90% elimination could only be achieved with carbon dosages of 20 mg/L or more, depending on the activated carbon used. Analytical data for micropollutant elimination were found to be best represented by Freundlich isotherm.

AB The presence of pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is an ecological concern. The issue could be alleviated by trapping those substances by cyclodextrin (CD) polymers or photolyzing them by pulsed light (PL). Consequently, a sequential CD polymer/PL system was tested for the removal of PhCs. Firstly, a survey detected the presence of recurrent PhCs in the effluents of local WWTPs. Then, pure water was spiked with 21 PhCs, 100 mu g/L each one. The three-dimensional network provides amphiphilic features to the CD polymer that reduced the pollutant concentration by 77 %. Sorption involves a plead of physical and chemical mechanisms hindering the establishment of a general removal model for all compounds. The performed simulations hint that the retention capacity mainly correlates with the computed binding en-ergies, so that theoretical models are revealed as valuable tools for further improvements. The complementary action of PL rose the elimination to 91 %. The polymer can be reused at least 10 times for ibuprofen (model compound) removal, and was able to eliminate the ecotoxicity of an ibuprofen solution. Therefore, this novel sequential CD polymer/PL process seems to be an efficient alternative to eliminate PhCs from wastewater.

AB The manufacturing of the antiepileptics, carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (oxCBZ), results in generation of wastewater containing these micropollutants which exhibit toxicity even at trace levels. Therefore, we focused on monitoring their fate and removal in various units of a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using mass balance approach. An apparent CBZ removal of 50 +/- 3% was observed by conventional activated sludge process in the biological treatment unit, whereas oxCBZ still persisted after the biological treatment and showed negative mass balance. However, reverse osmosis resulted in 91% oxCBZ removal, whereas CBZ still continued to persist as a result of lower solubility of CBZ as compared to oxCBZ. Only 3% CBZ exhibited sorption onto the suspended solids and sludge, which was negligible for oxCBZ, thus demonstrating their tendency to remain in aqueous phase. Additionally, we attempted to understand the fundamental mechanism behind the removal of these pharmaceuticals and it was apparently the collective effect of sorption, mineralization, biotransformation, biodegradation, phototransformation/photodegradation, etc. Thus, the integrative data presented in the present study on productivity of these pharmaceuticals, their mass loading in influent and effluents allied with their removal efficiency will be significantly constructive in benchmarking the operational effectiveness through operational optimization and design improvement of the current conventional treatment plant.

AB Photocatalytic ozonation was employed for the first time in continuous mode with TiO2-coated glass Raschig rings and light emitting diodes (LEDs) to treat urban wastewater as well as surface water collected from the supply area of a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Different levels of contamination and types of contaminants were considered in this work, including chemical priority substances (PSs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), as well as potential human opportunistic antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes (ARB&ARG). Photocatalytic ozonation was more effective than single ozonation (or even than TiO2 catalytic ozonation) in the degradation of typical reaction by-products (such as oxalic acid), and more effective than photocatalysis to remove the parent micro pollutants determined in urban wastewater. In fact, only fluoxetine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were detected after photocatalytic ozonation, by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) pre-concentration and LC-MS/MS analysis. In surface water, this treatment allowed the removal of all determined micropollutants to levels below the limit of detection (0.01-0.20 ng L-1). The efficiency of this process was then assessed based on the capacity to remove different groups of cultivable microorganisms and housekeeping (16S rRNA) and antibiotic resistance or related genes (intl1, blaTEM, qnrS, sul1). Photocatalytic ozonation was observed to efficiently remove microorganisms and ARGs. Although after storage total heterotrophic and ARB (to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem), fungi, and the genes 16S rRNA and intl1, increased to values close to the pre-treatment levels, the ARGs (blaTEM, qnrS and sul1) were reduced to levels below/close to the quantification limit even after 3-days storage of treated surface water or wastewater. Yeast estrogen screen (YES), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were also performed before and after photo catalytic ozonation to evaluate the potential estrogenic activity, the cellular metabolic activity and the cell viability. Compounds with estrogenic effects and significant differences concerning cell viability were not observed in any case. A slight cytotoxicity was only detected for Caco-2 and hCMEC/D3 cell lines after treatment of the urban wastewater, but not for L929 fibroblasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are normally barely removed by conventional wastewater treatments. Advanced technologies as a post-treatment, could prevent these pollutants reaching the environment and could be included in a centralized treatment plant or, alternatively, at the primary point source, e.g. hospitals. In this study, the environmental impacts of different options, as a function of several advanced treatments as well as the centralized/decentralized implementation options, have been evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. In previous publications, the characterization of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals within LCA suffers from high uncertainties. In our study, LCA was therefore only used to quantify the generated impacts (electricity, chemicals, etc.) of different treatment scenarios. These impacts are then weighted by the average removal rate of pharmaceuticals using a new Eco-efficiency Indicator EFI. This new way of comparing the scenarios shows significant advantages of upgrading a centralized plant with ozonation as the post-treatment. The decentralized treatment option reveals no significant improvement on the avoided environmental impact, due to the comparatively small pollutant load coming from the hospital and the uncertainties in the average removal of the decentralized scenarios. When comparing the post-treatment technologies, UV radiation has a lower performance than both ozonation and activated carbon adsorption.

AB Nitration reactions of aromatic compounds are commonly involved in different industrial processes for pharmaceutical, pesticide or military uses. For many years, most of the manufacturing sites used lagooning systems to treat their process effluents. In view of a photocatalytic degradation assay. the wastewater of a lagoon was investigated by using HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. The wastewater was highly concentrated in RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) and two herbicides Dinoterb (2-tert-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol) and Dinoseb (2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol). First of all, an analytical method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with HPLC ESI MS/MS was put in work for identification and titration of RDX, HMX and the two dinitrophenols in a complex natural matrix. Then, the UV/TiO2 treatment was investigated for pollutants removal. Dinitrophenolic compounds were significantly degraded after a 8-h-exposition of the wastewater/TiO2 suspension, whereas RDX and HMX were poorly affected. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In water/soil systems, the iodinated contrast medium iopromide was quantitatively biotransformed into several transformation products (TPs). Twelve TPs were identified via HPLC-UV and LC tandem MS. The chemical structures of the TPs were elucidated via fragmentation in MS(2) and MS(3) of LC tandem MS with a linear ion trap and (1)H and (13)C NMR analyses. All TPs exhibited transformations at the side chains containing either carboxylic moieties and/or primary and secondary amide moieties, while the triiodoisophthalic acid structure remained unaltered. A transformation pathway was proposed based on the sequence of TP formation in aerobic batch experiments. Additionally, the occurrence of iopromide TPs was investigated in native water samples. All TPs identified were found in municipal WWTP effluents because of their formation during biological wastewater treatment with maximum concentrations of up to 3.7 +/- 0.9 mu g/L (TP 819). Predominantly, those TPs were present at higher concentrations in WWTP effluents which were formed at the beginning of the transformation pathway. Furthermore, four TPs formed at the end of the transformation pathway (TP 759, 701A/B, and 643) were also found in bank filtrate up to 0.050 mu g/L and in groundwater of an wastewater irrigation area up to 4.6 mu g/L.

AB The objective of this study was to develop an innovative and advanced integrated "membrane and oxidation" system for the treatment of domestic wastewater by coupling membrane bioreactor (MBR), nanofiltration (NF) and ozonation. Five contaminants were selected (acetaminophen, carbamazepin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracyclin and terbutryn). The MBR effluent samples have been fully characterized using conventional analysis (COD, TOC, UV254, ionic chromatography...) and advanced characterization analyses (3D fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (3DEEM)) before being spiked with 1 ppm of each of the selected pharmaceuticals. NF process experiments were carried out in batch and semi-batch mode using a flat sheet membrane system (NF-90). Selected OMPs were well rejected by NF (between 84 % and 98 %) and the main fouling mechanisms observed were pore blocking and gel layer formation. MBR effluent was then pre-treated in an ozonation pilot unit's with ozone gas inlet fixed at 5 g.Nm(-)(3).The complete degradation by ozonation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole took 15-20 min and more than 30 min for terbutryn. Acetaminophen, tetracyclin and dissolved organic matter were almost totally ozonated in 5 min. The overall mineralization rate was low. The pre-ozonation enables the NF fouling resistance to be decreased by almost 40 %.

AB This study gives a full overview of the chemical oxidation by ozone of selected xenobiotics usually present in effluents of conventional wastewater treatment plants. A qualitative and quantitative overview of literature data was made, and describes the ozonation efficiency and processes for the elimination of 12 xenobiotics (pesticides and pharmaceuticals). A database was built, compiling literature results of experimental ozonation assays in laboratory and real-scale conditions. Special attention was paid to selecting the data and compiling reliable results on removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters. An original study was performed in a semi-batch reactor applying ozone on secondary effluent spiked beforehand with a cocktail of 12 xenobiotics. The results of this study were compared with the literature data to evaluate the influence of the kinetic competition of xenobiotics in spiked wastewater in the determination of kinetic rate constants. These 12 xenobiotics were classified into three groups (high-/medium-/low-oxidizable) according to the ranges of their direct kinetic rate constants (k(O3)). A best effective ozone dose between 0.2 and 0.4 g(O3) gDOC(-1) is proposed for the elimination of xenobiotics. The predominant elimination pathway between direct and indirect oxidation was identified for each xenobiotic.

AB The present study dealt with the interaction of dichloromethane (DCM) with other non-chlorinated organic solvents such as methanol, acetone, toluene, and benzene, which are commonly present in the pharmaceutical wastewater, during biodegradation by mixed bacterial consortium. Non-chlorinated solvents were easily degradable even at an initial concentration of 1,000 mg/L, whereas only 20 mg/L of DCM was degraded when used as sole carbon source. The Monod Inhibition model appears to simulate the single pollutant biodegradation kinetics satisfactorily. In dual substrate systems, low concentrations (100 mg/L) of non-chlorinated solvents did not interfere with the DCM degradation. Non-interaction sum kinetics model was able to simulate the experimental results well in this case. However, high concentrations of non-chlorinated solvents (1,000 mg/L) affected the DCM degradation significantly. There was severe competition between the chlorinated and the non-chlorinated solvents. In this case, competitive inhibition model predicted the experimental results better compared to co-metabolism model. In multiple substrate system also, presence of DCM prolonged the degradation of the other non-chlorinated solvents. However, the presence of non-chlorinated compounds accelerated the degradation of DCM. The results of the present study may be helpful in optimal design of biological systems treating mixed pollutants.

AB In this study the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was subjected to ozone treatment. Solutions of 60 mg/L and 100 mu g/L SMX in pure water and secondary municipal effluent were treated. The removal profile of SMX and its oxidation products was monitored as a function of transferred ozone dose in both matrices. No difference was observed in the ozone dose required for the concentration of SMX to fall below the limit of detection in pure water and wastewater. New peaks with the same retention times were obtained on the HPLC chromatograms for all conditions studied. Solutions with an initial concentration of 60 mg/L required 83 mg/L of ozone to fall below the limit of detection and eight oxidation products were detected. Solutions with an initial concentration of 100 mu g/L required 14 mg/L of ozone and only four oxidation products were detected. The four peaks obtained during experiments at low concentration were observed at the same retention times as four of the peaks obtained in higher concentration samples. In ozonated wastewater these products were identified as: 4-aminobenzene sulfonamide, N-(3-phenylpropyl)-acetamide, 2-methyl-benzoxazole and phenol. In addition, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were identified in the higher concentration samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to investigate long-term effect of cefalexin (CFX) on the performance of expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) system and microbial community structure, two 1.47 L EGSB reactors E1 and E2 were designed and run for 224 days treating with synthetic antibiotic wastewater. For the purpose of comparison, E1 was fed with synthetic antibiotic industry wastewater with CFX added as the test reactor, while, E2 was fed without any CFX added as the control reactor (E2). The addition of CFX resulted in the continual increasing of soluble COD (sCOD) and accumulation of VFAs in the effluent of E1 system. Besides, it was found that the accumulation of CFX by-products D-1, D-2 and D-3 was negative correlation with sCOD removal efficiency. Furthermore, the microbial community structures were also investigated. For the bacterial community, Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus which can ferment propionate and other organic pollutants as their substrate were obviously enriched in E1 system. For the archaea, there was more functional diversity in E1 system than in E2 system. Furthermore, fungi also played an important role on the removal of complex organics in E1 system.

AB The majority of current wastewater treatment plants are unable to effectively eliminate micropollutants like pharmaceuticals. This specific type of pollution, which is currently not regulated in today's legislation, goes to a greater or lesser extent into surface streams and then into groundwaters. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in groundwater was addressed by only few studies till now and should be considered by new researches in different localities with different conditions. Monitoring of groundwater quality in the area of the psychiatric hospital at Horni BeA (TM) kovice showed that local groundwater contains a range of pharmaceuticals. The geological environment is able to effectively eliminate many of them (e.g. estrogens) over a relatively short distance, but in the case of other pharmaceuticals the efficacy of elimination of groundwater pollution is significantly lower (e.g. diclofenac). The results of the project disclosed a series of related, yet unresolved issues and unanswered questions. Development of ecological thresholds will enable determination of the danger of pharmaceuticals to the environment and human health from prolonged exposure to low doses of these drugs. The results achieved will have a significant economic impact because new limits of permissible concentrations of these compounds in water will lead to new demands for efficient technologies of wastewater treatment.

AB Cephalosporins type antibiotics are widely used to treat infectious diseases. Their determination is not only important in blood/serum of patients under treatment but also in diverse matrices like wastewaters, milk etc. as contaminant. Keeping in view the need, a new high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of three cephalosporins (cefradine, cefuroxime and cefotaxime) has been developed. Separation was performed on an ODS column with binary solvent elution of aqueous formic acid (0.05%) and methanol in the ratio of 45: 55 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1) and UV detection at 260 nm. Under optimised conditions, all three cephalosporins were baseline separated within 5 min. Linear responses for cefradine 5-20 mu g mL(-1), cefuroxime 0.5-15 mu g mL(-1) and cefotaxime 1.0-20 mu g mL(-1) were established. LOD of 0.05-0.25 mu g mL(-1) after preconcentration was achieved. The method was applied to serum samples of patients under treatment with these antibiotics and to screen the selected cephalosporins from hospital wastewater and milk samples. Moreover, method was applied to study stability of aqueous solutions and acid/base induced degradation of all three drugs.

AB Hydrophobic aerogels were used to remove three types of persistent organic pollutants: pharmaceutical drugs (i.e. doxorubicin [DOX], paclitaxel [TAX]), phthalates (diethyl phthalate [DEP]), and hydrophilic rhodamine dye (RhB) from synthetic and real wastewaters, using Lumira granular aerogel from Cabot activated with EtOH (ET-GAG). The hydrophobic silica aerogel was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The pollutants were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV and HPLC-mass spectrometry. The adsorption process was governed by hydrophobic- hydrophobic interactions between the ET-GAG and micropollutants. The adsorption capacity of ET-GAG, examined by batch experiments, for DOX, TAX and DEP were 13.80, 14.28 and 17.54 mg/g respectively. The rate of adsorption to ET-GAG is high in the initial 40 min followed by no change in the rate due to saturation of adsorption sites. ET-GAG was able to completely remove micropollutants from real leachate and hospital wastewater, implying practical applications. Regeneration of the aerogel was studied by solvent extraction. Et-GAG adsorbent demonstrated better removal of toxic chemotherapeutic drugs and phthalates than GAC.

AB Triclosan (TCS) is one of the most widespread emerging contaminants and has adverse impact on aquatic ecosystem, yet little is known about its complete biodegradation mechanism in bacteria. Sphingomonas sp, strain YL-JM2C, isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant, was very effective on degrading TCS. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the conditions like temperature and pH. From RSM, the optimal TCS degradation conditions were found to be 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. Under optimal conditions, strain YL-JM2C completely mineralized TCS (5 mg L-1) within 72 h. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2-chlorohydroquinone and hydroquinone are three main by-products of TCS. Furthermore, stable isotope experimental results revealed that the C-13(12)-TCS was completely mineralized into CO2 and part of heavier carbon (C-13) of labeled TCS was utilized by strain YL-JM2C to synthesize fatty acids (PLFAs). Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and degradation test results suggested that the strain could enhance degradation capacity of TCS through increasing CSH. In addition, the bacterium also completely degraded spiked TCS (5 mg L-1) in wastewater collected from the wastewater treatment plant. Hence, these results suggest that the strain has potential to remediate TCS in the environment.

AB A LC tandem MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of four iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and 46 ICM biotransformation products (TPs) in raw and treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. Recoveries ranged from 70% to 130%, and limits of quantification (LOQ) varied between 1 ng/L and 3 ng/L for surface water, groundwater and drinking water, and between 10 ng/L and 30 ng/L for wastewater. In a conventional wastewater treatment plant, iohexol, iomeprol, and iopromide were transformed to >80%, while iopamidol was transformed to 35%. In total, 26 TPs were detected above their LOQ in WWTP effluents. A significant change in the pattern of ICM TPs was observed after bank filtration and groundwater infiltration under aerobic conditions. Predominately, these TPs are formed at the end of the microbial transformation pathways in batch experiments with soil and sediment. These polar ICM TPs, such as iohexol TP599, iomeprol TP643, iopromide TP701A, and iopromide TP643, were not or only partially removed during drinking water treatment. As a consequence, several ICM TPs were detected in drinking water, at concentration levels exceeding 100 ng/L, with a maximum of 500 ng/L for iomeprol TP687.

AB The wastewaters produced in many different operations in the pharmaceutical industry are considered as an environmental problem because of their hazardous and potential for impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the treatment of pharmaceutical industry wastewater by combination of electrocoagulation (EC), electro-Fenton (EF) and photocatalytic oxidation (PcO) processes was investigated. Initially, EF or EC processes were applied to degrade and decompose recalcitrant organic pollutants and PcO was then sequentially carried out to remove total organic carbon (TOC) and mineralise remaining compounds from wastewater. The performance of sequential implementation of EC + EF, EC + PcO and EF + PcO processes was investigated by using different current densities, catalysts, reaction times and process order. The most effective degradation was observed in the 1 h EF using 5 mA/cm(2) pulsed current density and optimum Fe:H2O2 molar ratio as 1:10 and then 4 h PcO using 1.5 g/L TiO2 and 10 mM H2O2. Results of sequential treatment processes indicated 64.0 % Total Organic Carbon (TOC), 70.2 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and 97.8 % Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) reduction and the energy consumptions were also calculated as 1051.21 kW h/kg TOC at 1 h EF and 4 h PcO.

AB Fish can be exposed to a complex mixture of chemical contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, present in discharges of wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) effluents. There is little information on the effects of effluent exposure on fish metabolism, especially the small molecule signaling compounds which are the biological target of many pharmaceuticals. We applied a newly developed sensitive nanoflow-nanospray mass spectrometry nontargeted profiling technique to identify changes in the exposome and metabolome of roach (Rutilus rutilus) exposed to a final WwTWs effluent for 15 days. Effluent exposure resulted in widespread reduction (between 50% and 90%) in prostaglandin (PG) profiles in fish tissues and plasma with disruptions also in tryptophan/serotonin, bile acid and lipid metabolism. Metabolite disruptions were not explained by altered expression of genes associated with the PG or tryptophan metabolism. Of the 31 pharmaceutical metabolites that were detected in the effluent exposome of fish, 6 were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but with plasma concentrations too low to disrupt PG biosynthesis. PGs, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites are important mediators regulating a diverse array of physiological systems in fish and the identity of wastewater contaminants disrupting their metabolism warrants further investigation on their exposure effects on fish health.

AB The photochemical degradation of five pharmaceuticals was examined in two secondary wastewater effluents. The compounds, which included atenolol, carbamazepine, meprobamate, phenytoin and primidone, were evaluated for both direct and sensitized photolysis. In the two wastewaters, direct photolysis did not lead to significant compound degradation; however, sensitized photolysis was an important removal pathway for the five pharmaceuticals. Upon solar irradiation, hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) was quantified using the hydroxylation of benzene and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) formation was monitored following the degradation of furfuryl alcohol. Degradation via sensitized photolysis was observed following five-day exposures for atenolol (69-91%), carbamazepine (67-98%), meprobamate (16-52%), phenytoin (44-85%), and primidone (34-88%). Varying removal is likely a result of the differences in reactivity with transient oxidants. Averaged steady state HO center dot concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 4.0 x 10(-16) M, whereas the concentrations of O-1(2) were 6.0-7.6 x 10(-14) M. Partial removal due to presence of HO center dot indicates it was not the major sink for most compounds examined. Other transient oxidants, such as O-1(2) and triplet state effluent organic matter, are likely to play important roles in fates of these compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An effective, specific and accurate method is presented for the quantification of 13 markers of anthropogenic contaminants in water using solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Validation was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Method recoveries ranged from 77 to 114% and limits of quantification between 0.75 and 4.91 ng/L. A study was undertaken to quantify the concentrations and loadings of the selected contaminants in 6 sewage treatment works (STW) effluent discharges as well as concentrations in 5 rain-driven street runoffs and field drainages. Detection frequencies in STW effluent ranged from 25% (ethinylestradiol) to 100% (benzoylecgonine, bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS) and diclofenac). Average concentrations of detected compounds in STW effluents ranged from 3.62 ng/L (ethinylestradiol) to 210 ng/L (BPA). Levels of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) as well as the plasticiser BPA were found in street runoff at maximum levels of 1160 ng/L, 647 ng/L and 2405 ng/L respectively (8.52, 3.09 and 2.7 times more concentrated than maximum levels in STW effluents respectively). Rain-driven street runoff may have an effect on levels of PFCs and plasticisers in receiving rivers and should be further investigated. Together, this method with the 13 selected contaminants enables the quantification of various markers of anthropogenic pollutants: inter alia pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and their metabolites from humans and improper disposal of drugs, while the plasticisers and perfluorinated compounds may also indicate contamination from industrial and transport activity (street runoff).

AB Every year millions of tons of chemical products are disposed to the environment as a result of human activities, with deleterious consequences to biodiversity. In Europe the biodiversity policy basis for action is provided by the Birds and the Habitats Directives. According to these directives a network of protected areas is being built across EU countries encompassing the Natura 2000 Network. But the management plans of these protected areas do not require an ecotoxicological assessment of chemicals used within its limits. As for risk assessment protocols described in EC pieces of legislation and technical guidance documents, they are generic guidelines that not take into consideration regional particularities, e.g. the Mediterranean ecoregion specificities, and its local ecological values. Herewith we present a conceptual model for the assessment of risks posed by agriculture to bird species of conservationist concern from Natura 2000 Network sites; an example is set in a cereal steppe of the Iberian Peninsula. Hazards identified are related to the utilization of herbicides, disposal of sewage sludge to be used as fertilizer, and the input of veterinary pharmaceuticals that can be found in livestock dung and urine. This innovative model, to be used in high tier risk assessment, takes into account the biotic parameters of the protected bird species: great bustard (Otis tarda), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), and montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus). The transfer of chemicals is considered to occur mainly through a realistic trophic chain scenario according to the different feeding behaviour among different species and even within the same species when having different feeding habits (e.g. adults and juveniles). Moreover, the probabilistic approach is proposed in order to perform a transparent risk assessment and clearer risk communication. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Overuse of antibiotics has resulted in widespread contamination of the environment and triggered antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not equipped to remove antibiotics. Effluents from WWTPs are usually the primary source of antibiotics in aquatic environments. There is an urgent need for cost-effective, environment-friendly technologies to address this issue. Along with antibiotics, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) are also present in conventional WWTP effluents at high concentrations, causing environmental problems like eutrophication. In this study, we tested vetiver grass in a plug flow reactor-based constructed wetland model in a greenhouse setup for removing antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP) and tetracycline (TTC), and nutrients, N and P, from secondary wastewater effluent. The constructed wetland was designed based on a previous batch reaction kinetics study and reached a steady-state in 7 days. The measured concentrations of antibiotics were generally consistent with the modeling predictions using first-order reaction kinetics. Vetiver grass significantly (p < 0.05) removed 93% and 97% of CIP and TTC (initial concentrations of 10 mg/L), simultaneously with 93% and 84% nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Results show that using vetiver grass in constructed wetlands could be a viable green technology for the removal of antibiotics and nutrients from wastewater.

AB The next challenge of wastewater treatment is to reliably remove micro-pollutants at the microgram per litre range in order to meet the environmental quality standards set by new regulations like the Water Framework Directive. The present work assessed the efficiency of different types of primary, secondary and tertiary processes for the removal of more than 100 priority substances and other relevant emerging pollutants through on-site mass balances over 19 municipal wastewater treatment lines. Secondary biological processes proved to be in average 30% more efficient than primary settling processes. The activated sludge (AS) process led to a significant reduction of pollution loads (more than 50% removal for 70% of the substances detected). Biofilm processes led to equivalent removal efficiencies compared to AS, except for some pharmaceuticals. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) process allowed to upgrade removal efficiencies of some substances only partially degraded during conventional AS processes. Preliminary tertiary processes like tertiary settling and sand filtration could achieve significant removal for adsorbable substances. Advanced tertiary processes, like ozonation, activated carbon and reverse osmosis were all very efficient (close to 100%) to complete the removal of polar pesticides and pharmaceuticals; less polar substances being better retained by reverse osmosis.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CPX), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is found in the bulk effluents emerged from pharmaceutical industries. Its presence in the effluent may lead to toxicity to the aquatic life and antimicrobial resistance. Hence, the oxidative degradation of CPX by classical Fenton's process was investigated for the present study. The maximum CPX and total organic carbon (TOC) removal from the synthetic wastewater (initial CPX concentration = 100 mg L-1) were 70% and 55%, respectively, under the best reaction conditions ([H2O2]:[Fe2+] = 10, stoichiometric H2O2 concentration = 14.2 mM and initial wastewater pH = 3.0). Five major degradation products could be identified by high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HR LC-MS) which could have resulted by the occurrence of decarboxylation, defluorination, hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring. The time based detection of ferrous and ferric ions in aqueous phase confirmed the CPX degradation by hydroxyl radicals. A pathway has been proposed for CPX degradation by Fenton's process based on the kinetic decay and/or evolution profiles of CPX and intermediates as well as the release of inorganic ions into the aqueous solution. It was indicated from the rapid respirometric test that the wastewater toxicity was lowered after Fenton's treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The toxicity of pharmaceutical wastewaters has recently been the focus of the public in China. This study aimed to evaluate the conventional pollution parameters and toxicities of different raw and treated pharmaceutical wastewaters to algae Scenedesmus obliquus and bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Wastewater samples were collected from 16 pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants in China. The results of the conventional parameters analysis indicated that the total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) were largely removed after treatment. Pharmaceutical effluents were mainly polluted with organics and phosphorus as indicated by the average COD (388 mg/L) and TP (3.16 mg/L) concentrations. The toxicity test results indicated that the influent samples were toxic to both test species. Although the toxicities could be remarkably reduced after treatment, 10 out of the 16 effluent samples exceeded the acute toxicity discharge limit of the Chinese national standards. Spearman rank correlation coefficients indicated a significantly positive correlation between the toxicity values of S. obliquus and V. fischeri. Compared with S. obliquus, V. fischeri detected more pharmaceutical effluent samples with toxicities. Meanwhile, the toxicity indicators were significantly and positively correlated with the COD and NH3-N concentrations based on a Spearman rank correlation analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents are a current and emerging global problem and the development of cost-effective methods to facilitate their removal is needed to mitigate this issue. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), in particular UV/TiO2, have potential for wastewater treatment. In this study, TiO2 anatase phase nanobelts (30-100 nm in width and 10 mu m in length) have been synthesized using a high temperature hydrothermal method as a means to photocatalyze the oxidation of pharmaceutical contaminants. We have investigated a model dye (malachite green), three pharmaceuticals and personal care products-naproxen, carbamazepine, and theophylline-that are difficult to oxidize without AOP processes. TiO2 nanobelts were exposed to 365 nm UV illumination and the measured photocatalytic degradation rates and adsorption parameters of pharmaceuticals were explored using kinetic models. Furthermore we have determined the degree of pharmaceutical degradation as a function of solution pH, illumination time, temperature, and concentration of contaminant. In addition, the roles of active oxygen species-hydroxyl radial (OH center dot), positive holes (h(+)), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-involved were also investigated in the degradation process. These studies offer additional applications of hierarchical TiO2 nanobelt membranes, including those harnessing sunlight for water treatment.

AB Often, different types of contaminants in wastewater are suspected of adversely affecting the treatment efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Therefore, it is essential to study the effects of newly synthesized substances on the activity of activated sludge microorganisms. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of innovative biosurfactants, i.e., sophorolipids quaternary ammonium salts (SQAS), and three common micropollutants (MPs), i.e., diclofenac (DCP), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and 4-nonylenol (4-NP), on the biochemical activity of activated sludge microorganisms. The effect of all tested substances was more significant on nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) than on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and least on the respiratory activity of heterotrophic organisms (HET). SQAS inhibited nitrification even at the lowest concentration tested (5 mg L-1) and the inhibition degree was in the range of 37% to 78%; at the highest concentration of SQAS studied (160 mg L-1), it was about 45-96%. In most cases, the degree of inhibition increased when the SQAS concentration approached 80-160 mg L-1. MPs influenced the activity of nitrifiers to a lower extent than SQAS. The inhibition degree varied from 25% to 75%, depending on the micropollutant tested and its concentration.

AB In this study, an experimental design was used to optimize dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for the extraction/preconcentration of micropollutants that have endocrine disruption potential, for the determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analytes were selected from endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as pesticides, phthalates, hormones, alkyl phenols and pharmaceuticals. The most influential parameters of the extraction method determined in a pre-optimization step were included in the design model to determine their optimum amounts and to evaluate their interactions in a series of combinations. The design model predictor was used to obtain optimum experimental values, with which analytical performance of each analyte was determined with calibration plots. Deuterated bisphenol A (BPA D16) was added as an internal standard to all samples and calibration standards to improve the precision of the results. The limits of detection for analytes ranged between 0.10 and 16 mu g/L. The developed method was applied to synthetic and municipal wastewater samples, and the results obtained from spiked recovery tests ranged between 79 and 113%. These results confirmed the applicability of the method for the selected sample matrices. The complex nature of the samples tested in this study affected the recovery of analytes. However, matrix matching calibration was employed to overcome the matrix effects and this improved the recovery results.

AB Stormwater retention ponds commonly receive some wastewater through misconnections, sewer leaks, and sewer overloads, all of which leads to unintended loads of organic micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals. This study explores the role of pond sediment in removing pharmaceuticals (naproxen, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, furosemide, and fenofibrate). It quantifies their sorption potential to the sediments and how it depends on pH. Then it addresses the degradability of the pharmaceuticals in microcosms holding sediment beds and pond water. The sediment-water partitioning coefficient of fenofibrate varied little with pH and was the highest (average log Kd: 4.42 L kg(-1)). Sulfamethoxazole had the lowest (average log Kd: 0.80 L kg(-1)), varying unsystematically with pH. The coefficients of naproxen, furosemide and carbamazepine were in between. The degradation by the sediments was most pronounced for sulfamethoxazole, followed by naproxen, fenofibrate, furosemide, and carbamazepine. The first three were all removed from the water phase with half-life of 2-8 days. Over the 38 days the experiment lasted, they were all degraded to near completion. The latter two were more resistant, with half-lives between 1 and 2 months. Overall, the study indicated that stormwater retention ponds have the potential to remove some but not all pharmaceuticals contained in wastewater contributions.

AB Wastewater-derived contaminants (WWDCs) occur in surface water due to inadequate wastewater treatment and subsequently challenge the capabilities of drinking water treatment. Fundamental chemical properties must be understood to reduce the occurrence of known WWDCs and to better anticipate future chemical contaminants of concern to water supplies. To date, examination of the fundamental properties of WWDCs in surface water appears to be completely lacking or inappropriately applied. In this research, the hydrophobicity-ionogenicity profiles of WWDCs reported to occur in surface water were investigated, concentrating primarily on pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), steroids, and hormones. Because most water treatment is conducted between pH 7 and 8 and because D-OW, the pH-dependent n-octanol-water distribution ratio embodies simultaneously the concepts of hydrophobicity and ionogenicity, D-OW at pH 7 - 8 is presented as an appropriate physicochemical parameter for understanding and regulating water treatment. Although the pH-dependent chemical character of hydrophobicity is not new science, this concept is insufficiently appreciated by scientists, engineers, and practitioners currently engaged in chemical assessment. The extremely hydrophilic character of many WWDCs at pH 7 - 8, indicated by D-OW (the combination of K-OW and pK(a)) not by K-OW of the neutral chemical, is proposed as an indicator of occurrence in surface water.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of wood-derived biochar for the removal of 18 pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) from untreated municipal wastewater (WW). The WW samples were analyzed by an HPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS method. Two aliquots of WWs were incubated with biochar sorbent for 2 h and 7 d. The highest absolute removal of PCs was achieved for ibuprofen and caffeine (2.6 and 13.2 mg L-1 after 7 d, respectively). The highest removal efficiency after 2 h incubation was detected for erythromycin (72.0% +/- 12.7 %) while lower degree of removal was observed for other compounds with much higher initial concentrations. The results indicated that a 2 h sorption process on biochar may be insufficient and 7 d incubation is preferred for quantitative removal of xylazine, metoprolol, and azithromycin. However, the sorption of ketoprofen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, and simvastatin on biochar was more effective during the first 2 h than during the following 7 d. Regression analysis revealed a strong correlation (R-2 similar to 0.9) between the absolute amounts of the removed PCs and their initial concentrations. In this respect, the removal of the last traces of PCs from WW is expected to present technological challenges.

AB There are conflicting findings on the toxicity of effluent from wastewater treatment plants, and only limited possibilities for assessing the effect-based removal efficiency (EBRE) of different treatment techniques. We describe a metabolomics approach to detect perturbations in fatty acid catabolic pathways as a proxy for biological effects. Metabolites in three fatty acid pathways were analysed in a common damselfly larva (Coenagrion hastulatum) by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The larvae were exposed for one week to either conventionally treated effluent (activated sludge treatment), effluent additionally treated with ozone, or effluent additionally treated with biochar filtration, and results were compared with those from tap water control exposure. Five lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins (9,10,13-TriHOME, 9,12,13-TriHOME, 9-HODE, 9-HOTrE, and 13-HOTrE) decreased in response to conventionally treated effluent exposure. By using an additional treatment step, oxylipin levels were restored with exception of 9,10,13-TriHOME (ozonated effluent), and 9-HOTrE and 13-HOTrE (effluent filtered with biochar). Thus, exposure to wastewater effluent affected fatty acid metabolite levels in damselfly larvae, and a subset of the analysed metabolites may serve as indicators for biological effects in biota in response to effluent exposure. To that effect, our findings suggest a new metabolomics protocol for assessing EBRE.

AB One of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds commonly found in treated wastewater is lamotrigine (LTG). It has also been detected in soils and crops irrigated with treated wastewater. Here we focused on the ability of the white-rot edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus to remove and transform LTG in liquid cultures. At concentrations of environmental relevance (1 and 10 mu g L-1) LTG was almost completely removed from the culture medium within 20 days. To elucidate the mechanism of LTG removal and transformation, we applied a physiological-based approach using inhibitors and a competing agent. These experiments were conducted at a higher concentration for metabolites detection. Based on identification of sulfur-containing metabolites and LTG N2-oxide and the effect of specific inhibitors, cytochrome P450 oxidation is suggested as one of the reaction mechanisms leading to LTG transformation. The variety and number of transformation products (i.e., conjugates) found in the current study were larger than reported in mammals. Moreover, known conjugates with glucuronide, glutathione, or cysteine/glycine, were not found in our system. Since the majority of the identified transformation products were conjugates of LTG, this study highlights the persistence of LTG as an organic pollutant in ecosystems exposed to wastewater.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the mobility of naproxen, carbamazepine, and triclosan through a wastewater-irrigated agricultural soil. Transport experiments were carried out using undisturbed soil columns taken at 10 and 40 cm depths. The mobilization of the pollutants was evaluated using two hydrological regimes transient flow for superficial columns and steady-state conditions for the sub-superficial columns. Results demonstrated that preferential flows are present in the superficial soil, and transient flow conditions facilitate the movement of the pollutants through the soil. Conversely, displacement of the contaminants in the sub-superficial soil columns was slower than that observed in the superficial soil. Triclosan was not found in the leachates of the soil columns at the two depths, indicating the strong retention of the compound by the soils. Conversely, naproxen and carbamazepine were determined in leachates of the soil columns at both depths. Retardation in the transport of carbamazepine was higher than that observed for naproxen in the two tested soils. Naproxen and triclosan showed some degree of dissipation, while carbamazepine was recalcitrant. It was concluded that the natural depuration system studied is capable of retaining and removing the studied pollutants and thus the risk of groundwater pollution is minimized.

AB The objective of this study has been to develop technologies that can reduce the content of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and bacteria from hospital wastewater. The results from the laboratory-and pilot-scale testings showed that efficient removal of the vast majority of APIs could be achieved by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) followed by ozone, ozone + hydrogen peroxide or powdered activated carbon (PAC). Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was significantly less effective. MBR + PAC (450 mg/l) was the most efficient technology, while the most cost-efficient technology was MBR + ozone (156 mg O-3/l applied over 20 min). With MBR an efficient removal of Escherichia coli and enterococci was measured, and no antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected in the effluent. With MBR + ozone and MBR + PAC also the measured effluent concentrations of APIs (e.g. ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole) were below available predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for the marine environment without dilution. Iodinated contrast media were also reduced significantly (80-99% for iohexol, iopromide and ioversol and 40-99% for amidotrizoateacid). A full-scale MBR treatment plant with ozone at a hospital with 900 beds is estimated to require an investment cost of (sic)1.6 mill. and an operating cost of (sic)1/m(3) of treated water.

AB With the aim of obtaining adsorbent systems to be used for the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater, some hybrid ionic liquid gels (HILGs) were obtained from the combination of ionic liquid-based supramolecular gels and carbon materials, like graphite, graphene and graphene oxide (graphene OX). The properties of HILGs were investigated by determining their gel-sol transition temperature and rheological features. They were tested for the removal of PhACs belonging to different pharmaceutical classes, like antibiotics, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory. In particular, the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac sodium salt (DCF), ciprofloxacin (CPX) and nalidixic acid (NXA) alone or in combination was performed. Adsorption tests were carried out with the aim of identifying how different operational parameters, like the time of contact, the PhAC concentration, the volume of treated wastewater and the use under dynamic or static conditions, affect the removal efficiency of the soft materials investigated. Furthermore, the possibility to recycle and restore the sorbent systems for further reuse was also considered. Finally, the most efficient system was also tested in real apparatuses, like a dialysis membrane and columns. HILGs proved to be promising soft materials for addressing the target issue, revealing easy to handle sorbent systems with broad applicability in the field of environmental remediation.

AB Chitobiase is one of two enzymes responsible for cleaving the chitin polymers that form arthropod exoskeletons and has been found to be predictive of secondary production for marine and freshwater zooplankton. Since chitobiase is released into water during molting by aquatic arthropods, it is possible that ambient chitobiase activity may be a useful proxy of secondary production in aquatic systems. In the present study, surface water samples from the upper Tennessee River basin, USA, were collected and analyzed for chitobiase to determine how enzyme levels vary with season, water depth, and proximity to sewage treatment outfalls. Additionally, chitobiase activity was correlated with three pharmaceutical compounds to assess if changes in chitobiase activity were associated with contaminants derived from sewage treatment plants. Chitobiase activity was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in the fall relative to other seasons. Further, chitobiase activity displayed significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between surface and subsurface samples and was negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with pharmaceutical concentrations in summer samples. These results indicate the potential for chitobiase as an assessment tool in estimating secondary production and as an ecotoxicological indictor.

AB The source control of pharmaceuticals involves influencing the everyday consumption volume and compound choice. This paper evaluates how source control contributes to protecting the environmental health and decreasing the investment needs in urban wastewater infrastructure. Different levels of reduction in diclofenac consumption (as recommended by the European Medicines Agency) compensated by equivalent increases in naproxen consumption (a less environmentally harmful compound) are evaluated. The different loads of compounds are fed into a microcontaminant fate and transport model of the Llobregat river basin (Spain) to assess the investment needs in tertiary treatment to reach diclofenac and naproxen concentrations below environmental quality standards. The results show that, despite the implementation of source control measures, tertiary treatment upgrades are still required in every scenario evaluated. Even though source control of pharmaceuticals decreases the investment needs in urban wastewater infrastructure, apparent concentrations reductions (i.e. statistically significant differences relative to the reference situation) are only observed in drastic substitutions of diclofenac by naproxen (a reduction in the total diclofenac consumption by 73% and a corresponding increase in naproxen consumption). The results also show that Spain is on good track with regards to the substitution of diclofenac by naproxen (among the top 5 in Europe), and this paper shows how positive this substitution can be for the environment.

AB This study aimed to assess the removal efficiency of microcontaminants (namely: acetaminophen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim) spiked in water by solar-driven photo-Fenton using Fe:Ethylenediamine-N, N '-disuccinic acid (1:1), focusing especially on improving operating parameters. These parameters were first studied at lab scale (1-4 L): (i) Fe3+ concentration; (ii) liquid depth; (iii) water matrix (natural water and real municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent). The best conditions were then evaluated outdoors under natural radiation in a pilot-scale solar photoreactor (90 L) treating real municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent evaluated by HPLC/QqLIT-MS. Diclofenac was the most efficiently degraded at lab scale and it was shown that the light pathlength did not affect the degradation rate but deeper liquid enables more treatment capacity. Fe:EDDS at 1:1 and iron concentration at 0.054 mM was sufficient for MC removal efficiency up to 97 %. All microcontaminants (46 microcontaminants were detected) were efficiently removed in the pilot scale under the best conditions determined at lab scale. Therefore, a well-designed, simple, low-volume and lowcost lab-scale photoreactor and a selected mixture of microcontaminants at close to real concentrations would enable selection of the operating parameters of a large solar photo-Fenton application.

AB The presence and fate of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in wastewater have received growing attention due to their potential impacts on human health and the environment. In this study, the authors assessed the presence of CECs in the influent and effluent of the Sharjah wastewater treatment plant (SWWTP), a conventional activated sludge system, over a 1 year period. Sharjah is the capital city of the Emirate of Sharjah in the UAE. Characterisation of the CECs required development of elaborate analytical techniques for detection and quantification of CECs at the nanogram per litre level. A total of 57 CECs were detected and identified, of which ten pharmaceuticals, including seven antibiotics, an analgesic/antipyretic medicine, a b-blocker and an antipsychotic drug were quantified. The measured concentrations of the ten quantified pharmaceuticals were in the tens to hundreds of nanograms per litre, except for acetaminophen, which reached micrograms per litre levels. The quantified CECs in the effluent were 4-69% of their levels in the influent, indicating apparent removals in the range 31-97%. This study is the first one on the presence and removal of CECs in the SWWTP and contributes essential literature on the subject in Sharjah and the region.

AB The presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater treatment plant effluents is an issue of great concern due to the negative effects that these compounds may have on human health and ecosystems. The present study aims to assess the capacity of two aquatic plants (Lemna sp. and Spirogyra sp.), commonly found in polishing ponds, for removing six pharmaceutical compounds (diclofenac, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and propranolol), two EDCs (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and bisphenol A), and one stimulant (caffeine) under laboratory-scale conditions. Planted and unplanted reactors fed with secondary-treated wastewater or ultrapure water in both covered and uncovered conditions were studied. The highest removal efficiencies, which ranged from 31 to 100 %, were achieved in uncovered planted systems containing secondary-treated wastewater after 20 days of incubation. The results demonstrated that non-charged compounds with a log Kow between 2 and 4 were affected by the presence of vegetation, probably due to their plant uptake, whereas negatively charged compounds were not. This highlights that the presence of plants in polishing ponds plays an important role in the removal of pharmaceuticals and EDCs.

ID BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT; PHARMACEUTICALS
AB This research investigates the environmental behavior of two widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering statin drugs that are expected to be present at significant concentrations in wastewater influents, namely: atorvastatin and simvastatin. Batch biodegradation experiments suggest that both statins are well degraded during secondary treatment, and removal rates exhibit a substrate-enhancement model reflecting elements of both first-order behavior and cometabolism. Resulting biodegradation parameters are used in conjunction with literature sorption parameters to construct a mass-balance model of statin concentrations during conventional treatment. Model results exhibit excellent accuracy compared to measurements from a medium-sized WWTP in the Southeastern USA. Influent concentrations of 1.56 mu g L-1 and 1.23.mu g L-1 were measured for atorvastatin and simvastatin. Results also suggest that 85-90% of each drug is removed during conventional treatment, with sorption accounting for less than 10% of overall removal. Expected effluent concentrations are orders of magnitude less than previously reported ecotoxicity thresholds for both drugs. Overall, results suggest statin active ingredients do not pose a significant environmental threat. It is recommended that future work characterize the fate of statin metabolites and that the same mass-balance modeling approach be used to assess other highly-prescribed pharmaceutical drugs.

AB An analytical method was developed for determining macrolide antibiotics in treated wastewater effluents and in ambient water based on solid-phase extraction and LC/MS analysis as well as on LC/MS/MS for structural confirmation, In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) macrolides are only partly eliminated and can therefore reach the aquatic environment, In treated effluents from three WWTPs in Switzerland, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and erythromycin-H2O, the main degradation product of erythromycin, were found. The most abundant, clarithromycin, reflects the consumption pattern of macrolide antibiotics. Summer concentrations of clarithromycin varied between 57 and 330 ng/L in treated WWTP effluents. In the WWTP Kloten-Opfikon seasonal differences revealed a load two times higher in winter than in summer. The higher abundance of erythromycin-H2O in the effluent of WWTP Kloten-Opfikon can be explained by distinct consumption patterns due to the main international airport of Switzerland in the catchment area. In the Glatt River clarithromycin reached concentrations of up to 75 ng/L. Mass flux determinations in treated effluents and in river water in the Glatt Valley watershed showed that elimination of clarithromycin along the river stretch of 36 km is insignificant (<20%). Investigations in the Glatt River before and after the diversion of the largest WWTP revealed an observable decrease in clarithromycin loads.

AB In this study, the fate of several micropollutants (MPs) in wastewater due to coagulation using both fresh and recovered aluminum and iron coagulants was determined. 18 MPs from different groups such as antibiotics, food additives, and surfactants were selected and spiked into the primary influent collected from a local wastewater plant. The distribution of MPs in the recovered coagulant and treated effluent after coagulation was determined for both fresh and recycled coagulants. The distribution of MPs in wastewater and the removal during coagulation were compound specific; MPs with log K-ow < 2.5 were predominantly present in the effluent after coagulation, while MPs with log K-ow > 2.5 were sorbed on the coagulated sludge. The distribution ratio (K-d) of all the MPs (diclofenac, clarithromycin, etc.) with log K-ow > 2.5 was determined along with their extent of accumulation in sludge due to the recycling of coagulants. Compounds such as sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and sulfathiazole, showed low removal during coagulation. The tetracycline group of compounds showed possible chelation with iron and aluminum. Only <10% of the initially spiked MPs with log K-ow > 2.5 was being recycled with the recovered coagulant, thus alleviating the concern of accumulation of the MPs during recycle of the coagulants.

AB Submarine sewage outfalls (SSOs) are considered the main input source of contaminants of emerging concern continuously released in coastal areas, with the potential to cause adverse effects for aquatic organisms. This work presents the investigation of nine endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 26 pharmaceutically active chemicals (PhACs) in marine sediments within the vicinities of 7 SSOs along the Sao Paulo State Coast (Brazil). Method optimization for the multi-residue determination by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS using QuEChERS extraction/clean-up are discussed. Results demonstrate the occurrence of EDCs in concentrations ranging from less than method quantification limits (MQL) to 72.5 ng g(-1) in sediments. All PhACs were < MQLs. Nonylphenol was the most ubiquitous compound and the diversity of EDCs increased with an increase in populations serviced by SSOs. The predicted environmental risk assessment considering measured environmental concentrations and ecotoxicity endpoints from literature suggest a high-risk potential in some of the investigated SSOs.

AB The capability of ozone to reduce the hazardous impact of environmentally persistent antibiotic tiamulin in term of toxicity reduction and enhancement of biodegradability was investigated. Different ozone doses were applied but ozonation was not effective enough to increase the biodegradability of tiamulin in the aqueous phase. The opposite effect was observed in anaerobic digestion experiments, where ozonation as a pretreatment step of antibiotic-contaminated sludge detoxify tiamulin and improves biogas production for 75%. As confirmed by H-1 NMR and HPLC-HRMS analyses, the tiamulin molecule completely reacts with ozone at low ozone/COD molar ratio of 0.03, primarily attacking the vinyl double bond with further oxidation of sulfur and nitrogen atom, and gradual decomposition of tiamulin skeleton.

AB A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was fed a synthetic wastewater containing glucose to study the effects of the antimicrobial tylosin on treatment performance. Measurements of methane, volatile fatty acids, and COD concentrations suggested that the addition of 1.67 mg/L and 167 mg/l of tylosin to the synthetic wastewater inhibited propionate oxidizing syntrophic bacteria and aceticlastic methanogens. The latter is presumed to be an indirect effect. A modified version of the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) with extensions for microbial storage and hydrolysis of reserve carbohydrates, and tylosin liquid-solid mass transfer and inhibition adequately described the dynamic profiles observed in the ASBR.

AB Scientists are on the lookout for a practical model that can serve as a standard for sorting out, identifying, and characterizing microplastics which are common occurrences in water sources and wastewaters. The microbeads (MBs) used in cosmetics and discharged into the sewer systems after use cause substantial microplastics pollution in the receiving waters. Today, the use of plastic microbeads in cosmetics is banned. The existing use cases are to be discontinued within a few years. Yet, there are no restrictions regarding the use of microbeads in a number of industries, cleaning products, pharmaceuticals and medical practices. In this context, the determination and classification of MBs which had so far been discharged to water sources and which continue to be discharged, represent crucial problems. In this work, we examined a new approach for the classification of MBs based on microscopic images. For classification purposes, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -a Deep Learning algorithm- was employed, whereas GoogLeNet architecture served as the model. The network is built from scratch, and trained then after tested on a total of 42928 images containing MBs in 5 distinct cleansers. The study performed with the CNN which achieved a classification performance of 89% for MBs in wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewaters contain a large number of chemical pollutants such as disinfectants, detergents, and drug residues. A part of these pollutants is not eliminated by traditional urban waste water treatment plants, leading to a major risk for the aquatic ecosystems receiving these effluents. After having formulated a specific methodology in order to assessment ecotoxicological risk for such a situation, we applied it to the project to build a new hospital shared by several towns in the French Alps. This methodology is based on the ecotoxicological characterisation of the hospital wastewater using a battery of three chronic bioassays (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Heterocypris incongruens and Brachionus calyciflorus) and of genotoxicity tests (Ames fluctuation assay on Salmonella typhimurium, and a Fpg-modified comet assay on the trout liver cell line RTL-W1). The formulated methodology highlights a moderate risk of the hospital wastewater for the organisms of the water column of the river concerned. Nevertheless, this discharge contributes significantly to the global ecotoxicological risk when taking into account all the releases of the watershed into the river. This leads to recommending the implementation of a specific treatment system in the urban WWTP, or upstream to it, in view to protecting the aquatic organisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The accumulation of high-molecular-weight organic compounds is a common phenomenon in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). It is currently not known to what extent accumulation occurs in full-scale plants because relevant tests were mostly performed in experimental plants. To overcome the lack of practical experience, a measurement campaign was carried out including four municipal wastewater treatment plants and two pilot plants [one MBR and one conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)]. The results clearly showed that accumulation depends on sludge retention time (SRT), temperature, sludge volume index (SVI), and the fraction of volatile suspended solids (VSS). As a result of biological processes, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) accumulation may increase for a limited period of time and amounts 10-120 mg/(PE . d). The introduction of sludge from a municipal MBR into the system of conventional activated sludge plants (CAS) for external sludge handling does not affect the treatment efficacy of the latter. On the other hand, it can be assumed that accumulated critical substances (e. g., pharmaceuticals) in an MBR may be released during external sludge processing and reach the receiving water.

AB This study evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging characteristics of wastewater from five membrane bioreactor (MBR) and five activated sludge (AS) systems. The average values of the characteristics of both wastewater types was found to be significantly different at a 90% confidence interval in terms UV absorbance at 254 nm, alkalinity, and biopolymer concentration. Effluent organic matter (EfOM), with an average k(OH,EfOM) of (2.75 +/- 1.04) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), was identified as the primary hydroxyl scavenger contributing to >70% of the background scavenging in all cases, except when nitrite exceeded 0.3 mg NO2--N/L. The average scavenging capacity, EfOM scavenging capacity, and the EfOM reaction rate constant of the AS wastewaters exceeded that of the MBR. However, due to the small sample size (n = 5) and considerable variability in scavenging characteristics among the MBR wastewaters, the difference in EfOM reactivity between the two wastewaters was not statistically significant at a 90% confidence interval. Nevertheless, these preliminary findings suggest the possibility that MBR wastewaters may be more amenable to treatment by advanced oxidation. A plausible explanation is that MBRs were observed to reject biopolymers, and a strong correlation was observed between EfOM scavenging capacity and biopolymer concentration.

AB Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), such as the Fenton, photo-Fenton and H2O2/UV processes, have been investigated for the treatment of cosmetic wastewaters that were previously coagulated by FeCl3. The Photo-Fenton process at pH 3.0 with 1000/100 mg L-1 H2O2/Fe2+ was the most effective (74.0% Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal). The Fenton process with 1200/500 mg L-1 H2O2/Fe2+ achieved a COD removal of 72.0%, and the H2O2/UV process achieved a COD removal of 47.0%. Spreading the H2O2 doses over time to obtain optimal conditions did not improve COD removal. The kinetics of the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes may be described by the following equation: d[COD]/dt D = -a[COD] t(m) (t represents time and a and m are constants). The rate of COD removal by the H2O2/UV process may be described by a second-order reaction equation. Head Space, Solid-Phase MicroExtraction, Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) were used to identify 48 substances in precoagulated wastewater. Among these substances, 26 were fragrances. Under optimal AOP conditions, over 99% of the identified substances were removed in 120 min.

AB This study was carried out to increase the treatment efficiency through the improvement of the conventional biological process, and to propose the optimal treatment direction. The optimal treatment conditions were derived based on the results of the spike damage tests in each single process. The removal efficiency of micropharmaceuticals was further increased when an ozone treatment process was added to the biological process compared to the single process. The soil and activated carbon adsorption process was introduced in the post-treatment to remove the micropharmaceutical residues, and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceduticals in the final effluent was more than 85% in spike damage experiment. In particular, the continuous process of biological treatment-ozone-adsorption could ensure the stable treatment of micropharmaceuticals, which had not been efficiently removed in the single process, as it showed more than 80% removal efficiency. Therefore, it is expected that the addition of the ozone oxidation and activated carbon adsorption process to the existing sewage treatment facilities can contribute to the efficient removal of micropharmaceuticals.

AB Advanced wastewater treatment with granular activated carbon (GAC) is a promising option to reduce emissions of organic micropollutants (OMP) into the aquatic environment. Frequent back-washes of the GAC filters are required due to high particle concentration in the treated wastewater but lead to stratification. Differences in adsorption capacities of individual strata are not known. The present study aimed at investigating physical and chemical differences at different filter depths of a stratified GAC filter. Two different commercial products were stratified during repeated filter bed expansions and sectioned into vertical fractions. Bulk densities, grain size distributions and ash contents of the individual fractions differed significantly. Adsorption tests with pulverized GAC from different levels showed great vertical differences in adsorption properties. OMP removals determined in the upper part of a GAC filter therefore cannot be extrapolated downwards. Both physical and chemical vertical heterogeneities with regard to adsorption capacities and residence times at different filter depths should be considered in the filter design, in the monitoring of a GAC filter, and in the interpretation of the GAC filter performance. Good correlations between abatements of UV light absorption and OMP removals were found for the virgin GAC throughout the non-uniform filter.

AB The performance and effectiveness of sonophotolytic process, aerobic activated sludge (AS) process, and their combination in reduction of total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) from a synthetic pharmaceutical wastewater (SPWW) are evaluated. Batch mode experiments are performed to obtain optimal experimental operating conditions of the sonophotolytic process. An ultrasonic power of 140 W, initial pH solution of 2, and air flow rate of 3 L min(-1) are found to be optimal operating conditions. The initial optimum molar ratio of H2O2/TOC was found to be 13.77 for the sonophotolytic process operated in batch mode. In continuous mode, a 90% TOC reduction was obtained in the sonophotolytic process after 180 min retention time, whereas only 67% in an aerobic AS process for retention time of 48 h. However, combined sonophotolytic and aerobic AS processes improved the biodegradability of the SPWW with 98% TOC and 99% COD removal while reducing the retention time in sonophotoreactor and aerobic AS bioreactor to 120 min and 24 h, respectively. Besides, the consumption of H2O2 was reduced significantly in the combined processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Upgrades of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and full-scale application of additional advanced oxidation processes have been proven to be effective in reducing the nutrient emissions to the environment; however, the impacts of WWTP upgrades on the receiving waters with regard to the occurrence and ecological risks of pharmaceuticals are still unclear. In this study, 27 pharmaceuticals with diverse physicochemical properties were monitored in four rivers in Beijing, each of which was heavily impacted by a large-scale WWTP. Three-year sampling campaigns were conducted, covering the periods before and after the WWTP upgrades. The results show that the newly added combined treatment processes (e.g., biological filter, ultrafiltration, ozonation, and NaClO disinfection) reduced the total pharmaceutical concentrations in the effluents by 45-74%. The composition profiles reveal that the upgrades of two studied WWTPs resulted in a significant reduction of pharmaceutical concentrations in the receiving rivers, while little impacts were observed for the other rivers. The risk assessment shows that the acute toxic pressures in the studied rivers were generally low and the WWTP upgrades were conducive to reduce the risks for most of pharmaceuticals. However, erythromycin and ofloxacin still posed high risk, indicating the potential adverse effect of pharmaceuticals on aquatic environment.

AB Aeration accounts for the largest energy demand in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment. Emerging aeration control strategies for energy conservation have significantly reduced operational bulk liquid dissolved oxygen (DO) from above 2 mg/L to at or below 0.5 mg/L. As we move toward low DO treatment processes, there is a need to understand how low DO impacts the kinetics of micropollutant biotransformation. The objective of this study was to characterize the impact of DO concentration on pharmaceutical biotransformation rates via two approaches: (1) Determine oxygen half saturation constants that describe the community-wide impact of DO on biotransformation rates. (2) Evaluate shifts in the microbial community 16S rRNA pool due to DO concentration. Batch experiments were performed at several DO concentrations using biomass from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Results reveal that substantial reductions in bulk liquid DO concentrations to 0.5 mg-O-2/L are possible without compromising pharmaceutical biotransformation rates. Sequencing of cDNA generated from community rRNA revealed that diverse, low abundance community members may play important roles in pharmaceutical transformation. The results of this work advance our ability to predict and model the impact of DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during wastewater treatment and identify taxonomic groups associated with those biotransformations.

AB The activated sludge process in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) relies on the activity of microbes to reduce the organic and inorganic matter and produce effluent that is safe to discharge into receiving waters. This research examined the effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen and the antibiotic tetracycline on the relative abundance and composition of eukaryotes and bacteria in the microbial population present in activated sludge from a WWTP. The current investigation was designed to observe the impact of these contaminants, at low (environmentally relevant concentrations) as well as high concentrations of the drugs. Using 16S and 18S rRNA gene primer sets and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the abundance of each population was monitored as well as the relative ratio of the two populations under the various conditions. It was found that current environmentally relevant concentrations of ibuprofen (100 ng/mL) stimulated eukaryotic growth but higher concentrations (2,000 ng/mL, 100,000 ng/mL) reduced their numbers significantly especially in the presence of tetracycline. Finally using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, some of the more abundant eukaryotes were identified and it was noted that high ibuprofen and tetracycline concentrations favoured the abundance of some genera.

AB Six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were investigated to evaluate the occurrence and removal of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), NDMA formation potential (FP) and four specific NDMA precursors, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylformamide (DMFA) and dimethylaminobenzene (DMAB). DMA and tertiary amines with DMA functional group commonly existed in municipal wastewater. Chemically enhanced primary process (CEPP) had no effect on removal of either NDMA or NDMA FP. In WWTPs with secondary treatment processes, considerable variability was observed in the removal of NDMA (19%-85%) and NDMA FP (16%-76%), moreover, there was no definite relationship between the removal of NDMA and NDMA FP. DMA was well removed in all the six surveyed WWTPs; its removal efficiency was greater than 97%. For the removal of tertiary amines, biologic treatment processes with nitrification and denitrification had better removal efficiency than conventional activated sludge process. The best removal efficiencies for TMA, DMFA and DMAB were 95%, 68% and 72%, respectively. CEPP could remove 73% of TMA, 23% of DMFA and 36% of DMAB. After UV disinfection, only 17% of NDMA was removed due to low dosage of UV was applied in WWTP. Although chlorination could reduce NDMA precursors, NDMA concentration was actually increased after chlorination.

AB Source control or elimination of precursors of NDMA and other nitrosamines in wastewater requires information on their physicochemical properties, which is still limited. Thus we developed a multistep fractionation method based on a combination of consecutive filtration steps to <1 mu m, <0.2 mu m urn, and <2.5 kDa followed by solid-phase extraction on a C18 column and validated it using model NDMA precursors covering a wide polarity range. The membrane filtration to <2.5 kDa was suitable to separate a low-molecular weight precursor fraction but partially removed hydrophobic compounds by sorption. Fractionation on a C18 column allowed distinguishing highly polar precursors (such as dimethylamine) from less polar ones (such as ranitidine or other pharmaceuticals). Application of the fractionation procedure together with the formation potential test revealed that in the influent of one studied wastewater treatment plant about 50% of all precursors were associated with colloids or macromolecules, suggesting that these fractions comprise sorbed hydrophobic precursors. During activated sludge treatment small polar and charged NDMA and other nitrosamines' precursors were removed to about 80%. In contrast, less polar precursors were more recalcitrant. In advanced treatment steps, only small fractions of the precursors were removed by the prechlorination/ultrafiltration step, while reverse osmosis removed >98% of all precursors.

AB In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distributions and risks of 15 non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface water collected from Qinzhou Bay, China during the summer and winter of 2017. Our results showed that 14 out of the 15 target PPCPs were detected, and they had higher concentrations in the winter than the summer, except for N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide and indomethacin. Furthermore, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide and caffeine respectively were the dominant contaminants in the summer and winter, with their highest concentrations up to 33.7 ng/L and 26.8 ng/L. Generally, concentrations of PPCPs were higher in the inner bay than outer bays, with untreated sewage and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) as main pollution sources. The results of the risk assessment indicate that diclofenac may pose risks to aquatic organisms. Overall, our results provided occurrence and important insights into the risk management of PPCPs in Qinzhou Bay.

AB The European Commission's draft regulation for minimum requirements for water reuse in agriculture addresses microbial and basic water quality parameters but does not consider the potential impacts of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) on human and environmental health. Because insufficient data prevents the quantitative characterisation of risks posed by CECs in treated wastewater (TWW), this paper presents a framework, which combines data and expert judgement to assess likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of impact. An increasing relative scale is applied where numeric values are pre-defined to represent comparative levels of importance. Subsequently, an overall assessment of the level of risk is characterised by multiplying together allocated scores, to obtain a single discrete overall score per CEC. Guidelines to support implementation of the framework as far as soil (the initial receiving compartment and pathway to further protected targets) are developed and applied. The approach is demonstrated through its application to clarithromycin, where results indicate that - under the considered scenario there is limited possibility of its occurrence in soil in a bioavailable form. The role of a qualitative risk assessment approach is considered and the opportunity for its outputs to inform future research agendas described.

AB This work presents a case study of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in Biscay (Spain), in which the removal of high-occurrence contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) was studied. The existing biological treatment in the WWTP was complemented with a continuous ultrafiltration (c-UF) pilot plant, as a tertiary treatment. Thus, the effect on CEC removal of both treatments could be analyzed globally and after each operation. A total of 39 CEC were monitored, including pharmaceutical products, industrial additives, food additives, herbicides and personal care products. For evaluation of the efficiencies, the removal rates of the biological and of the c-UF treatments, including their variability over a day and a week in relation to the ammonium content, were examined in the influent of the WWTP. In the biological treatment, a wide range of different removal rates was obtained due to the different CEC's biodegradability and concentration. In UF, lower, but more constant removal rates, were achieved. In addition, the reduction of the general toxicity by the UF treatment in terms of the Microtox((R)) toxicity assay was also evaluated. After UF, all of the samples yielded values of TU50 lower than 1, confirming this result the UF effectiveness for toxicity removal.

AB Triclocarban (TCC) is an antibacterial agent found in pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). It is potentially bioaccumulative and an endocrine disruptor, being classified as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC). In normal uses, approximately 96% of the used TCC can be washed down the drain going into the sewer system and eventually enter in the aquatic environment. UV photolysis can be used to photodegrade TCC and ecotoxicity assays could indicate the photodegradation efficiency, since the enormous structural diversity of photoproducts and their low concentrations do not always allow to identify and quantify them. In this work, the TCC was efficiently degraded by UVC direct photolysis and the ecotoxicity of the UV-treated mixtures was investigated. Bioassays indicates that Daphnia similis (48 h EC50 = 0.044 mu M) was more sensitive to TCC than Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (72 h IC50 = 1.01 mu M). TCC and its photoproducts caused significant effects on Eisenia andrei biochemical responses (catalase and glutathione-S-transferase); 48 h was a critical exposure time, since GST reached the highest activity values.

AB A screening survey of 81 pharmaceuticals was carried out at a wastewater facility and in a detrital aquifer (Barcelona, Spain), where treated wastewater (TWW) was injected through wells to build up a hydraulic barrier against seawater intrusion. The monitored data correspond to the 2007-2010 period. The TWW was tertiary treated with additional treatment consisting of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and UV disinfection. During the monitoring period groundwater monitoring was carried out in wells located within a 1-km radius distance from the injection wells. During monitoring period 20 new pharmaceuticals were detected in the aquifer media and 11 compounds were found with concentration above 0.1 mu g l(-1) (selected threshold) in both TWW and wells. After 1 year of TWW injection change of redox conditions, a decrease of Cl- concentration and presence of 11 pharmaceuticals (4-AAA, 4-FAA, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diazepam, diclofenac, hydrochlorothiazide, mepivacaine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine and sulfapyridine) was observed in the monitoring wells. After the studied period the sodium-chloride aquifer water type evolved to a bicarbonate-sulphate facies. Decrease of the pharmaceuticals concentration in groundwater appears to be driven by the dilution process and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer media, with the attenuation or degradation process much less important.

AB The fate of organic micropollutans (MPs) in a membrane system based on microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis/nanofiltration (RO/NF) has been investigated for the case of wastewater reuse. Both an operating full-scale water reuse plant and a pilot plant were employed, with 22 individual organic compounds at their ambient concentrations studied for the former and the latter employing two target compounds over a range of feed concentrations. Results revealed removal efficiencies higher than 75% for most compounds in the full-scale plant, though mass flow studies on all streams revealed a significant imbalance of material for some compounds. Rejection efficiencies measured for candidate commercial NF and RO membranes tested at pilot scale challenged with a pharmaceutically active compound (ibuprofen, IBU) and an endocrine-disrupting chemical (nonylphenol, NP) exceeded 99%. Permeate concentrations were 0.005-0.14g/L for IBU and below the limit of detection for NP. A mass balance of the MPs for the full-scale plant across the MF and RO stages revealed a significant imbalance associated with the challenge of accurate determination of low concentrations. Differences in pilot plant and full-scale data were otherwise attributed to the impact of membrane ageing (and specifically hydrolysis) on RO rejection of the MPs examined.

AB The degradation of a pharmaceutical mixture (gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide and naproxen) by TiO2/UV-A in different aqueous matrices was evaluated. The matrix components affected the operational conditions, rate constants, and removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals, as well as toxicity. For sewage treatment plant effluent, a TiO2 concentration three-fold higher (450 mg L-1) and an irradiation time 1.5-3 times longer were required to reach the same efficiency of degradation as the pharmaceuticals in deionized water and surface water matrices. An improvement in the rate constants and the removal efficiency of the pharmaceuticals was achieved by adding 6 mg L-1 of H2O2 and 150 mg L-1 of TiO2 in deionized water and surface water, but not in the sewage treatment plant effluent, due to the coupling of 450 mg L-1 of TiO2 and 50-200 mg L-1 of H2O2. Overall, TiO2/UV-A efficiently degraded all compounds, but an additional step is needed for the removal of residual toxicity.

AB In this work, the primary focus is given on a mixture of 27 micropollutants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and others) and its removal from aqueous solution by phytoremediation. Phytoremediation belongs to technologies, which are contributing on removal of micropollutants from wastewater in constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands can be used as an additional step for elimination of micropollutants from municipal medium-sized wastewater treatment plants. To our knowledge, such a broad variety of micropollutants was never targeted for removal by phytoremediation before. In this work, we carry out experiments with 3 emergent macrophytes: Phragmites australis, Iris pseudacorus and Lythrum salicaria in hydroponic conditions. The selected plants are exposed to mixture of micropollutants in concentrations 1-14 mg/l for a time period of 30 days. The highest affinity for phytoremediation is detected at groups of fluorosurfactants (removal rate up to 30%), beta-blockers (removal rate up to 50%) and antibiotics (removal rate up to 90%). The leading capability for micropollutant uptake is detected at Lythrum salicaria, where 25 out of 27 compounds are removed with more than 20% efficiency. The results demonstrate well usefulness of this technology e.g. in an additional treatment step, because the mentioned groups of micropollutants are removed with comparable or even higher effectivity, than it is in case of conventional wastewater treatment plants.

AB The endocrine disrupting micropollutant tamoxifen can induce several effects on aquatic organisms. It is introduced into the environment mainly by wastewater treatment plant effluents. To reduce the discharge of micropollutants into surface waters, ozonation can be used as additional wastewater treatment option. For only few transformation products (TPs) formed by ozonation ecotoxicological data are available. To enable an initial estimation of ecotoxicological potentials of the TPs formed after the ozonation of tamoxifen, acute toxicity (immobilization) to Daphnia magna and green algae growth inhibition using Desmodesmus subspicatus were determined for several ozone doses spiked at pH 3 and pH 7. The initial immobilization of D. magna by tamoxifen was not further observed after ozonation. In contrast, the green algae growth inhibition increased due to ozonation of tamoxifen. Overall, five transformation products were observed. For three TPs, positive correlations of green algae growth inhibition and peak area were determined, whereas two TPs do not induce the residual effects. Based on our observations, TP 270 can be assumed as most potent of the formed TPs concerning green algae growth inhibition. Since the effect is not induced by formed N-oxides, green algae growth inhibition could be reduced by sufficient ozone exposure during wastewater treatment.

AB Systematic sampling and analysis of wastewater samples are increasingly adopted for estimating drug consumption in communities. An understanding of the in sewer transportation and transformation of illicit drug biomarkers is critical for reducing the uncertainty of this evidence-based estimation method. In this study, biomarkers stability was investigated in lab-scale sewer reactors with typical sewer conditions. Kinetic models using the Bayesian statistics method were developed to simulate biomarkers transformation in reactors. Furthermore, a field-scale study was conducted in a real pressure sewer pipe with the systematical spiking and sampling of biomarkers and flow tracers. In-sewer degradation was observed for some spiked biomarkers over typical hydraulic retention time (i.e., a few hours). Results indicated that sewer biofilms prominently influenced biomarker stability with the retention time in wastewater. The fits between the measured and the simulated biomarkers transformation demonstrated that the lab-based model could be extended to estimate the changes of biomarkers in real sewers. Results also suggested that the variabilities of biotransformation and analytical accuracy are the two major contributors to the overall estimation uncertainty. Built upon many previous lab-scale studies, this study is one critical step forward in realizing wastewater based epidemiology by extending biomarker stability investigations from laboratory reactors to real sewers.

AB Surface water samples constantly receive a vast mixture of micropollutants mainly originating from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). High-throughput live cell arrays provide a promising method for the characterization of the effects of chemicals and the associated molecular mechanisms. In the present study, this test system was evaluated for the first time for the characterization of a set of typical surface water extracts receiving effluent from WWTPs. The extracts containing complex mixtures of micropollutants were analyzed for the expression of 90 stress responsive genes in the Escherichia coli reporter gene assay. The most affected pathways and the genes most sensitive to surface water samples suggested prominent stress-responsive pathways for wastewater-impacted surface water, such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, and drug resistance. Samples strongly affecting particular pathways were identified by statistical analysis of gene expression. Transcription data were correlated with contamination data from chemical screening and percentages of wastewater in the samples. Samples with particular effects and outstanding chemical composition were analyzed. For these samples, hypotheses on the alteration of the transcription of genes involved in drug resistance and DNA repair attributable to the presence of pharmaceuticals were drawn.

AB Wastewater effluents contain a multitude of organic contaminants and transformation products, which cannot be captured by target analysis alone. High accuracy, high resolution mass spectrometric data were explored with novel untargeted data processing approaches (enviMass, nontarget, and RMassBank) to complement an extensive target analysis in initial "all in one" measurements. On average 1.2% of the detected peaks from 10 Swiss wastewater treatment plant samples were assigned to target compounds, with 376 reference standards available. Corrosion inhibitors, artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals exhibited the highest concentrations. After blank and noise subtraction, 70% of the peaks remained and were grouped into components; 20% of these components had adduct and/or isotope information available. An intensity-based prioritization revealed that only 4 targets were among the top 30 most intense peaks (negative mode), while 15 of these peaks contained sulfur. Of the 26 nontarget peaks, 7 were tentatively identified via suspect screening for sulfur-containing surfactants and one peak was identified and confirmed as 1,3-benzothiazole-2-sulfonate, an oxidation product of a vulcanization accelerator. High accuracy, high resolution data combined with tailor-made nontarget processing methods (all available online) provided vital information for the identification of a wider range of heteroatom-containing compounds in the environment.

AB This study investigated the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, emphasizing triiodinated benzene derivatives used as X-ray contrast media, in domestic effluents and their fate during subsequent groundwater recharge. Organic iodine measurements were used as a surrogate for triiodinated benzene derivatives. Seven wastewater treatment facilities in Texas, Arizona and California were studied and organic iodine concentrations at these facilities varied between 5 and 40 mug iodine/L. The highest concentrations were observed on weekdays reflecting the common practice of employing X-ray examinations between Monday and Friday. Organic iodine compounds in secondary treated effluents were not removed by advanced wastewater treatment using ozone. However, organic iodine was efficiently removed by reverse osmosis membrane treatment. Based on laboratory biodegradation experiments and field studies negligible removal occurred under aerobic redox conditions while anoxic conditions led to partial removal of organic iodine. However, a concentration range of 8-15 mug iodine/L was observed in groundwater recharge systems after travel times of 8 to 10 years. Beside appropriate redox conditions, bioavailable organic carbon seems to be a key factor for organic iodine biodegradation in the environment. No environmental risk is expected from the parent compounds of triiodinated contrast media, however, toxicological effects associated with the metabolites are unknown.

AB Many water and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are fitted with a UV system that provides post treatment disinfection before the water is released to receiving water. This paper presents a study on expected removal for the pharmaceutical venlafaxine (VEN) in a typical UV unit at a municipal WWTP with analysis of removal rates of an advanced oxidation process using UV irradiation with injection of H2O2. The study is supported by bench scale degradation experiments on VEN. Results demonstrated that UV can completely degrade VEN, but the addition of H2O2 increased pseudo first order rate constant by up to 2.5 times. Extrapolations of the lab data indicated that removal rates of VEN at the UV disinfection unit of a typical municipal WWTP are approximately 0.4% at standard operating conditions. With the addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2, degradation of VEN can be increased by ten times over existing UV treatment. By studying the impact of adjusting parameters such as UV intensity, UV dosage, and H2O2 dosage, a framework is set to allow researchers and engineers to move forward with developing UV/H2O2 systems that meet their future design needs for pharmaceutical removal.

AB Although pharmaceuticals are generally found at very low levels in aquatic environments, concern about their potential risks to humans and aquatic species has been raised because they are designed to be biologically active. To resolve this concern, we must know whether the biological activity of pharmaceuticals can be detected in waters. Nearly half of all marketed pharmaceuticals act by binding to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, we measured the physiological activity of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. We applied the in vitro transforming growth factor-a (TGFa) shedding assay, which accurately and sensitively detect GPCR activation, to investigate the agonistic/antagonistic activities of wastewater extracts against receptors for angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2, D4), adrenergic family members (alpha 1B, alpha 2A, beta 1, beta 3), acetylcholine (M1, M3), cannabinoid (CB1), vasopressin (V1A, V2), histamine (H1, H2, H3), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A, 5-HT2C), prostanoid (EP3), and leukotriene (BLT1). As a result, antagonistic activity against AT1, D2, alpha 1B, beta 1, M1, M3, H1, and V2 receptors was detected at up to several mu g/L for the first time. Agonistic activity against alpha 2A receptor was also detected. The TGFa shedding assay is useful for measuring the physiological activity of GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.

AB Tamoxifen and 5-fluorouracil are widely used in cancer therapy. They are highly toxic (teratogenic, mutagenic, etc.), as are most of the anticancer drugs. Two methods were set up to analyse these drugs in wastewaters to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination by cytostatic agents. Liquid-liquid extraction followed by purification on OASIS (R) MCX cartridge and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS) was used for the analysis of tamoxifen. 5-Fluorouracil was extracted with an ENV+(Isolute) cartridge (solid-phase extraction), derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) and detected by GC-MS. Both methods showed good recoveries (> 70%), repeatability (RSD < 10%) and limits of detection (LOD 6-15 ng/L). Wastewaters from a residential area, a hospital, and sewage-treatment plants (STPs) were analysed using the analytical methods developed in this study. Tamoxifen was detected in wastewaters of the hospital, residential area, and influent of STPs, but not in treated wastewaters. 5-Fluorouracil in all wastewaters was below the LOD of the analytical method.

AB Recently, several new types of organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been found in sewage or surface waters. Some of the polar pharmaceuticals have also been detected in samples of ground and drinking water, especially when water from induced recharge is used for drinking water production. The fate and the transport of eight drug residues during groundwater recharge (GWR) of contaminated surface water was investigated at an artificial groundwater replenishment plant in Berlin, Germany. After a recharge distance of only a few meters, bezafibrate, a blood lipid regulator, and indomethacin, an analgesic, were removed below their detection limits. Clofibric acid, a metabolite of blood lipid lowering agents, and the analgesic drugs diclofenac and propyphenazone were also attenuated during GWR. However, they were still detectable in the receiving water supply wells at low concentration levels (<= 40 ng L-1). The anti-epileptic drugs carbamazepine and primidone and the drug metabolite AMDOPH (1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-dimethyl-oxamoyl-2-phenylhydrazide) were not significantly affected by GWR occurring in the water supply wells at mean individual concentrations between 100 and 1570 ng L-1.

AB The treatment technologies discussed in this article explore the removal of compounds of emerging concern (CECs). There are no regulations currently restricting CECs, but with the recent media attention and increasing public awareness of the issue, as well as improving technology to detect these substances, regulations may be on the horizon. The future regulatory scenarios to address these CECs will be of most interest utility managers.
   There are several source control alternatives as well as treatment technologies that can help to reduce CEC concentrations in drinking water. This article summarizes the effects, removal, and regulatory responses to CECs and outlines where more research is needed. Water utilities are encouraged to begin planning for long-term upgrades and policies to address CECs. In addition, the authors ecourage cooperation between water and wastewater utilities.-LH

To date, most of the research has focused on chemical classes such as chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants, pesticides, or degradation products of high-use industrial surfactants. However little is Known about the environmental impact of another important class of chemicals: hormonally active pharmaceutical products. This deficit of information is surprising, given the biological potencies of these widely used substances and their potential to enter the environment through sewage treatment effluents and runoff from agricultural applications. Estrogenic pharmaceutical products are used extensively in human estrogen-replacement therapy and oral contraceptive formulations. Estrogenic substances are also used as growth enhancement products in veterinary medicine. This report describes the potencies, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic pathways of such estrogenic products. The amounts of pharmaceutical-derived estrogens that reach the environment from doses and usage are estimated. Factors that affect environmental concentrations including metabolism and biodegradation are also considered. Finally, rue present both chemical and analytical data, as well as bioassay evidence, that suggest that biologically active concentrations of estrogenic compounds are being released into the aquatic environment.

AB Recent research has demonstrated the potential of using filamentous fungi to form pellets with microalgae (biopellets), in order to facilitate harvesting of microalgae from water following algae-based treatment of wastewater. In parallel, there is a need to develop techniques for removing organic pollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals from wastewater. In experiments using the microalga Chlorella vulgaris, the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger and biopellets composed of these microorganisms, this study investigated whether fungal-assisted algal harvesting can also remove pesticides from contaminated water. A mixture of 38 pesticides was tested and the concentrations of 17 of these were found to be reduced significantly in the biopellet treatment, compared with the control. After harvesting, the concentration of total pesticides in the algal treatment did not differ significantly from that in the control. However, in the fungal treatment and biopellet treatment, the concentration was significantly lower (59.6 +/- 2.0 mu g/L and 56.1 +/- 2.8 mu g/L, respectively) than in the control (66.6 +/- 1.0 mu g/L). Thus fungal-assisted algal harvesting through biopellet formation can also provide scope for removing organic pollutants from wastewater, with removal mainly being performed by the fungus.

AB Over the years, adsorption has been the most widely applied technique for pollutants remediation in conventional water and wastewater treatment regimes with commendable results. Consequently, multiple adsorbents have been synthesized, characterized and tested for various pollutants sequestration such as; heavy metals, dyes, pharmaceutically active ingredients, among others, in aqueous media. Unfortunately, most of the sorbents face many inherent limitations such as high production cost, difficult separation of adsorbent from solution, and complex synthesis processes. Therefore, an efficient adsorbent that would be sustainably adopted for industrial application in wastewater treatment requires, among other properties, a simple and efficient recovery step from a continuous flowing system. The regenerated adsorbent must also possess near original properties after several cycles of reuse thereby resulting to low capital investment. To address this challenge, studies conducted in the past few years incorporating magnetism in both natural and synthetic sorbents to improve their removal from water via magnetic separation have yielded stupendous results compared to conventional technologies. This chapter concisely discusses synthesis methods and adsorption capacities and mechanisms of selected magnetic nanocomposite adsorbents under diverse physicochemical conditions for removal of cations, dyes and organic pollutants from wastewater. Magnetic nanocomposites present eco-friendly properties and are potential alternatives for application in water purification processes subject to commercial viability evaluation before practical use.

AB The effect of soluble bio-based organic substances (SBO) isolated from urban wastes on photochemical wastewater treatments was investigated using a mixture of six emerging pollutants (EPs), namely acetaminophen, caffeine, acetamiprid, clofibric acid, carbamazepine and amoxicillin. Solar simulated experiments showed that although SBO were able to enhance the indirect photolysis of the EPs, they could not compensate for the light screening effect produced by these colored materials. In contrast, SBO were able to enhance photo-Fenton at slightly acidic conditions (pH = 5.2), most probably increasing iron availability. In the later case, the order of reactivity (amoxicillin >= carbamazepine >= clofibric acid > caffeine > acetaminophen > acetamiprid) was similar to that of the rate constants determined for all six EPs with (OH)-O-center dot. Finally, experiments performed at pilot plant scale with real sunlight at pH = 5.2 and SBO showed that 5 of the EPs were removed in only 25 min and only acetamiprid was more resistant to the process. The overall results show not only how we can use waste to clean out wastes, but also contribute to the studies which show how wastes can become a source of revenue through the industrial exploitation of their chemical value.

AB The occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment has become a crucial topic in the last two decades owing to the innovative development of analytical instrumentation such as LC tandem MS. Using these new techniques it became obvious that pesticides, pharmaceuticals, ingredients of personal care products, biocides, flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds are entering rivers and streams via treated wastewater. Also contamination of bank filtrates, groundwater and in a few cases even drinking water was identified. Wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove polar persistent organic pollutants occurring in the sub-mg/L range and hence many of these organic pollutants are passing WWTPs to a high extent. Waterworks with a potential pesticide contamination in their raw water are equipped with advanced techniques such ozonation, activated carbon or nanofiltration enabling the removal of a high variety of other organic compounds. However, waterworks without an expected pesticide contamination are frequently equipped with common treatment processes not enabling the removal of these kinds of organic pollutants. Therefore, comprehensive management activities for protection of aquatic environments and water resources must consider the removal of all micropollutants relevant to water quality and ecology, independent of their usage or origin.

AB Detoxication technologies require the combination of theoretical and practical knowledges of xenobiotic biodegradation, wastewater treatment technologies, and management rules. The purpose of this complicated combination is to propose specialized strategies for detoxication, based on lab- and pilot-scale modeling. These strategies include preliminary created algorithms for preventing the risk of water pollution and sediments. The technologies and algorithms are essentially important outcome, applied in the textile, pharmaceutical cosmetic, woodtreating, and oiltreating industries.
   In this paper four rehabilitation technologies for pretreatment of water contaminated by pentachlorophenol (PCP) have been developed in the frame of the European and Bulgarian National projects. Emphasize is put on the biological systems and their potential of detoxication management. The light and transmission electron microscopy of the reconstructed activated sludges, the microbial, kinetic and enzymological indicators are presented and approved as critical points in the biocontrol.

AB A pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was installed and operated for one year at a Swiss hospital. It was fed an influent directly from the hospital's sanitary collection system. To study the efficiency of micropollutant elimination in raw hospital wastewater that comprises a complex matrix with micropollutant concentrations ranging from low ng/L to low mg/L, an automated online SPE-HPLC-MS/MS analytical method was developed. Among the 68 target analytes were the following: 56 pharmaceuticals (antibiotics, antimycotics, antivirals, iodinated X-ray contrast media, antiinflamatory, cytostatics, diuretics, beta blockers, anesthetics, analgesics, antiepileptics, antidepressants, and others), 10 metabolites, and 2 corrosion inhibitors. The MBR influent contained the majority of those target analytes. The micropollutant elimination efficiency was assessed through continuous flow-proportional sampling of the MBR influent and continuous time-proportional sampling of the MBR effluent. An overall load elimination of all pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the MBR was 22%, as over 80% of the load was due to persistent iodinated contrast media. No inhibition by antibacterial agents or disinfectants from the hospital was observed in the MBR. The hospital wastewater was found to be a dynamic system in which conjugates of pharmaceuticals deconjugate and biological transformation products are formed, which in some cases are pharmaceuticals themselves.

AB Triclosan, widely employed as an antimicrobial additive in many household personal care products, has recently been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluents and in source waters used for drinking water supplies. Chloramines used either as alternative disinfectants in drinking water treatment or formed during chlorination of nonnitrified wastewater effluents have the potential to react with triclosan. This study examined triclosan reactivity in chloraminated waters over the pH range of 6.5-10.5. Experimental and modeling results show that monochloramine directly reacts with the phenolate form of triclosan; however, the reaction is relatively slow as evinced by the second-order rate constant k(Ar0-NH2Cl) = 0.025 M-1 s(-1). Kinetic modeling indicates that for pH values less than 9.5, reactions between triclosan and two monochloramine autodecomposition intermediates, hypochlorous acid (k(Ar0-HOCl) = 5.4 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1)) and dichloramine (k(Ar0-NHCl2) = 60 M-1 s(-1)), are responsible for a significant percentage of the observed triclosan decay. The products of these reactions include three chlorinated triclosan byproducts as well as 2,4- dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. Low levels of chloroform were detected after 1 week at pH values of 6.5 and 7.5. The slow reactivity of triclosan in the presence of chloramines explains the recalcitrance of this species in nonnitrified wastewater effluents.

AB Developing advanced treatment technologies for improving the removal of micropollutants in water/wastewater is important. A suitable treatment is more likely to be used as the polishing step in the treatment scheme. Advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) are relevant for removing micropollutants. The ability of direct UV photolysis and selected AOTs to degrade pharmaceuticals, endocrine-disrupting compound and herbicide has been studied and compared. The tested methods resulted in the degradation of the studied micropollutants; however, none of the methods was preferred for the removal of all tested compounds. The UV-active processes have strong potential for removal of the studied micropollutants. The utilisation of a moderate hydrogen peroxide admixture resulted in a more reliable treatment.

AB Since conventional treatment technologies may fail in removing many micro-pollutants, there is currently a focus on the potential of additional treatment technologies for improved sewage treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate six different effluents from Henriksdal Sewage Treatment Plant in Stockholm, Sweden. The effluents were; conventionally treated effluent (chemical phosphorous removal in combination with an activated sludge process, including biological nitrogen removal and a sand filter), with additional treatments individually added to the conventional treatment; active carbon filtration, ozonation at 5 mg l(-1), ozonation at 15 mg l(-1), ozonation at 5 mg l(-1) + moving bed biofilm reactor and irradiation with ultraviolet radiation + hydrogen peroxide. The evaluation was done by characterizing and comparing the effluents using a Lefkovitch matrix model based on a life cycle test with the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes, combined with analysis of juvenile development and survival over time.
   The conventionally treated effluent resulted in the most negative effects, leading to the conclusion that all additional treatments in the present study created effluents with less negative impacts on the copepod populations. The ozone treatments with the low dose treatment in particular, resulted in the overall least negative effects. Moving bed biofilm reactor combined with ozone did not improve the quality of the effluent in the sense that slightly more negative effects on the population abundance were seen for this treatment technology compared to ozonation alone. The active carbon treatment had more negative effects than the ozone treatments, most of which could possibly be explained by removal of essential metal ions. The effluent which was treated with ultraviolet radiation + hydrogen peroxide resulted in few developmental and survival effects over time, but still showed negative effects on the population level. Matrix population modeling proved a useful tool for biologically characterizing and comparing the effluents. Basing the assessment either on the individual level data (development and survival over time or total reproductive output) or the population level data (lambda values and projected population abundances) would not have resulted in the same conclusions as combining both analyses. The juvenile development and survival over time allowed for closer monitoring of the important molting process, whereas the population modeling provided an integrated measure of potential effects at the population level. If the dilution of the effluent in the recipient is considered, the biological effects recorded in the present study were not of substantial significance for the copepod populations, regardless of treatment technology.

AB Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have become material of special attention due to their high porosity and large surface area. Adsorptive removal of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride using MOFs from aqueous waste and real wastewater has been studied in this work. The MOF-5 synthesized showed higher adsorption capacity as compared to activated charcoal. The adsorption satisfies the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and adsorption isotherm is very well explained by the Freundlich and the Sips isotherm. The adsorption mechanism may be explained by the electrostatic interactions of the pharmaceutical compounds and the MOF-5 surface. Finally, it can be concluded that MOF-5 has shown a great potential for their application in wastewater treatment technology development.

AB Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. In this work, biologically produced manganese oxides (BioMnOx) were investigated to remove diclofenac. At neutral pH, the diclofenac oxidation with BioMnOx was 10-fold faster than with chemically produced MnO2. The main advantage of BioMnOx over chemical MnO2 is the ability of the bacteria to reoxidize the formed Mn2+, which inhibits the oxidation of diclofenac. Diclofenac-2,5-iminoquinone was identified as a major transformation product accounting for 5-10% of the transformed diclofenac. Except for 5-hydroxydiclofenac, which was identified as an intermediate, no other oxidation products were detected. Diclofenac oxidation was proportional to the amount of BioMnOx dosed, and the pseudo first order rate constant k was 6-fold higher when pH was decreased from 6.8 to 6.2. The Mn2+ levels remained below the drinking water limit (0.05 mg L-1), thus indicating the efficient in situ microbiological regeneration of the oxidant. These results combined with previous studies suggest the potential of BioMnOx for STP effluent polishing.

AB Separating urine from domestic wastewater promotes a more sustainable municipal wastewater treatment system. This study investigated the feasibility of applying a forward osmosis (FO) dewatering process for nutrient recovery from source-separated urine under different conditions, using seawater or desalination brine as a low-cost draw solution. The filtration process with the active layer facing feed solution exhibited relatively high water fluxes up to 20 L/m(2)-h. The process also revealed relatively low rejection to neutral organic nitrogen (urea-N) in fresh urine but improved rejection of ammonium (50-80%) in hydrolyzed urine and high rejection (>90%) of phosphate, potassium in most cases. Compared to simulation based on the solution diffusion mechanism, higher water flux and solute flux were obtained using fresh or hydrolyzed urine as the feed, which was attributed to the intensive forward nutrient permeation (i.e., of urea, ammonium, and potassium). Membrane fouling could be avoided by prior removal of the spontaneously precipitated crystals in urine. Compared to other urine treatment options, the current process was cost-effective and environmentally friendly for nutrient recovery from urban wastewater at source, yet a comprehensive life-cycle impact assessment might be needed to evaluate and optimize the overall system performance at pilot and full scale operation.

AB Climate change scenarios predict an increase of extreme rain events, which will increase the risk of wastewater flooding and of missing legal water quality targets. This study elicits the willingness to pay to reduce ecological and health risks from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in rivers and lakes, and wastewater flooding of residential and commercial zones under the uncertainty of climate change. We implement a discrete choice experiment on a large representative sample of the Swiss population. We find that about 71% of the respondents are willing to pay a higher annual local tax to reduce the risk of CSOs in rivers and lakes. Swiss households strongly value the protection of water bodies, and mostly, the avoidance of high ecological risks and health risks for children related to CSOs in rivers and lakes. Our findings also show that climate change perception has a significant effect on the willingness to pay to reduce these risks. These results are important to support policy makers' decisions on how to deal with emerging risks of climate change in the water sector and where to set priorities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB This scientific note reviews current approaches for using membrane technology to treat wastewater from food processing, for example, as a means to produce water by recovering components with high added value. In addition, with regard to the availability of wastewater, processes that contain membranes have been shown to be advantageous in terms of treating waste, recovering solutes, and producing water. With regard to the latter, processes that contain membranes can be considered to be a sustainable methodology given the valorization of waste. Lastly, this note provides a brief general view emphasizing a real need to apply membrane technology in the food industry, and indicates that its application is undoubtedly to come.

AB A listing of "priority pharmaceuticals" for human use in Italy resulted in the selection of 26 pharmaceuticals, belonging to 11 therapeutic classes. They were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, their occurrence was assessed in six sewage treatment plants (STPs), and the loads and the removal rates (RR) were studied. Total loads ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 g/day/1000 inhabitants in influents and 1.0 and 3.0 g/day/1000 inhabitants in effluents. Total RR in STPs were mostly lower than 40%. Pharmaceuticals could be divided into three groups according to their behavior in STPs: one group with RR higher in summer than in winter, one group with RR similar in summer and winter, and a last group not removed. Last, we studied the distribution and fate of residual pharmaceuticals in the surface waters receiving the effluents of the UPS and identified degradation and sorption as the major factors affecting attenuation. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole (antibiotics), atenolol (cardiovascular drug), ibuprofen (antiinflammatory), furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide (diuretics), ranitidine (gastrointestinal drug), and bezafibrate (lipid regulator) were the most abundant residual drugs, thus those of environmental concern.

AB Naproxen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Recently, this medicine was detected both in natural waters (up to 1.5 mu g L-1) and in sewage treatment plant effluents (up to 5.2 mu g L-1). Moreover, naproxen is only partly eliminated by classical processes used in sewage treatment plants. Therefore, its degradation is of utmost interest. Advanced oxidation processes proved to be the most suitable methods for the elimination of persistent organic contaminants. In this work ultraviolet (UV, 254 nm), vacuum ultraviolet photolysis (VUV, 172 nm) and their combination (UV/VUV, 254/185 nm) were investigated. The efficiency of the methods increased in the following order: UV < VUV < UV/VUV photolysis. However, VUV irradiation was found to mineralize the contaminant molecule most effectively. The chemical structures of three out of four aromatic by-products and of some aliphatic carboxylic acids were presumed. The effects of dissolved O-2 and the initial concentration of naproxen on the degradation were also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A terephthalic acid functionalized g-C3N4 (TACN) was newly developed and utilized in the development of visible-light-driven magnetically recyclable TACN/TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2 (TTFS) Z-scheme heterojunction nanophotocatalyst. The characterization was performed by BET surface area analyzer, TEM, UV-vis DRS, VSM, XRD, and XPS. To ensure its practical applicability, the experiments were also performed for real sewage effluent spiked with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in which degradation of 97 % of the 2 mg L-1 of ibuprofen in 120 min, 94 % of the 2 mg L-1 of benzophenone-3 in 150 min, and 94 % of the 2 mg L-1 of carbamazepine in 240 min was achieved upon 330W m(-2) of integrated visible light irradiance. The recycling of the TTFS nanophotocatalyst was achieved without adopting calcination or heating within a short contact time (5 h), maintaining a photocatalytic efficiency of over 83% after 5 cycles, which proves its potential for real practical applications.

AB The presence of antibiotics in different environmental matrices is a growing concern. The introduction of antibiotics into the soil is mainly due to sewage treatment plants. Once in the soil, antibiotics may become toxic to microbial communities and, as a consequence, can pose a risk to the environment and human health. This study evaluates the potential toxicity of the antibiotic clarithromycin (CLA) in relation to the bacterial community of 12 soils with different characteristics. Bacterial community growth was evaluated in soils spiked in the laboratory with different concentrations of CLA after 1, 8, and 42 incubation days. The results indicated that the addition of clarithromycin to the soil may cause toxicity in the bacterial communities of the soil. In addition, it was observed that toxicity decreases between 1 and 8 incubation days, while the bacterial community recovers completely in most soils after 42 incubation days. The results also show that soil pH and effective cation exchange capacity may influence CLA toxicity.

AB Estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (e-EDCs) are present in treated sewage and there is concern about estrogenicity of potable recycled water. However e-EDCs are also present in other environmental media and intake from water needs to be considered in relation to these other sources. The concentrations of 13 e-EDCs in foodstuffs and drinking water are reviewed, their predicted concentrations in recycled water are estimated, and the daily estrogenic intake as 17 beta-estradiol equivalent (EEq) based on both in vitro and in vivo potencies is calculated as 1.39 and 9.65 mu g EEq/d, respectively. Dietary intake accounts for more than 99.8% of that total, and more than 84.2% is due to phytosterols. Drinking 2 L of recycled water per day is expected to add 0.001 to 0.016 mu g EEq/d based on in vitro and in vivo potencies, respectively. Exposure to e-EDCs in recycled water is therefore likely to be insignificant compared to current dietary intakes.

AB High-rate activated sludge (HRAS) systems are designed to shift the energy-intensive processes to energy-saving and sustainable technologies for wastewater treatment. The high food-to-microorganism (F/M) ratios and low solid retention times (SRTs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) applied in HRAS systems result in the maximization of organic matter diversion to the sludge which can produce large amounts of biogas during anaerobic digestion, thus moving toward energy-neutral (or positive) treatment processes. However, in addition to the energy optimization, the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) is the new challenge in wastewater treatment. In the context of this study, the removal efficiencies and the fates of selected ECs (three endocrine disruptors (endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs))-nonylphenol, bisphenol A and triclosan, and four pharmaceuticals (PhACs)-ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ketoprofen) in HRAS systems have been studied. According to the results, EDCs occurred in raw wastewater and secondary sludge at higher concentrations compared to PhACs. In HRAS operating schemes, all compounds were poorly (<40%) to moderately (<60%) removed. Regarding removal mechanisms, biotransformation was found to be the dominant process for PhACs, while for EDCs sorption onto sludge is the most significant removal mechanism affecting their fates and their presence in excess sludge.

AB Solids retention time (SRT) is one of the most important factors in designing and operating activated sludge systems for biological wastewater treatment. Longer SRTs have been shown to alter the structure and function of microbial communities, thereby leading to improved treatment efficacy with respect to bulk and trace organics, nutrient removal, and membrane fouling. Research has also shown that longer SRTs and/or higher influent antibiotic concentrations may lead to increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance. However, it is unclear whether elevated, yet subclinical, concentrations of antibiotics also impact the overall microbial community. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in microbial community structure in a laboratory-scale activated sludge system as a function of SRT (2-20 days) and influent concentrations (1x-100x ambient) of ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Changes in microbial community structure were evaluated based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial community function was evaluated based on changes in effluent water quality, including attenuation of bulk and trace organics. The results confirmed that longer SRTs-but not antibiotic loadings-had a significant impact on microbial community structure and effluent water quality. Therefore, moderate spikes in influent antibiotic concentrations are not expected to adversely impact biological wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Water Environment Federation

AB The ZVI/H2O2 process was applied for cosmetic wastewater treatment. Two commercial zero-valent iron (ZVI) types with different granulations were chosen: Hepure Ferrox PRB and Hepure Ferrox Target. In addition, the pH and stirring method influence on ZVI/H2O2 process efficiency was studied. During the ZVI and ZVI/H2O2 processes, linear Fe ions concentration increase was observed. The addition of H2O2 significantly accelerated the iron dissolution process. The highest COD removal was obtained using finer ZVI (Hepure Ferrox Target) for doses of reagents ZVI/H2O2 1500/1600mg/L, in a H2O2/COD weight ratio 2:1, at pH 3.0 with stirring on a magnetic stirrer. After 120min of the process, 84.0% COD removal (from 796 to 127mg/L) was achieved. It was found that the efficiency of the process depends, as in the case of the Fenton process, on the ratio of the reagents (ZVI/H2O2) and their dose in relation to the COD (H2O2/COD) but does not depend on the dose of the iron itself. Statistical analysis confirms that COD removal efficiency depends primarily on H2O2/COD ratio and ZVI granulation, but ZVI dose influence is not statistically significant. The head space, solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry results confirm high efficiency of the ZVI/H2O2 process.

AB This study investigates the degradation of the beta-blockers in hospital wastewater by direct ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation with a focus on measurements at different initial pHs and Fe2+ concentrations, and the determination of kinetic constants. The results showed that these 'emerging contaminants' were completely degraded, when the removal rate of organic matter reached 30.6% and 49.1% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. Likewise, the aromaticity removal rates were 63.4% and 77.9% for zonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. The experimental design showed that pH was the variable which had the greatest effect on the Fe2+/ozonation. The kinetic constants of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol degradation by direct ozonation complied with pseudo-first-order conditions, while Fe2+/ozonation was suited to a biphasic degradation model. The k(obs) tended to rise when the pH increases; propranolol showed high k(obs), which can be attributed to the naphthalene group (an electron-rich moiety). The identification of degradation products was carried out in aqueous solution using HPLC-MS2, followed by a suggestion of degradation pathways by means of ozonation. The degradation products proved to be dependent on the initial pH, and followed pathways that are based on direct ozonolysis and free radicals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) are biologically recalcitrant chemicals that are often detected in wastewater-impacted environments at higher concentrations than other pharmaceutical micropollutants of concern. Diatrizoate is an anionic ICM that is especially resistant to conventional wastewater and drinking water treatment processes. This study examined the aqueous photocatalytic treatment of diatrizoate using nanophase titanium dioxide (TiO2). Experiments demonstrated that diatrizoate can be degraded in aqueous TiO2 suspensions illuminated with ultraviolet-A (UVA) light. In oxic solutions, diatrizoate degraded principally via oxidation by adsorbed hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), releasing iodine substituents stoichiometrically, but causing little mineralization of organic carbon and nitrogen. Introduction of (OH)-O-center dot scavengers significantly slowed the rate of photocatalytic degradation. At circumneutral pH, diatrizoate was oxidized much more slowly than iopromide, a nonionic ICM, in part because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged TiO2 surface; increased rates of oxidation observed at lower pH conditions can be attributed to more favorable diatrizoate-TiO2 sorptive interactions. Experiments also demonstrated that diatrizoate was degraded at appreciable rates in anoxic solutions, and reductive dehalogenation products are identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The higher selectivity of reductive processes suggests a promising strategy for targeted treatment of recalcitrant ICM in organic-rich matrices like wastewater effluent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ozonation of two pharmaceutical compounds: the drug diclofenac (DCF) and the synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethynylstradiol (EST), has been studied in laboratory prepared water and domestic wastewater in the presence of perovskite catalysts. In ultrapure water, catalysts do not lead to any improvement on the ozonation rates of DCF and EST which supports the fact that both compounds are removed by direct ozonation. TOC removal, on the other hand, is significantly increased in the presence of perovskite catalysts, especially when copper perovskite is used, with TOC removals in the order of 90% after 120 minutes of reaction. In domestic wastewater the results are similar regarding the mechanism of initial pharmaceutical compounds removal, which are due to direct reactions with ozone that, in this case, develop during longer reaction times likely due to the presence of other contaminants. Then, regarding TOC removal in domestic wastewater, negligible differences between non-catalytic and catalytic ozonation are observed during the first approximately 25 minutes of reaction. For higher reaction time, TOC removal is improved only in the case copper perovskite catalyst is used although percentages of TOC removal are comparatively lower than those reached in ultrapure water (they hardly reach 50% TOC removal). Finally, a kinetic study has been carried out and apparent rate constants of the heterogeneous reaction between ozone and TOC on the catalyst surface have been determined.

AB Hypoxia (low oxygen) often occurs in aquatic ecosystems that receive effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The combination of hypoxia and WWTP effluent could impair fish health, because WWTP effluent contains multiple contaminants that could disrupt the physiological pathways fish use to cope with hypoxia, but the interactive effects of these stressors on fish physiology are poorly understood. We have examined this issue by exposing mummichog killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to hypoxia (5 and 2 kPa O2) and/or 100% WWTP effluent for 21 days in a full factorial design. We then measured hypoxia tolerance, whole-animal metabolism, gill morphology, haematology, and tissue metabolites. In clean water, killifish responded to chronic hypoxia with improvements in hypoxia tolerance, as reflected by increases in time to loss of equilibrium at 0.5 kPa (tLOE). These improvements occurred in association with increases in the exposed surface of gill lamellae that resulted from a regression of interlamellar cell mass (ILCM). Concurrent exposure to wastewater attenuated the increases in tLOE and gill remodeling in chronic hypoxia, and nearly depleted brain glycogen stores. Therefore, exposure to WWTP effluent can disrupt the physiological mechanisms fish use to cope with chronic hypoxia and impair hypoxia tolerance. Our research suggests that the combination of stressors near WWTPs can have interactive effects on the physiology and health of fish.

AB The present study evaluates the removal capacity of two high rate algae ponds (HRAPs) to eliminate 12 pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and 26 of their corresponding main metabolites and transformation products. The efficiency of these ponds, operating with and without primary treatment, was compared in order to study their capacity under the best performance conditions (highest solar irradiance). Concentrations of all the target compounds were determined in both water and biomass samples. Removal rates ranged from moderate (40-60 %) to high (>60 %) for most of them, with the exception of the psychiatric drugs carbamazepine, the ss-blocking agent metoprolol and its metabolite, metoprolol acid. O-desmethylvenlafaxine, despite its very low biodegradability in conventional wastewater treatment plants, was removed to certain extent (13-39 %). Biomass concentrations suggested that bioadsorption/bioaccumulation to microalgae biomass was decisive regarding the elimination of non-biodegradable compounds such as venlafaxine and its main metabolites. HRAP treatment with and without primary treatment did not yield significant differences in terms of PhACs removal efficiency. The implementation of HRAPs as secondary treatment is a feasible alternative to CAS in terms of overall wastewater treatment, including organic micropollutants, with generally higher removal performances and implying a green, low-cost and more sustainable technology.

AB There have been rising concerns about micro-pollutants that are not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants. TiO2 photocatalysis is one of the most promising methods for their removal. One of the major challenges to the widespread application of TiO2 photocatalytic treatment is the use of fine TiO2 particles in suspension.
   A tray photocatalytic reactor based on using supported TiO2 as a photocatalyst was designed and constructed. The reactor maintains a thin water film over TiO2 supported on sand grains. Reactor performance for the degradation of phenol as a model compound was evaluated using 3 different approaches: (1) direct immobilization using the sol gel technique, (2) coating with TiO2/cement grout; and (3) binding with TiO2-epoxy coating.
   The recirculating tray configuration achieved photocatalyst activation, turbulent flow, avoiding treatment dead zones, and continuous water oxygenation. The reactor performance using the epoxy TiO2 sand composite was satisfactory in terms of degradation efficiency. The water turbidity remained unchanged indicating photocatalyst resistance to abrasion. Successful operation of the tray photo-reactor in the continuous mode was also achieved. The tray reactor is suitable for scale-up and commercialization due to five distinctive features which are: modular design; integrated storage; ease of continuous mode operation; absence of need for UV transmitting components; robustness and low cost of the epoxy-TiO2-sand composite.

AB The widespread occurrence of feminized male fish downstream of some UK Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTWs) has been associated with exposure to estrogenic and potentially antiandrogenic (AA) contaminants in the effluents. In this study, profiling of AA contaminants in WwTW effluents and fish was conducted using HPLC in combination with in vitro androgen receptor transcription screens. Analysis of extracts of wastewater effluents revealed complex profiles of AA activity comprising 21-53 HPLC fractions. Structures of bioavailable antiandrogens were identified by exposing rainbow trout to a WwTW effluent and profiling the bile for AA activity using yeast (anti-YAS) and mammalian-based (AR-CALUX) androgen receptor transcription screens. The predominant fractions with AA activity in both androgen receptor screens contained the germicides chlorophene and triclosan, and together these contaminants accounted for 51% of the total anti-YAS activity in the fish bile. Other AA compounds identified in bile included chloroxylenol, dichlorophene, resin acids, napthols, oxybenzone, 4-nonylphenol, and bisphenol A. Pure standards of these compounds were active in the androgen receptor screens at potencies relative to flutamide of between 0.1 and 13.0. Thus, we have identified, for the first time, a diverse range of AA chemicals in WwTWs that are bioavailable to fish and which need to be assessed for their risk to the reproductive health of these organisms and other aquatic biota.

AB In this work, periphyton photobioreactors were built and were used for the treatment of synthetic wastewater spiked with PPCPs under different operational conditions. The removal rates of total nitrogen were relatively stable and varied from 39% to 77% overtime in different treatments. However, the removal rates of soluble reactive phosphorus decreased overtime from 42% to 68% on day 2 to 15.8% to 44% on day 22. For the selected PPCPs, only bisphenol A was effectively removed (72%-86.4%), hydrochlorothiazide and ibuprofen were moderately removed (26.2%-48.7%), and carbamazepine and gemfibrozil were poorly removed (6.45%-20.6%). Longer hydraulic retention time enhanced the treatment efficiency but illumination period showed contrasting effects on the removal of the nutrients and the PPCPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID WASTE-WATER; MEMBRANE DISTILLATION
AB Forward osmosis (FO) is one of the new membrane processes used to recover water from wastewater. FO as a low-energy treatment method requires a draw solution instead of a hydraulic force. Therefore, introducing an optimal draw solution for more prolific commercial FO technology applications is a chronic issue. In this report, sodium alginate sulfate (SAS) was simply synthesized, characterized, and employed as a biodegradable osmotic agent in the FO process. The sulfonation degree, ion exchange capacity, and concentration of SAS as a draw solution were optimized. The polyionic structure of the SAS increased its hydrophilicity and osmotic pressure. The average water flux for 0.11 g mL(-1) SAS solution was obtained as 28.5 L m(-2)h(-1) with the reverse solute flux of 3.4 g m(-2)h(-1) using deionized water as feed solution. The SAS was successfully used as a draw solution for brackish and brine water and the Caspian Seawater in the FO process. The wastewaters from various sources, including domestic, oil and gas refinery, petrochemical, power plant, food, pharmaceutical, and automotive manufacturing, have been utilized as feed solutions for FO treatment. The results showed that the SAS was also useful for water recovery from wastewater. The low-pressure reverse osmosis process was accomplished to regenerate the SAS draw solution easily. The regenerated draw solution was repeatedly used for the FO process.

AB Climate change and the increased demand for food amplified the global problem with water supply for irrigation. This work deals with the reclamation of municipal wastewater (MWW) for irrigation by a membrane bioreactor (MBR), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO). The emphasis was on the comparison of physico-chemical and microbiological parameters with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) guidelines. In addition, the detection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) from the Watch List (EU Decision 2015/495) were examined. Firstly, the MWW was monitored (physico-chemical and microbiological parameters, trace elements, and occurrence of CECs) for six months. Thereafter, the MWW was treated with MBR, NF, and RO. The reclaimed water satisfied the physico-chemical and microbiological quality requirements only after additional NF/RO treatment. Membrane bioreactor efficiently removed methiocarb (>99.9%), tri-allate (>99.9%), clothianidin (88.0%), and clarithromycin (71.9-74.2%), while the removal of azithromycin, acetamiprid, and oxadiazonwas around 30%. The lowand even negative removal during MBR treatment was observed for diclofenac (15%), clothianidin (-14%), imidacloprid (-18%), and diclofenac (-157%). Additional treatment of MBR effluent with NF90 and XLE membranes resulted in complete rejection of detected CECs, while NF270 membrane achieved results between 75% and 91%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study investigated the degradability of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by ozonation for the treatment of secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. A set of experiments were conducted in a laboratory using a pilot-scale process consisting of three flow-through reactors in series, by varying the ozone dose (1-9mg L-1), the hydraulic retention time (5-15 min), and the concentration of ozone injected into the reactors (14-42 mg L-1). Thirty-seven PPCPs were detected in the secondary effluent, which belongs to the use categories of antibiotics, analgesics, antiarrhythmic agents, anticonvulsants, vasodilators, lipid modifying agents, anti-itch drugs, anti-psychotic drugs, insect repellents, bronchodilators, diuretics, peptic ulcer drugs, NMDA receptor antagonists, antifungal drugs, antimicrobial drugs, and antineoplastic agents. These PPCPs were broadly classified into five groups ranging from sensitive to ozone (O-3) or unstable in the ozonation process, to the group of insensitive to O-3 or very stable in the ozonation process. These groups are based on the PPCP concentrations after the ozone treatment and their limit of detection (LOD). Furthermore, this study examined comparatively the effects of the ozone dose, the retention (reaction) time, and the concentration of O-3 supplied to the reactors on the degradability of the PPCPs.

AB Removal of emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, from wastewater is a challenge. Adsorption is a simple and efficient process that can be applied. Clays, which are natural and low-cost materials, have been investigated as adsorbent. In this work, raw vermiculite and its three modified forms (expanded, base, and acid/base treated) were tested for removal of a widely used antidepressant, venlafaxine. Adsorption kinetics followed Elovich's model for raw vermiculite while the pseudo-2nd order model was a better fit in the case of other materials. Equilibrium followed Langmuir's model for the raw and the acid/base-treated vermiculite, while Redlich-Peterson's model fitted better the expanded and the base-treated materials. The adsorption capacity of vermiculite was significantly influenced by the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the materials caused by the treatments. The base-treated, raw, and expanded vermiculites showed lower maximum adsorption capacities (i.e., 6.3 +/- 0.5, 5.8 +/- 0.7, 3.9 +/- 0.2 mg g(-1), respectively) than the acid/base-treated material (33 +/- 4 mg g(-1)). The acid/base-treated vermiculite exhibited good properties as a potential adsorbent for tertiary treatment of wastewater in treatment plants, in particular for cationic species as venlafaxine due to facilitation of diffusion of the species to the interlayer gallery upon such treatment.

AB Anaerobic sludge granules were obtained from laboratory-scale anaerobic bioreactors used to treat pharmaceutical-like (methanol-, acetone- and propanol-contaminated) wastewater under low-temperature conditions (15 degrees C). The microbial diversity and diversity changes of the sludge samples were ascertained by applying 16S rRNA gene cloning and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analyses, respectively, and using sludge samples from the inoculum, throughout and at the conclusion of the bioreactor trial. Data from genetic fingerprinting correlated well with those from physiological activity assays of the reactor biomass. Specifically, for example, TRFLP profiles indicated the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens within the archaeal community, thus supporting the findings of specific methanogenic activity measurements. TRFLP data supported the hypothesis that the deviation between the replicated reactors, in terms of treatment efficiency, was associated with succession within the microbial communities present, and indicated that community development was linked to both operating temperature and wastewater composition. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was also applied, to quantitatively assess the abundance of selected microbial groups, and revealed the underestimation of the abundance Methanosarcina by gene cloning analysis and demonstrated the spatial arrangement of these organisms within the architecture of the lowtemperature solvent-degrading anaerobic biofilms.

AB Fishes in estuarine waters are frequently exposed to treated wastewater effluent, among numerous other sources of contaminants, yet the impacts of these anthropogenic chemicals are not well understood in these dynamic and important waterways. Inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) at an early stage of development [12 days posthatch (dph)] were exposed to waters from two estuarine wastewater-treatment outfall locations in a tidal estuary, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta (California, USA) that had varied hydrology and input volumes. The genomic response caused by endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these waters was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a suite of hormonally regulated genes. Relative androgenic and estrogenic activities of the waters were measured using CALUX reporter bioassays. The presence of bifenthrin, a pyrethroid pesticide and known EDC, as well as caffeine and the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen, which were used as markers of wastewater effluent input, were determined using instrumental analysis. Detectable levels of bifenthrin (2.89 ng L-1) were found on one of the sampling dates, and caffeine was found on all sampling dates, in water from the Boynton Slough. Neither compound was detected at the Carquinez Strait site, which has a much smaller effluent discharge input volume relative to the receiving water body size compared with Boynton Slough. Water samples from both sites incubated in the CALUX cell line induced estrogenic and androgenic activity in almost all instances, though the estrogenicity was relatively higher than the androgenicity. Changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts of endocrine-responsive genes and indicators of general chemical stress were observed after a 96-h exposure to waters from both locations. The relative levels of endocrine response, changes in gene transcript abundance, and contaminant concentrations were greater in water from the Boynton Slough site despite those effluents undergoing a more advanced treatment process. The availability of a widely geographically distributed estuarine model species (M. beryllina) now allows for improved assessment of treated effluent impacts across brackish, estuarine, and marine environments.

AB Water pollution within and nearby different livestock farm types was assessed comprehensively for the first time in Vietnam. The samples of wastewater, ground water, and surface water were collected from 130 pig farms, 80 poultry farms, and 40 cow farms. Water quality was first assessed by individual parameter evaluation method in which measured values of water quality parameters were compared with the permissible limits in the national technical regulations on livestock's effluent (QCVN 62), surface water quality, and ground water quality. Subsequently, the overall quality of surface and ground water samples was evaluated by mean of water quality index (WQI). The results showed the large variations in effluent's quality, implying the considerable differences in wastewater treatment efficiency within and among farm types. Effluent from livestock farms was highly polluted by organic matters (expressed as BOD5 and COD) and especially by microorganisms (expressed as total coliform-CF). Almost all wastewater samples contained higher number of CF than QCVN 62 (3900 MPN/100ml), with mean concentration of CF in effluent from cow farms, pig farms, and poultry farms were 1.2e+07 +/- 5.0e+07 MPN/100ml, 8.8e+04 +/- 7.1e+04 MPN/100ml, 1.5e+06 +/- 4.2e+06 MPN/100ml, respectively. Improperly treated livestock's waste was likely to have impacts on quality of ground water and receiving surface water bodies. High CF contamination in effluent leads to 70% of the ground water samples in cow farms and poultry farms classified as unsuitable for drinking water supply by WQI values. Although effluent from poultry farms had smaller quantity and better quality, their receiving surface water bodies exhibited the worst quality, with average WQI of 37.5 +/- 16.2 compared to 49.9 +/- 12 of pig farms and 50.3 +/- 20.8 of cow farms. This result suggests that livestock's effluent was not only pollution source of surface water bodies nearby livestock farms.

AB Wastewater may contain a diverse group of unregulated pollutants known as emerging pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Triclosan (TCS) is a personal care product widely used as an antiseptic or preservative in cosmetics, hand wash, toothpaste and deodorant soaps. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been used as effective and alternative treatments for complex wastewater. However, an important criterion for the assessment of AOPs and their operation conditions could be the potential formation of new toxic secondary products, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Is), especially when emerging pollutants are present in the media. If these are omitted from environmental management studies, the real environmental impacts of a WWIPs (wastewater treatment plants) may be underestimated. Consequently, the current study aims to evaluate the environmental impacts derived from electrooxidation (EOX), one of the most effective oxidation technologies, of emerging pollutants using Life Cycle Assessment. The analyses were performed for the treatment of effluents containing TCS, firstly without considering the formation of PCDD/Fs and, thereafter, considering the effects of these compounds. Total toxicity, calculated through different methods and corresponding impact factors, were evaluated for each stage of the process when different electrolytes are used, including PCDD/Fs formation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to study i) the effect of the TCS initial concentration on the environmental impacts associated to ecotoxicity for the different life cycle methods and ii) the influence of changing the organic pollutant on PCDD/Fs formation employing 2-chlorophenol (2-CP). As a result, LCIA methods demonstrate that they are not fully adapted to the computation of PCDD/Fs in the water compartment, since only 2,3,7,8-tetraclorodibenzo-p-dioxina (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is present as a substance in the impact categories assessed, ignoring the remaining list of PCDD/Fs.

AB The ever-increasing concentrations of micropollutants (MPs) found at the outlet of conventional wastewater treatments plants, is a serious environmental concern. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM)-based nanofiltration (NF) membranes are seen as an attractive approach for MPs removal from wastewater effluents. In this work, PEMs of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were coated in a layer by layer (LbL) fashion on the surface of a polyacrylonitrile ultrafiltration support to obtain PEM-based NF membranes. The impact of PEM post-treatment, by applying salt and thermal annealing, was then investigated in terms of swelling, hydrophilicity, permeability, and ion rejection. While thermal annealing produced a more compact structure of PEM, it did not improve the ion rejection. Among the different salt concentrations examined for the salt-annealing process, the highest ion rejection was observed for (PAH/PAA)(15) membranes annealed in 100 mM NaNO3, interestingly without any decrease in the water permeability. This membrane was studied for the rejection of four MPs including Diclofenac, Naproxen, 4n-Nonylphenol and Ibuprofen from synthetic secondary-treated wastewater, over a filtration time of 54 h. At an early stage of filtration, the membrane became more hydrophobic and a good correlation was found between the compounds hydrophobicity and their rejection. As the filtration continued until the membrane saturation, an increase in membranes hydrophilicity was observed. Hence, in the latter stage of filtration, the role of hydrophobic interactions faded-off and the role of molecular and spatial dimensions emerged instead in MPs rejection. To test the suitability of the membranes for the ease of cleaning and repeated use, the sacrificial PEMs and foulants were completely removed, followed by re-coating of PEMs on the cleaned membrane. The higher MPs rejection observed in salt-annealed membranes compared to the non-annealed counterparts (52-82% against 43-69%), accompanied with still low ion rejection, confirm the high potential of PEM post-treatment to achieve better performing PEM-based NF membranes.

AB The occurrence of drugs in wastewater has been considered an imminent risk to the population, for the treatments used are usually ineffective. The presence of four popular drug residues (metformin, paracetamol, tetracycline, and enalapril) in hospital effluents, by using ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) with electrospray (ESI) ionization, and removal/degradation by membrane bioreactor (MBR) system are investigated in this study. For analysis method, all standard calibration curves showed satisfactory linearity (R (2) aeyen 0.993) within a relatively wide range. The recovery was between 70.4 and 105.0 %, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) values were within the ranges of 8.2 and 13.5 %. The effluent samples were collected at the end of the process treated in a bench-scale MBR treatment system and preconcentrated on solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Following that procedure, the chemical analysis demonstrated that the MBR system was effective in enalapril 94.3 +/- 7.63 %, tetracycline 99.4 +/- 0.02 %, and paracetamol 98.8 +/- 0.86 % removal. However, the polar metformin was less effectively removed (35.4 +/- 12.49 %). Moreover, the degradation products were investigated using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) by quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF), which has been indicated a tetracycline metabolite. In order to investigate the environmental impact, the wastewater potential risk was evaluated. The risk quotient (RQ) by measure environmental concentration (MEC) and its predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) ratio (RQ = MEC/PNEC) was between 0.003 (enalapril) to 0.815 (paracetamol). Finally, this work demonstrates that UFLC-MS/MS (ESI-Q) is a sensitive and selective method for drug analysis in wastewater and with ESI-Q-TOF has the accuracy required for determining the degradation products of these compounds. Also, it indicated that membrane bioreactor systems represent a new generation of processes that have proved to outperform conventional treatment showing better effluent quality. The removal capacity studied in this work demonstrates the efficiency of this process.

AB Macrolide antibiotics are widely used (in the order of I g per person per year). They pass the body largely unchanged and are also not degraded in wastewater treatment plants. With not too much effort, they may be eliminated from their effluents by ozonation. The macrolide antibiotics have all a dimethylamino group at one of the carbohydrate residues in common. This functional group is the target of the ozone reaction, and clarithromycin has been selected here for a more detailed study. Since only the free amine reacts with ozone, the rate of reaction is pH dependent (at pH 7: k = 4 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). In analogy to the ozonolysis of trimethylamine, the main reaction is a transfer of an O-atom yielding the N-oxide (identified by HPLC/MS-MS). A minor product (10%, based on formaldehyde yields) is demethylated clarithromycin (identified by HPLC/MS-MS). The dimethylamino group is thought to be essential for the binding of the macrolide antibiotics to their target. As a consequence, chemical changes of this functional group, notably the formation of the N-oxide that is no longer a proton acceptor, inactivates these drugs as assayed by the suppression of the growth of Pseudomonas putida. This is most important for wastewater treatment, as mineralization of clarithromycin by ozone would require 100 times as much ozone. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the increasing use and high excretion rates, high quantities of the antidiabetic drug sitagliptin (STG) enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In conventional biological treatment, only a moderate removal was achieved, and thus, STG can be detected in WWTP effluents with concentrations in the higher ng/L range. Ozonation is a widely discussed technique for advanced wastewater treatment. In lab-scale experiments, STG showed pH-dependent removal kinetics with a maximum apparent rate constant of k similar to 1 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1) at pH = 9. With an apparent rate constant of k(O3) = (1.8 +/- 0.7) x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) at pH 8, STG can be considered to be readily degraded by ozonation of WWTP effluents. Ozone attacks the primary amine moiety of STG, leading to nitro-STG (TP 437) (the primary amine moiety is transformed into a nitro group). Furthermore, a diketone (TP 406) was formed, which can be further degraded by ozone. Lab-scale and pilot-scale experiments on ozonation of WWTP effluents confirmed that the ozone attack of STG was incomplete even at high ozone doses of 1.7 and 0.9 mg O-3/mg DOC, respectively. These experiments confirmed that nitro-STG was formed as the main TP in the wastewater matrix. Two other TPs, TP 421c and TP 206b, were also detected, albeit with low intensities.

AB A novel rotating advanced oxidation contactor (RAOC) equipped with high-silica zeolite/TiO2 composite sheets was applied to remove sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and its transformation byproducts from fresh aquaculture wastewater (FAWW). Adsorption and photocatalysis of SMM was not interfered by coexisting substances in the FAWW. The combination of adsorption and photocatalysis by the RAOC degraded SMM more rapidly than photocatalysis alone, possibly because of the synergetic effect. Moreover, the increase in UV fluence rate (UVFR) enhanced SMM degradation, and the linear relationship between UVFR (0.9-3.6 J/cm(2)/h) and the rate constant for SMM degradation was observed. The removal behavior of the transformation byproducts generated via hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of SMM was investigated, and their degradation was inhibited by the coexisting substances. The RAOC treatment was repeated five times without exchanging the composite sheets to evaluate the reusability of the composite sheet. The RAOC stably and completely eliminated SMM from the FAWW, showing the zeolite was regenerated by the photocatalysis of SMM adsorbed in the composite sheets. The results demonstrated that the RAOC effectively and stably removed SMM and its transformation byproducts from the FAWW. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Vegetation filters (VFs), a type of land application system, are a robust technology based on natural treatment mechanisms for the removal of wastewater contaminants. Their capacity to attenuate emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) has not yet been evaluated. The present study reports the results of a 2-year EOC monitoring carried out using a poplar VF receiving wastewater primarily treated by an Imhoff tank. The compounds selected included analgesics, a beta-adrenergic blocker, stimulants, an anticonvulsant, an anti-depressant, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic and analgesic and stimulant metabolites. EOCs were analysed in the Imhoff tank effluent, in the infiltrated water at a depth of 90 cm and in the groundwater at a depth of 10 m. The results demonstrated that EOC attenuation was more significant in the first 90 cm than in the rest of the soil profile. The removal efficiency for all of the selected EOCs was higher than 90% with the exception of ketoprofen, which may pose a higher threat of groundwater contamination. The observed attenuation correlated with the hydrophobicity and charge state of the EOCs. The higher persistence of the metabolites 4-AAA and 4-FAA shows that progression in the degradation pathway does not always imply a mitigation of contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, the efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) upgraded with a powdered activated carbon unit for the reduction of micropollutants and the related advantages for fish health have been analyzed by means of different biomarkers, i.e. histopathological investigations, analyses of glycogen content and stress proteins, as well as by chemical analyses in different matrices. Comparative analyses were conducted prior and subsequent to the installation of the additional purification unit.
   Chemical analyses revealed a significant reduction of several pharmaceuticals, including diclofenac, carbamazepine and metoprolol, in samples of effluent and surface water downstream of the WWTP after its upgrade. In addition, diminished concentrations of diclofenac and PFOS were detected in tissues of analyzed fish.
   Histopathological investigations of fish liver, gills, and kidney revealed improved tissue integrity in fish after improved wastewater treatment. In parallel, biochemical measurements of glycogen revealed increased energy resources in fish liver and, furthermore, hsp70 levels in livers of exposed rainbow trout and in kidneys of exposed brown trout were lower after than before the WWTP upgrade. In summary, additional treatment with powdered activated carbon led to a reduction of potentially hazardous chemicals in the effluent and the adjacent river and, consequently, to an improvement of fish health in the receiving water course.

AB Innovative, nanotechnology-based remedies for the wastewater treatment processes are gaining momentum in recent years. Of particular interest is the containment of the environmental threat due to the contamination of water bodies by antibiotics, which can eventually lead to the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, causing grave concern to humanity. Herein we report a straightforward and simple method for the sunlight-assisted oxidative degradation of the antibiotic cefixime using a nanocomposite of TiO2 and nitrogen-doped holey graphene (TiO2/NHG) as a highly effective photocatalyst. Of the various catalysts tested TiO2/NHG is found to be superior towards the oxidative degradation of cefixime. The effect of various reaction parameters and presence of H2O2 are studied. The present methodology offers good scale-up possibilities.

AB Along with many other Pharmaceutically Active Compounds (PhACs), Diclofenac (DIC), Ibuprofen (IBU) and Paracetamol (PARA) are the most common type of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently reported in drinking and treated waters. Membranes can be used to inhibit the passage of micropollutants (Pharmaceuticals) into water that can be further reused. In this study, two types of loose nanofiltration membranes, that usually are applied for large molecular weight organics, were tested for the filtration of selected small molecular weight drugs from synthetic wastewater. Effect of pH on membrane efficiency showed that behavior of drugs altered with changing pH. Results showed impressive treatment of drugs in the order, DIC (99.7%) > IBU (81.2%) > PARA (49%) along with Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (95.3%) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (84%) removal. Interestingly, nanofiltration of wastewater containing IBU tablet increased to 90.2% as compared to pure drug (80.5%). Mixture of drugs showed decreased removal of DIC (23%) while removal rates for IBU and PARA increased to 17.1 and 67% respectively. Moderate to high rejection percentage was not due to the molecular sizes of the model drugs but hydrophobicity of drugs played role. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Water is a scarce resource and is considered a fundamental pillar of sustainable development. The modern development of society requires more and more drinking water. For this cleaner wastewater, treatments are key factors. Among those that exist, advanced oxidation processes are being researched as one of the sustainable solutions. The main objective of this manuscript is to show the scientific advances in this field. Methods: In this paper, a systematic analysis of all the existing scientific works was carried out to verify the evolution of this line of research. Results: It was observed that the three main countries researching this field are China, Spain, and the USA. Regarding the scientific collaboration between countries, three clusters were detected-one of Spain, one of China and the USA, and one of Italy and France. The publications are grouped around three types of water: industrial, urban, and drinking. Regarding the research, 15 clusters identified from the keywords analyzed the advanced oxidation process (alone or combined with biological oxidation) with the type of wastewater and the target pollutant, removal of which is intended. Finally, the most important scientific communities or clusters detected in terms of the number of published articles were those related to the elimination of pollutants of biological origin, such as bacteria, and of industrial nature, such as pesticides or pharmaceutical products.

AB The ever-increasing occurrence and persistence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in soils, sediments, drinking water supplies and wastewater effluents are a matter of serious environmental concern for governments and researchers worldwide. Nanofiltration as tertiary treatment method can be a viable and practical tool to remove these pollutants from aquatic environments. However, organic matter present in water sources can foul the membrane surface during operation, thus being potentially able to affect the membrane performance. Therefore, fouling mechanisms could heavily influence on the removal efficiencies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the implementation of three nano filtration membranes (TFC-SR2, NF-270 and MPS-34) and to study both the rejection of trace PhACs and the fouling mechanisms for each membrane as a function of feed solution pH. Fouling mechanisms were predicted by Hermia's model adapted to cross-flow configurations. Results demonstrated that higher removals were obtained at slightly alkaline pH, especially for anionic trace PhACs. At the same conditions, more severe fouling was observed, which resulted in strong flux declines and an increase in hydrophobicity. This indicates that the attached organic matter on the membrane surface acts as a secondary selective barrier for separation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies in pharmaceutical wastewater treated by Fenton process under response surface methodology (RSM) optimized conditions were studied. High regression coefficient value R-2 (R-2 = 0.9680, 0.9040 for AOX and TOC removal efficiency, respectively) and low value coefficient of variation (2.21%, 2.04% for AOX and TOC, respectively) of the quadratic model indicated that the model was accurate in predicting the experimental results. The desirability function was used to optimize AOX and TOC removal efficiencies simultaneously. The optimal pH, Fe2+ concentration, molar ratio of H2O2/Fe2+ and reaction time were found to be 3.3, 19.05 mM, 20.16 and 2.2 h, respectively, and 91.78% AOX and 75.01% TOC were removed under these conditions, which was validated. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC MS) results revealed that 28 out of 33 kinds of organic compounds, including 11 kinds of AOX were completely removed by the Fenton process while one new AOX compound, 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorophthalide, was produced which was the result of the carbonyl of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-1,3-isobenzofurandione being attacked in the Fenton reaction. These results indicated that analysis of organics was important since new AOX compounds could be produced in Fenton process despite the value of AOX decreasing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to propose a municipal wastewater treatment method based on solar Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) permitting reuse of the treated wastewater. Experiments were performed in a pilot compound parabolic collector (CPC) solar plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria. Mineralisation was monitored by measuring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the concentration profile of each compound during degradation was determined by HPLC-UV. Two different approaches, photo-Fenton (pH = 2.8) and TiO2 were tested with 9 different emerging contaminants at 100 mu g L-1 each (acetaminophen, antipyrine, atrazine, caffeine, diclofenac, isoproturon, progesterone, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan) at low iron and TiO2 concentrations. Photo-Fenton was by far more effective than TiO2 for degrading these contaminants, and was therefore selected for further study. The 9 contaminants were tested under the following conditions without pH adjustment: (i) Fe = 5 mg L-1, D.I. water; (ii) Fe = 5,15 and 55 mg L-1, standard fresh water; (iii) Fe = 5 mg L-1, standard fresh water without NaHCO3. Initial amount of hydrogen peroxide was 50 mg L-1, frequently analysed and added to maintain this concentration. it was demonstrated that low efficiency in some cases is mainly due to bicarbonates, and it is therefore proposed that the process be improved, either by increasing the iron concentration, or eliminating bicarbonates.

AB Concerns about cytostatic anticancer drugs in the environment are increasing, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the fate and impact of these cytotoxic compounds in the water cycle. In this context, the present work investigated the occurrence of 13 cytostatics and 4 metabolites in wastewater samples from various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from a large hospital from Spain. The target compounds belong to five different classes according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC), namely, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, plant alkaloids and other natural products, cytotoxic antibiotics and related substances, and other antineoplastic agents. Some of them have been classified as carcinogens in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). These compounds were determined by an automated on line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method. Results showed the presence of methotrexate (MET), ifosfamide (IF), cyclophosphamide (CP), irinotecan (IRI), doxorubicin (DOX), capecitabine (CAP), tamoxifen (TAM) and the metabolites endoxifen (OH-D-TAM), hydroxytamoxifen (OH-TAM) and hydroxypaclitaxel (OH-PAC) at levels ranging from 2 ng L-1 (for MET) to 180 ng L-1 (for TAM). Some of these compounds were found to be efficiently removed after wastewater treatment, e.g. MET, DOX and IRI, whereas other compounds, such as TAM, CP and IF remained largely unaltered. The behaviour of the target compounds during the common filtration step of the water samples was also investigated with the finding that some compounds are strongly adsorbed to nylon filters, while cellulose acetate appears as the best choice for the filter material. The aquatic environmental risk associated to the detected compounds was also assessed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of the metabolites OH-D-TAM and OH-TAM in the water cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) and diclofenac (DCF) are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals. They are frequently detected in wastewater and in the environment. Due to their harmful effect on aquatic organisms, new methods should be developed to enhance their removal from wastewater. One efficient wastewater treatment process is ozonation. In this study the fate of IBU and DCF during ozonation was investigated. Transformation products were identified with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (MS) and a quadrupole time-of-flight MS. Also, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry was used in order to investigate the presence of more volatile transformation products than those detected with LC-MS. Ten different products could be identified for IBU, including four isomers of hydroxylated IBU. Six were conclusively identified with authentic standards. For DCF, 14 different products could be identified of which four were isomers of hydroxylated DCF. Three products were identified with authentic standards. IBU, DCF and the major ozonation products were quantified with LC coupled to a triple quadrupole MS. Both IBU and DCF can be efficiently be transformed via ozonation. Only 20% of IBU is left after 30 min, while 10 min is required to transform DCF to the same extent. The major product formed during the ozonation of IBU was IBU with an additional ketone group, while the major product formed from DCF was 4MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-OH-DCF.

AB New technologies to address the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater are needed, especially in those cases in which water will be reused. In this work, the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) with simulated solar radiation has been applied to the oxidation of a mixture of six PPCPs, i.e. caffeine, primidone, N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), methylparaben, clofibric acid and ibuprofen. The sole application of solar radiation, i.e. solar photolysis, only led to the oxidation of clofibric acid (complete degradation in 90 min). The combination of PMS and solar radiation resulted in the degradation of all target micropollutants. The complete degradation of this mixture at initial 100 ppb was achieved with 0.5 mM of initial PMS after 90 min. A kinetic study that acceptably simulates the experimental data under different conditions has been proposed. The effects of initial PPCP concentration (1 mg L-1-100 mu g L-1), PMS dose (0.1 - 5 mM), and pH (3-9) were tested and kinetically simulated. Finally, the PPCPs removal study was carried out in two real water matrices (river and a secondary effluent of an urban wastewater treatment plant). A higher dose of PMS, ten times higher, was required to achieve complete degradation of the micropollutants if compared to ultrapure water.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are not monitored nor regulated consistently, but may have negative effects on human health and ecosystem balance. Although pharmaceuticals and personal care products are among the main ECs found in surface and wastewater, their toxicity and fate are currently not sufficiently studied. In this study, we analyzed for the first time a group of 46 ECs in the secondary effluent of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) of Prague. Thirty-seven compounds were identified in the discharge to surface water. Three compounds had no toxicology information on Artemia salina: furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and tramadol. We performed acute toxicity (LC50) tests and enzyme assays after 24 and 48 h at room temperature and 28 degrees C for these three compounds. LC50 ranged from 225.01 mg/L for furosemide, the most toxic, up to above 14,000 mg/L for tramadol. Changes in enzymatic activity for GST, GPx, AChE, and LDH when A. salina were exposed to LC25 for each contaminant were conspicuous and significant in a contaminant-, exposure time-, and temperature-dependent manner. These biochemical markers complement the toxicity profile of these contaminants in aquatic ecosystems and highlight the need for further research on other ECs and their implications, and the regulations required to protect human and ecological health.

AB The performance of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was investigated in the treatment of diluted pharmaceutical fermentation wastewater for a continuous operation of 140 days. The dynamics and compositions of the microbial community were monitored using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Increase of the organic loading rate (OLR) from 2.7 kg COD/m(3) d to 7.2 COD/m(3) d led to an increase in the COD removal efficiency from 83% to 91%. The dominant bacteria shifted from Proteobacteria (23.8%), Chloraflexi (14.5%) and Firmicutes (4.0%) to Firmicutes (48.4%), Bacteroidetes (9.5%) and Proteobacteria (5.4%). For archeaon, the dominant groups changed from Thermoplasmata (24.4%), Thermoprotei (18.0%) and Methanobacteria (30.8%) to Thermoplasmata (70.4%) and Methanomicrobia (16.8%). Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Thermoplasmata and Methanobacteria could outcompete other species and dominated in the reactor under higher OLR. The results indicated that, to some extent, microbial community shift could reflect the performance of the reactor and a significant community shift corresponded to a considerable process event.

AB Kinetics of pure compounds in batch agitated reactors are useful data to clarify the characteristics of a given reaction, but they frequently do not provide the required information to design industrial mixed continuous processes because in this case the final and intermediate products interact with the reaction of interest, due to backmixing effects. Simultaneously, the presence and transformations of other compounds, frequent in industrial wastewater treatments, adds more complexity to these types of interactions, whose effect can be different, favorable or unfavorable, for chemical or biological reactions. In this work, batch laboratory reactor data were obtained for the wet oxidation and biodegradation of four phenolic compounds present in a pharmaceutical wastewater and then compared with those collected from industrial continuous stirred tank reactors. For wet oxidation, batch laboratory degradation rates were significantly lower than those found in industrial continuous stirred operation. This behavior was explained by a different distribution of intermediate compounds in lab and industrial treatments, caused by the degree of backmixing and the synergistic effects between phenolic compounds (matrix effects). On the other hand, the specific utilization rates during aerobic biodegradation in the continuous industrial operation were lower than those measured in the laboratory, due to the simultaneous presence of the four pollutants in the industrial process (matrix effects) increasing the inhibitory effects of these compounds and its intermediates.

AB In this work, a real wastewater (deriving from the chemical-pharmaceutical field) was treated by means of H2O2/UV process under different conditions in a pilot-scale plant. Several methods were used in order to assess the oxidation efficiency and to understand the main reaction features. It was shown that nonconventional COD measurement (with a 75degreesC digestion of the sample) is helpful for understanding reaction mechanisms, when integrated with TOC and COD analyses and GC-MS determinations. For the biodegradability study, beside BOD (5 and 20 days) measurements, OUR and AUR tests provide additional information especially when wastewater is tested by taking the activated sludge from the treatment plant which should really be fed with it. Finally, dehydrogenase activity measurements can show the presence of complex organic matter, which may be degraded only by an acclimated biomass.

AB Aromatic amines are one of the most important classes of compounds contributing to surface water mutagenicity due to their widespread occurrence as precursors and transformation products of dyes, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other compound classes. In this study, we implemented a workflow including novel analytical and data evaluation methods aiming to identify aromatic amines in six mutagenic wastewater effluents from a chemical-industrial area in Germany, collected by the passive sampler Blue Rayon. We identified 14 amines including the two potent mutagenic aromatic amines 2,3- and 2,8-phenazinediamine,. which were reported for the first time as environmental contaminants. These two isomers accounted between 4.2 and 86% of the mutagenicity of the blue rayon extracts and may be byproducts of dye production at the studied site.

AB Pharmaceutical drugs' removal from wastewater by photocatalytic oxidation process is considered as an attractive approach and environmentally friendly solution. This report aims to appraise the practical application potential of Ag/g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods toward the wastewater treatment of the pharmaceutical industry. The catalysts are synthesized by straightforward and environmentally-friendly strategies. Specifically, g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods heterostructure is constructed by a simple self-assembly method, and then Ag nanoparticles are decorated on g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods by a photoreduction route. The results show that three commercial drugs (paracetamol, amoxicillin, and cefalexin) with high concentration (40 mg L-1) are significantly degraded in the existence of a small dosage of Ag/g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods (0.08 g L-1). The Ag/g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods photocatalyst exhibits degradation performance of paracetamol higher 3.8, 1.8, 1.3 times than pristine g-C3N4, ZnO nanorods, and g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, Ag/g-C3N4/ZnO nanorods have an excellent reusability and a chemical stability that achieved paracetamol degradation efficiency of 78% and remained chemical structure of the photocatalyst after five cycles. In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism explanation and comparison of photocatalytic drugs' degradation ability have also been discussed in this study.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of solar and UV-A photocatalysis with suspended TiO2 to degrade ibuprofen and carbamazepine in aqueous matrices. Emphasis was given on the effect of various operating conditions such as catalyst type (six commercially available titanium oxide samples were tested) and concentration (50-3000 mg/L), initial drug concentration (5-20 mg/L), solution pH (3-10), the addition of hydrogen peroxide (0.07-1.4 mM), and the matrix (pure water and treated domestic wastewater) on degradation and mineralization. The former was assessed monitoring sample absorbance at each drug's characteristic wavelength, while the latter measuring dissolved organic carbon. The best performance was achieved at lower drug concentrations irradiated by UV-A in the presence of Degussa P25 catalyst and hydrogen peroxide in pure water.

AB Influent-effluent monitoring by comprehensive chemical analyses was conducted at the Avedoere wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) during 2002. In one programme, the same samples were tested for algal toxicity by the ISO 8692 method. Based on evaluation of 17 hazardous substances (including 7 heavy metals), there was a quite good agreement between calculated and measured toxic units. In another programme, influent - effluent monitoring for 11 pharmaceuticals and specific hormones showed high removal rates, except for sulphamethizol and furosemide. High removal is probably due to WWTP operation with long SRTs. Effluent biomonitoring of freshwater mussels showed only bioaccumulation for: diethylphthalate, LAS, EOX as well as Cr and Ni. Surprisingly, no bioaccumulation could be observed for 100 other specific organic compounds and 8 other heavy metals (including Hg, Cd and Pb).

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of pelletized iron-modified diatomite as heterogeneous Fenton catalyst for the removal of carbamazepine, clindamycin, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, florfenicol, and sulfamethazine, and to compare its performance in fixed and fluidized bed reactor configurations. The prepared catalyst pellets were characterized by XRD, SEM, ED-XRF, BET, and compression strength analysis. Applying a Taguchi L9 design of experiments, the oxidation of a mixture of six common pharmaceuticals was studied under different operating conditions (initial pH, particle size, space time, and H2O2 initial concentration) for both reactor configurations. Under the best operating conditions, overall pharmaceutical degradations by the Fenton reaction were 32.6 % and 31.8 % in the fluidized and fixed bed reactors, respectively. Among the analyzed pharmaceuticals, clindamycin was the one presenting the highest removal (88.8 % fixed, 89.7 % fluidized), followed by gemfibrozil (70.4 % fixed, 100 % fluidized), ketoprofen (36.2 % fixed, 35.1 % fluidized), carbamazepine (19.0 % fixed, 21.1 % fluidized), sulfamethazine (18.1 % fixed, 21.1 % fluidized), and florfenicol (4.6 % fixed, 7.0 % fluidized). The initial pH was the most sensitive variable, presenting the best performance at pH 3. After 10 h of operation, the catalyst suffered a 27.9 % decrease in its activity when operated in the fixed bed reactor, whereas in the fluidized bed reactor its deactivation was 52.1 %. The catalyst was also evaluated in a real wastewater matrix, showing basically the same activity as in synthetic wastewater; TOC overall removal was 31 % for the fixed bed and 36 % for the fluidized bed reactor. Finally, the electrical energy per order (EEO) consumed in both reactors was calculated to compare their energy efficiency; the fixed bed configuration presented the lowest value (1.01 Wh/m(3)/order), suggesting that this is a more energy-efficient configuration for commercial wastewater treatment applications.

AB Reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) resulting from the municipal wastewater recycling processes poses significant environmental and health risks as it contains significant concentrations of harmful compounds, including phenolic chemicals including bisphenol A (BPA). In this study, the effect of ferrate(VI) (or Fe(VI)) oxidation on the degradation of BPA (50 mu g L-1) in a typical ROC matrix was investigated. The influence of process variables including the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratios (7-50), initial pH (5.0-8.0) and reaction temperature (15-25 degrees C) was studied. Fe(VI) was found to be highly effective in degrading BPA in the complex ROC matrix with various operating conditions. At 25 degrees C, over 90% degradation of BPA was achieved at the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and an initial pH of the ROC at 8.0 after 90 min of reaction. Under such conditions, the reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was found to be 34% accompanied by a 95% reduction in UV254 absorbance (initial value 0.750 cm(-1)) with 96.4% SUVA reduction. Additionally, the residual concentration of Fe(III) at pH 8.0 was the lowest compared to other pH conditions at a fixed [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50. Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analyses revealed that Fe(VI) preferentially react with fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like compounds, and aromatic protein II in the ROC. This indicated Fe(VI) effectively breaking down electron-rich moieties groups including phenols and other organics in ROC. The apparent second-order rate constant (k(app)) for BPA degradation was determined to be 2.27 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1) at pH 8.0 at a [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and the value of reaction rate constant increased proportionally with increasing molar ratio at the range studied. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) in the degradation of BPA in the ROC demonstrates the potential of using Fe(VI) as an efficient oxidant to remediate the micropollutants present in water and wastewater.

AB The release of toxic contaminant of emerging concern from urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) into the environment calls for more effective (tertiary) treatment methods. In this manuscript, homogeneous solar-driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), namely H2O2/sunlight, solar photo-Fenton (Fe+2/H2O2/sunlight) and solar photo-Fenton with ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) complex (Fe+2/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight) were compared to a new heterogeneous process (supported nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2)/sunlight), with the aim of contributing to fill the gap between lab scale tests and full scale applications as well as to provide a sustainable solution for tertiary treatment in small UWTPs. Process efficiency was evaluated in terms of effluent toxicity and degradation of a mixture of three pharmaceuticals (namely carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac and trimethoprim), at initial concentration of 200 mu g/L each, in deionized water (DW) and real wastewater (WW). Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight was found to be the most effective process (98% removal of CBZ from WW in 60 min, 5.6 kJ/L as cumulative solar energy per unit of volume). Conventional solar photo Fenton was drastically and negatively affected by water matrix, due to the spontaneous neutral pH and iron precipitation in real WW. Although N-TiO2/sunlight process was not so affected by water matrix, it was found to be less efficient (30% removal of CBZ in 180 min, 13.3 kJ/L) than Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight process. Toxicity values were found to be lower in WW compared to DW matrix. Class weight scores for WW samples showed a toxicity reduction up to the no acute toxicity level for N-TiO2/sunlight and Fe2+/H2O2/EDDS/sunlight treatments, while H2O2/sunlight and Fe2+/H2O2/sunlight increased the final effluent toxicity up to slightly acute levels.

AB The concentration of eleven antibiotics (trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin), three decongestants (naphazoline, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) and the antiviral drug oseltamivir's active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), were measured weekly at 21 locations within the River Thames catchment in England during the month of November 2009, the autumnal peak of the influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 pandemic. The aim was to quantify the pharmaceutical response to the pandemic and compare this to drug use during the late pandemic (March 2010) and the inter-pandemic periods (May 2011). A large and small wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were sampled in November 2009 to understand the differential fate of the analytes in the two WWTPs prior to their entry in the receiving river and to estimate drug users using a wastewater epidemiology approach. Mean hourly OC concentrations in the small and large WWTP's influent were 208 and 350 ng/L (max, 2070 and 550 ng/L, respectively). Erythromycin was the most concentrated antibiotic measured in Benson and Oxford WWTPs influent (max = 6,870 and 2,930 ng/L, respectively). Napthazoline and oxymetazoline were the most frequently detected and concentrated decongestant in the Benson WWTP influent (1650 and 67 ng/L) and effluent (696 and 307 ng/L), respectively, but were below detection in the Oxford WWTP. OC was found in 73% of November 2009's weekly river samples (max = 193 ng/L), but only in 5% and 0% of the late-and inter-pandemic river samples, respectively. The mean river concentration of each antibiotic during the pandemic largely fell between 17-74 ng/L, with clarithromycin (max = 292 ng/L) and erythromycin (max = 448 ng/L) yielding the highest single measure. In general, the concentration and frequency of detecting antibiotics in the river increased during the pandemic. OC was uniquely well-suited for the wastewater epidemiology approach owing to its nature as a prodrug, recalcitrance and temporally-and spatially-resolved prescription statistics.

AB Three sampling campaigns were performed in the Lis River (Leiria, Portugal) in February of 2018, November of 2018, and May of 2019. River water and wastewater (influent and effluent) samples of two wastewater treatment plants were target of the study. A total of 25 samples were collected and 50 pesticides were monitored, including organochlorines, triazines, pyrethroids, and organophosphorus, among others. Most of the detected pesticides were insecticides and mainly organochlorines. Concentrations between 1.29 and 2134 ng/L were found. Aldrin, gamma-HCH, and cypermethrin were detected in some samples in mu g/L, being gamma-HCH the pesticide most frequently detected with concentration in mu g/L level. The pesticides with the highest detection frequency were (i) cypermethrin, HCB, methoxychlor, and zeta-HCH in river waters; (ii) isoproturon, cypermethrin, methoxychlor, pyrimethanil, gamma-HCH, dieldrin, diuron, alpha-HCH, and alpha-endosulfan in effluents; and (iii) diuron and isoproturon in influents. The detection of the organochlorides and their degradation products is a consequence of their persistence in the environment, as their usage has long been prohibited in the European Union. Pesticides were grouped by their types in herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides and the detection and concentration for each type were discussed with the climatic conditions. Pesticide toxicity index was determined in the samples collected in the river.

AB Combination of 'green' coagulation and powdered activated carbon adsorption was tested for removal of benzophenone (BP), benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and caffeine (CF) from treated municipal wastewater at realistic concentration levels (1-2 mu g/L). At the same time it was tracked how the process affected effluent organic matter (EfOM) by measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD). Green coagulant was produced from dry common bean seed in laboratory. Combined coagulation-adsorption experiments were performed by applying different dosing sequences of process materials. Removal of hydrophobic BP and BP-3 by separate adsorption (from 79 to 98%) was not significantly hindered by the addition of the coagulant (activated carbon dose of 5 or 20 mg/L). However, in some cases negative effects were observed for hydrophilic caffeine, depending on the carbon dose, dosing sequence and presence of total suspended solids (TSS). Thus, when coagulant was firstly added into water without TSS before low activated carbon dose of 5 mg/L, caffeine removal dropped from 26% to 5%. Conversely, when TSS were present in the water sample, the removal of caffeine was not hindered under the same PAC dose and dosing sequence. The importance of the process optimisation related to removal of organic micropollutans of different hydrophilicity has been shown in this paper. Removal of around 30% of COD regardless of the dosing sequence was achieved.

AB The variability of fecal microorganisms and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) loads in relation to influent flow rates was evaluated for a water resource recovery facility (WRRF) in support of a vulnerability assessment of a drinking water source. Incomplete treatment and bypass discharges often occur following intense precipitation events that represent conditions that deviate from normal operation. Parasites, fecal indicator bacteria, and WWMPs concentrations and flow rate were measured at the WRRF influent and effluent during dry and wet weather periods. Influent concentrations were measured to characterize potential bypass concentrations that occur during wet weather. Maximum influent Giardia and C. perfringens loads and maximum effluent Escherichia coli and C. perfringens loads were observed during wet weather. Influent median loads of Cryptosporidium and Giardia were 6.8 log oocysts/day and 7.9 log cysts/day per 1,000 people. Effluent median loads were 3.9 log oocysts/day and 6.3 log cysts/day per 1,000 people. High loads of microbial contaminants can occur during WRRF bypasses following wet weather and increase with increasing flow rates; thus, short-term infrequent events such as bypasses should be considered in vulnerability assessments of drinking water sources in addition to the increased effluent loads during normal operation following wet weather.

AB The release of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen (Ibu), Naproxen (Nab) and Diclofenac (Dic) to the aquatic system cause serious environmental problems. In this study, green-synthesized copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have been used as nano-adsorbent for the removal of Ibu, Nab, and Dic from wastewater samples. Formation of Cu NPs was confirmed by different analytical techniques. The adsorption parameters such as temperature, pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and contact time were studied. The best removal results were obtained at these conditions: temperature 298 K, pH = 4.5, 10.0 mg Cu NPs, 60 min. At these conditions, the removal percentage of Ibu, Nap, and Dic were found to be 74.4, 86.9 and 91.4% respectively. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacities were calculated as 36.0, 33.9 and 33.9 mg/g for Dic, Nap, and Ibu respectively. The kinetic studies conducted that the sorption process obeyed the second order kinetic model, while the thermodynamic results revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous, endothermic (+23.8, +40.8 and +38.3 kJ/mol for Ibu, Nap and Dic respectively). The results revealed that green-synthesized copper nano-adsorbent may be used for the removal of the anti-inflammatory drugs from real wastewater efficiently.

AB This study examined the impact of tetracycline at two environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L) and one synthetically high concentration (500 mu g/L) on the structure and function of the microbial community from the secondary treatment process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Specifically, this study examined whether the introduction of tetracycline into bench scale reactors at two different replacement volume rates would cause a shift in the composition profile of the bacterial community. Furthermore concentrations of ammonia, nitrate/nitrite and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were monitored to examine the effect of the antibiotic on ammonia and nitrogen removal. At the low volume replacement rate, tetracycline was observed to have a positive impact on nitrogen removal. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations were also observed to decrease suggesting a role for tetracycline as a carbon source. However, at the higher volume replacement rate, the removal of ammonia and nitrogen were not significantly different from reactors that did not contain tetracycline. Over time, the bacterial composition profiles changed under all the conditions studied, however, the bacterial composition profiles appeared to be more influenced by the replacement volume rate than the presence of tetracycline even at concentrations many times higher than environmentally relevant amounts.

AB Removal of emerging contaminants in wastewater treatment is essential to ensure the ecological health of the receiving water bodies. Ozonation is a promising technology to achieve this purpose but important wastewater characteristics affecting the optimal removal efficiency need to be elucidated. Secondary effluents contain effluent organic matter (EfOM), which can react directly with ozone as well as react as the initiator, promoter and inhibitor in the hydroxyl radical (.OH) chain reactions resulting from ozone decomposition. These different reaction modes of EfOM, coupled with alkalinity and pH value, collectively determine the ozone and .OH exposures and the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds by ozonation. In this study, we determined the rate constants of EfOM collected from two municipal wastewater treatment plants in terms of direct ozone reaction, initiation, promotion and inhibition at various pH values (pH 6.0-7.5) and temperatures (10-30 degrees C). The rate constants of direct reaction and initiation generally increased with the increasing pH value while the rate constants of promotion and inhibition did not vary significantly. All rate constants increased with the increasing temperature. The removal of ibuprofen, acetylsulfamethoxazole and metoprolol in diluted secondary effluent by ozonation can be fairly-well modeled by using the determined rate constants of EfOM.

AB Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are more efficient than non-nitrifying WWTPs to remove several micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This may be related to the activity of nitrifying organisms, such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOBs), which could possibly co-metabolically oxidize micropollutants with their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). The role of AOBs in micropollutant removal was investigated with aerobic granular sludge (AGS), a promising technology for municipal WWTPs. Two identical laboratory-scale AGS sequencing batch reactors (AGS-SBRs) were operated with or without nitrification (inhibition of AMOs) to assess their potential for micropollutant removal. Of the 36 micropollutants studied at 1 mu g l(-1) in synthetic wastewater, nine were over 80% removed, but 17 were eliminated by less than 20%. Five substances (bisphenol A, naproxen, irgarol, terbutryn and iohexol) were removed better in the reactor with nitrification, probably due to co-oxidation catalysed by AMOs. However, for the removal of all other micropollutants, AOBs did not seem to play a significant role. Many compounds were better removed in aerobic condition, suggesting that aerobic heterotrophic organisms were involved in the degradation. As the AGS-SBRs did not favour the growth of such organisms, their potential for micropollutant removal appeared to be lower than that of conventional nitrifying WWTPs.

AB Avermectin fermentation wastewater (AFW) is a highly toxic effluent generated in the pharmaceutical industry and is typically treated by using of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. This study aims to further optimize the overall treatment process to meet discharge standards and water quality for reuse. After the UASB reactor, the pretreated AFW undergoes Fenton oxidation, which improves the biodegradability of the UASB effluent and the removal of COD and ammonia in subsequent biotreatment processes. Optimal operating conditions for Fenton oxidation (pH = 3.5, H2O2 = 4 ml/l, FeSO4. 7H(2)O = 1.1 g/l) and anoxic-oxic-membrane bioreactor (AO-MBR) system (HRT = 72 h, reflux ratio = 300%) show an average removal rate of 84.3%, 79.4%, and 72.3% for COD, ammonia, and TN, respectively, which could be further treated by nanofiltration or reverse osmosis (NF/RO). Toxicity of the effluent was also significantly reduced. For a high-flux MBR system, HCl + NaClO was found to provide the best treatment for increasing the acceptable transmembrane pressure (TMP) caused by cake layer accumulation and fouling by inorganic metal ions. Study results demonstrate the potential of Fenton-AO/MBR process as a post-UASB reactor treatment and a pre-treatment of NF/RO, improving biodegradability, pollutant removal, and toxicity reduction of AFW.

AB Cefdinir adsorption onto non-activated biochar (WL-BC) and activated biochars (WL-BC-H, WL-BC-OH) prepared from waste biomass (WL) is comparatively investigated in view of adsorption factors, adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics. Batch experiments are conducted to assess the effects of pH, adsorption time and initial antibiotic concentration. Various advanced techniques are applied to characterize the prepared biochars (BCs). Characterization of the new BCs reveal that the activation process do not have a significant effect on the chemical structure of activated carbons, but it increases the surface area up to eight times. The equilibrium data are simulated with the Langmuir adsorption model indicating monolayer adsorption for both activated biochars WL-BC and WL-BC-H. However, the adsorption isotherm for WL-BC-OH is represented well by the Freundlich model, which shows that multilayer adsorption took place. The kinetic data are analyzed using various kinetic models. The maximum adsorption capacity of the activated biochar is approximately tenfold in comparison to the non-activated biochar. Additionally, the real wastewater experiments with treated campus wastewater show that the adsorptive performance of the activated biochar is not affected by other ions. Consequently, BCs derived from defatted laurel leaves could be effective and eco-friendly adsorbents for removing cefdinir from wastewater.

TI Assessment of emerging polar organic pollutants linked to contaminant
   pathways within an urban estuary using non-targeted analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
LA English
DT Article
AB A comprehensive, non-targeted analysis of polar organic pollutants using high resolution/accurate mass (HR/AM) mass spectrometry approaches has been applied to water samples from San Francisco (SF) Bay, a major urban estuary on the western coast of the United States, to assess occurrence of emerging contaminants and inform future monitoring and management activities. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were deployed selectively to evaluate the influence of three contaminant pathways: urban stormwater runoff (San Leandro Bay), wastewater effluent (Coyote Creek, Lower South Bay), and agricultural runoff (Napa River). Grab samples were collected before and after deployment of the passive samplers to provide a quantitative snapshot of contaminants for comparison. Composite samples of wastewater effluent (24 hours) were also collected from several wastewater dischargers. Samples were analyzed using liquid-chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. Resulting data were analyzed using a customized workflow designed for high-fidelity detection, prioritization, identification, and semi-quantitation of detected molecular features. Approximately 6350 compounds were detected in the combined data set, with 424 of those compounds tentatively identified through high quality spectral library match scores. Compounds identified included ethoxylated surfactants, pesticide and pharmaceutical transformation products, polymer additives, and rubber vulcanization agents. Compounds identified in samples were reflective of the apparent sources and pathways of organic pollutant inputs, with stormwater-influenced samples dominated by additive chemicals likely derived from plastics and vehicle tires, as well as ethoxylated surfactants.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU), a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is widely used by humans for controlling fever and pain, and is frequently detected in the influent of wastewater treatment plants and different aquatic environments. In this study, the biotransformation of IBU in activated sludge (AS), anaerobic methanogenic sludge (AnMS) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)-enriched sludge systems was investigated at three different concentrations of 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/L via a series of batch and continuous studies. IBU at concentration of 100 mu g/L was effectively biodegraded by AS whereas AnMS and SRB-enriched sludge were less effective in IBU biodegradation at all concentrations tested. However, at higher IBU concentrations of 500 and 1000 mu g/L, AS showed poor IBU biodegradation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal due to inhibition of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (i.e., Candidatus Competibacter) by IBU and/or IBU biotransformation products. The microbial analyses showed that IBU addition shifted the microbial community structure in AS, AnMS and SRB-enriched sludge systems, however, the removals of COD, nitrogen and sulfur in both anaerobic sludge systems were not affected significantly (p> 0.05). The findings of this study provided a new insight into biotransformation of IBU in three important biological sludge systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural and synthetic estrogens have been widely detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent as well as in the corresponding receiving aqueous environment and other ecosystems. Microalgae can be used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater, but the species-dependent removal of estrogens needs further investigation. In this study we investigated estrone, 17 beta-estradiol and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol removals and transformation products by four common microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, Selenastrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus quadricauda, and Chlorella vulgaris. It was found that H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum and S. quadricauda could more effectively remove all three estrogens in synthetic wastewater effluent. The estrogenic activities i.e. 1713-estradiol equivalency determined by yeast estrogenic screening assay showed substantial estrogenic activity reductions after biotransformation by H. pluvialis, S. capricornutum, and S. quadricauda. Quadrupole Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry results identified several possible ring-cleavage metabolites as well as their metabolic pathways, which had not been reported yet, confirming the estrogen degradation rather than mere absorption or uptake by microalgae. The findings demonstrate that not only can some specific bacteria degrade estrogens, but also the widely living microalgae are able to degrade these emerging pollutants, suggesting that microalgae could be an advanced treatment of WWTPs to remove nutrients and estrogens.

AB The occurrence, eliminations, enantiomeric distribution and intra-day variations of five chiral pharmaceuticals (three beta-blockers and two antidepressants) were investigated in eight major WWTPs in Beijing, China. The results revealed that metoprolol (MTP) and venlafaxine (VFX) were of the highest concentrations among the five determined pharmaceuticals with mean concentrations of 803 ng L-1 and 408 ng L-1, respectively in influents, and 354 ng L-1 and 165 ng L-1 in effluents, respectively. Their removal efficiencies, intra-day concentration changes and enantiomeric profiles during wastewater treatment were further analyzed. Loads of these two chiral pharmaceuticals were also studied to reveal drug use pattern. A/A/O+MBR (anaerobicianoxicioxic + membrane bio-reactor) followed by joint disinfection treatment process exhibited the high removal efficiencies. No or weak enantioselectivity was observed in most WWTPs. However, obvious enantiomeric fraction (EF) changing of MTP was observed in WWTP3 employing A/A/O+MBR. Intra-day concentration fluctuations of MTP were smaller than VFX. A quick response to sudden rise influent concentration of MTP was observed in WWTP1 effluent but EF response lagged behind. Similar bihourly EF variations in influents and effluents were also observed in most WWTPs for MTP and VFX in consideration of hydraulic residence time (HRT). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eight pharmaceuticals, the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, two antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin, and five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ketorolac, and ketoprofen were analyzed in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants in Jordan. After solid phase extraction at pH 4, the analytes were determined by LC-MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring mode. For quantitation purposes, external calibration was applied first. Regression coefficients of >= 0.995 indicated the linearity in the concentration range of 0.5-100 ng/mu L. Finally, single-point standard addition was applied to compensate matrix effects. The instrumental detection limits were between 0.05 and 20 pg amount injected. The method quantitation limits for spiked influent and effluent samples were 0.5 and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively. Recovery rates were >= 78%. Precision given as relative standard deviations for within-day precision and time-different intermediate precision ranged from 2 to 21 and 1 to 19%, respectively. In this study, the maximum average concentrations found for ibuprofen were 5.7 mu g/L in the influent and 2.2 mu g/L in the effluent samples. The other pharmaceuticals ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 and 0.2 to 1.3 mu g/L, respectively. Ketorolac and ketoprofen were not detected.

AB This work studies the degradation of seven representative antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, cefalexin, and cefadroxil) by solar photo-Fenton process. The removal of antibiotics by the individual components (i.e., light, H2O2, or Fe (II)) and the complete photochemical system (light/H2O2/Fe (II)) was initially evaluated. Then, the effect of citric acid addition to the photo-Fenton system was assessed. In the third place, the primary transformation products for two illustrative cases (ciprofloxacin and oxacillin treated by photo-Fenton) were determined. Also, photo-Fenton in the presence of citric acid was applied to remove antibiotics from a simulated hospital wastewater. It was found that the solar light component induced degradation of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and levofloxacin, but the rest of the considered antibiotics were not reduced by photolysis. In turn, the photo-Fenton system showed a degrading action on all the tested antibiotics. The addition of citric acid to the system significantly increased the removal of antibiotics. Initial degradation products indicated that hydroxyl radical attacked moieties of antibiotics responsible for their antimicrobial activity. Finally, the treatment of hospital wastewater evidenced the high potentiality of photo-Fenton process for degrading antibiotics in aqueous matrices containing elevated concentrations of citric acid.

AB New emerging contaminants are being released into the environment. Some of these are not removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate a pilot-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) as a technology applicable to the removal of emerging pollutants. The work focused on two pharmaceutical compounds in particular (carbamazepine and sildenafil citrate) and a personal care product (methylparaben). The behavior of the system was evaluated for the individual addition and mixture of the three compounds, using organic loads similar to those of secondary and tertiary treatment effluent. The working flow rate was 70mL/min, and the concentration of the compounds was 200g/L. The organic load was evaluated at different times. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity and pH were measured in situ on each sampling. Removal efficiencies greater than 98% were achieved for methylparaben, but less than 20% for pharmaceuticals. The average removal efficiency was 95% for the organic matter in the different tests. In this investigation, it was observed that the RBC allowed the effective removal of emerging contaminants which have flat molecular geometry and essential chemical elements, such as methylparaben. However, its effectiveness was poor in removing contaminants formed from more complex structures such as carbamazepine and sildenafil citrate. The operational stability of the system was not affected when these compounds were incorporated in amounts similar to those found in wastewater.

AB Thiosulfate is generated from various process industries, such as petrochemical, metallurgical, photography processing, pharmaceutical, pigment and dye manufacturing units, etc. Thiosulfate-bearing wastewater is also produced during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater. In the present work, oxidative removal of thiosulfate in the presence of UV light from aqueous solution has been investigated. The effect of thiosulfate concentration, oxygen partial pressure, UV light intensity and air flow rate on the kinetics of thiosulfate removal has been explored, and suitable rate equations were developed for the oxidation processes. 67 % of thiosulfate was removed from the aqueous solution by carrying out aerial oxidation for one hour. Using photooxidation by UV light, 1,200ppm thiosulfate could be oxidized by one hour. Overall reaction by aerial oxidation followed the second-order kinetics, whereas by photooxidation, it followed third-order kinetics.

AB The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a serious pandemic with millions of cases diagnosed worldwide. To fight COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 countries instituted either a full or partial lockdown, affecting billions of people. In Tyrol, first lockdown measures were taken on 10 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, a curfew went into force which ended on 1 May 2020. On 19 March 2020. Tyrol as a whole was placed in quarantine which ended on 7 April 2020. The governmental actions helped reducing the spread of COVID-19 at the cost of significant effects on social life and behaviour. Accordingly, to provide a comprehensive picture of the population health status not only input from medical and biological sciences is required, but also from other sciences able to provide lifestyle information such as drug use. Herein, wastewater-based epidemiology was used for studying temporal bends of licit and illicit drug consumption during lockdown and quarantine in the area of the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck (174,000 inhabitants). On 35 days between 12 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, loads of 23 markers were monitored in wastewater. Loads determined on 292 days between March 2016 and January 2020 served as reference. During lockdown, changes in the consumption patterns of recreational drugs (i.e. cocaine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, and alcohol) and pharmaceuticals for short-term application (i.e. acetaminophen. codeine, and trimethoprim) were detected. For illicit drugs and alcohol, it is very likely that observed changes were linked to the shutdown of the hospitality industry and event cancelation which led to a reduced demand of these compounds particularly on weekends. For the pharmaceuticals, further work will be necessary to darify if the observed declines are indicators of improved population health or of some kind of restraining effect that reduced the number of consultations of medical doctors and pharmacies.

AB Ozonation of secondary wastewater treatment plant effluent for the abatement of organic micropollutants requires an accurate process control, which can be based on monitoring ozone-induced changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM). This study presents a novel automated analytical system for monitoring changes in the electron donating capacity (EDC) and UV absorbance of DOM during ozonation. In a first step, a quantitative photometric EDC assay was developed based on electron-transfer reactions from phenolic moieties in DOM to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS(center dot+)). The assay is highly sensitive (limit of quantification similar to 0.5 mg(DOC.)L(-1)) and EDC values of model DOM isolates determined by this assay were in good agreement with values determined previously by mediated electrochemical oxidation (slope = 1.01 +/- 0.07, R-2 = 0.98). In a second step, the photometric EDC measurement method was transferred onto an automated fluidic system coupled to a photometer (EDC analyzer). The EDC analyzer was then used to monitor changes in EDC and UV absorbance of secondary wastewater effluent treated with ozone. While both parameters exhibited a dose-dependent decrease, a more pronounced decrease in EDC as compared to UV absorbance was observed at specific ozone doses up to 0.4 mg(O3)center dot g(DOC)(-1). The concentration of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, a phenolic micropollutant with a high ozone reactivity, decreased proportionally to the EDC decrease. In contrast, abatement of less ozone-reactive micropollutants and bromate formation started only after a pronounced initial decrease in EDC. The on-line EDC analyzer presented herein will enable a comprehensive assessment of the combination of EDC and UV absorbance as control parameters for full-scale ozonation. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in wastewaters are well-established factors that contribute to the reduced potency of antibiotics used in healthcare worldwide. The human health risk associated with the proliferation of ARB and ARGs need to be understood in order to design mitigation measures to combat their dissemination. Using the PCR analysis of genomic DNA, the prevalence of 41 ARGs active against the commonly used six classes of antibiotics was evaluated in 60 bacterial isolates obtained from pharmaceutical wastewaters in Nigeria. The ARGs most frequently detected from the bacterial isolates in each of the antibiotic classes under study include catA1 (58.3%); sulI (31.7%); tet(E) (30%); aac(3)-IV (28.3%); ermC (20%); bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(NDM-1) at 18.3% each; which encode for resistance to chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and beta-lactams and penicillins, respectively. Acinetobacter spp., accession number MH396735 expressed the highest number of ARGs of all the bacterial isolates, having at least one gene that encodes for resistance to all the classes of antibiotics in the study. This study highlights wide distribution of ARB and ARGs to the antibiotics tested in the wastewater, making pharmaceutical wastewater reservoirs of ARGs which could potentially be transferred from commensal microorganisms to human pathogens.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. Many pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during wastewater treatment, leading to their presence in wastewater treatment effluents, rivers, lakes, and ground water. Here, we developed analytical methods for monitoring ten pharmaceuticals from surface water by LC/ESI-MS/MS. For sample clean-up and extraction, MCX (mixed cation exchange) and HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were used. The limits of detection (LOD) in distilled water and the blank surface water were in the range of 0.006 - 0.65 and 1.66 - 45.05 pg/mL, respectively. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) for the distilled water and the blank surface water were in the range of 0.02 - 2.17 and 5.52 - 150.15 pg/mL, respectively. The absolute recoveries for fortified water samples were between 62.1% and 125.4%. Intra-day precision and accuracy for the blank surface water were 2.9% - 24.1% (R.S.D.) and -16.3% - 16.3% (bias), respectively. In surface wastewater near rivers, chlortetracycline and acetylsalicylic acid were detected frequently in the range of 0.017 - 5.404 and 0.029 - 0.269 ng/mL, respectively. Surface water near rivers had higher levels than surface water of domestic treatment plants.

AB Parabens are widely used in food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products because they are excellent preservatives. Recently, the environmental fate of parabens has attracted attention owing to their similarity to some endocrine disrupters. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are both important sinks of parabens discharged from our daily activities and key pollution sources for the environment if the parabens are not completely removed. However, research in this area is scarce, especially in Asia. In this study, 6 commonly used parabens and 4 metabolites were analyzed in wastewater and sludge samples from two typical WWTPs with different treatment processes (the anaerobic-oxic (A/O) and cyclic activated sludge technology (CAST) treatment processes). The average concentrations of parabens in the A/O and CAST treatment processes were 1510 ng/L and 2180 ng/L, respectively, in the influent, and 70.5 ng/L and 19.7 ng/L, respectively, in the effluent. The paraben removal efficiencies in the A/O treatment process were between 56.8% and 100%, which is lower than the efficiencies for the CAST treatment process (97.7% to 100%). The average concentrations of metabolites in the A/O treatment process, which were much higher than paraben concentrations, were 35,200 ng/L in the influent, 334 ng/L in the effluent, and 146 ng/g in the sludge samples. The removal efficiencies for the 4 metabolites were >92% for the A/O treatment process. In total, for the A/O treatment process, 5.07 kg and 16.8 kg of parabens, and 24.4 kg and 16.0 kg of metabolites, were discharged into the environment annually via effluent and sludge, respectively. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the A/O and CAST treatment processes are both effective at removing parabens and their metabolites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we aim to assess the occurrence and impact of UV-Fs and benzotriazoles in aquatic ecosystems in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. River water samples from the Llobregat and Besos Rivers were analysed together with sediment, suspended particulate matter, and wastewater samples from 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along their basins. The analysis of 6 UV-Fs and 2 benzotriazoles in water samples was performed using an automatized on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) method. The analysis of the target compounds in the suspended solids and in the sediments was performed by HPLC-MS/MS. The analysis of the water samples showed the ubiquitous presence of UV-Fs. Benzotriazole (BZT; partition coefficient octanol-water Log K-ow = 1.23) and methylbenzotriazole (MeBZT; Log K-ow = 1.89) had the highest levels in both river water and wastewater. Removal rates in the selected WWTPs were highly variable (4-100%). Concentrations of lipophilic UV-Fs (Log K-ow 4.95-7.53) in suspended particulate matter from wastewaters were high (up to 1,031,868.2 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw)), whereas in sediment the concentrations were always below 300 ng g(-1) dw. The risk assessment expressed in terms of hazard quotients (HQs) revealed that most UV-Fs were not likely to produce adverse ecotoxicological effects against the living organisms assayed in river waters and influent wastewaters at the concentrations observed. However, HQs above 1 were obtained for BZT and MeBZT in effluent wastewaters discharged to the river. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrous ferric oxide (HFO)-impregnated agarose beads were prepared as an adsorbent to reduce As(III) concentration in the pharmaceutical wastewater effluent generated from the manufacturing process of an arsenic-containing chemotherapeutic drug. The adsorbent was prepared by immersing wet agarose beads into FeCl3 (aq), followed by another immersion into NaOH (aq), resulting in HFO precipitation directly within the agarose beads. The As(III) adsorption rate of HFO-impregnated agarose beads was determined to be external diffusion-limited, and having a Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of 76.1 mg As(III)/g. Passing 6 L of the pharmaceutical wastewater through a packed column filled with the adsorbent in an upflow mode of 50 mL/min repeatedly for five times resulted in the reduction of As(III) concentration from 250 to 10 mu g of As(III)/L of H2O. Column desorption was performed by passing 0.6 L of 0.1 M NaOH (aq) through the column in an upflow mode of 50 mL/min repeatedly for five times to regenerate the As(III)-adsorbed HFO-impregnated agarose beads. Chemical characterizations revealed that the As(III) species were adsorbed on HFO by the "inner-sphere" bidentate complexation via ligand exchange or "outer-sphere" association via electrostatic interaction, while the "outer-sphere"-associated As(III) species were most likely desorbed.

AB Population growth coupled with wide spread of illness in both man and other animals have extensively increased the production and use of pharmaceutical products with various antibiotics discharged into the surrounding ecosystem. Such antibiotics when consumed by man and other living organisms cause serious health issues and therefore, there is need for urgent attention to treat such wastewater before been discharged. The application of synthesized multi-walled carbon nanotubes, MWCNTs as a novel adsorbent for the removal of metronidazole and levofloxacin in a batch adsorption process was investigated. Nickel-ferrites dope Activated carbon was produced via impregnation process and applied for the synthesis of MWCNTs in a CVD reactor. The produced nickel-ferrites doped activated carbon was characterized for thermal stability, surface area and surface morphology using TGA, BET and SEM respectively. The TGA result indicates high thermal stability of the catalyst with peak degradation temperature of 360.21 degrees C and slate-like nature morphology. The Brunette-Emmett-Teller result shows the surface area of pure activated carbon and Fe-Ni supported on activated carbon to be 840.38 and 650.45 m(2)/g respectively. The surface morphology of the produced carbon nanotubes depicts the presence of long-strand tubes of carbon nanotubes. The results of the adsorption process revealed that the adsorption parameters were fitted to the pseudo-second order model. The kinetics model of the adsorption of metronidazole and levofloxacin on the de adsorbent is fitted to pseudo-first order kinetic while Freundlich isotherm described the sorption of metronidazole and levofloxacin with a strong bonding between the molecules of the sorbate and the surfaces of the adsorbent. The results of the study indicate the possible development of low-cost and high purity MWCNTs adsorbent for the sorption of metronidazole and levofloxacin from pharmaceutical wastewater using activated carbon derived from wood sawdust.

AB Nowadays, alternative options to conventional wastewater treatment should be studied due to rising concerns emerged by the presence of pharmaceuticals compounds (PhCs) in the aquatic environment. In this work, a combined system including biological treatment by activated sludge plus adsorption with activated carbon is proposed to remove three selected drugs (acetaminophen (ACT), caffeine (CAF) and ibuprofen (IBU)) in a concentration of 2 mg L-1 of each one. For it three sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were operated. SBR-B treated a synthetic wastewater (SWW) without target drugs and SBR-PhC and SBR-PhC + AC operated with SWW doped with the three drugs, adding into SBR-PhC + AC 1.5 g L-1 of a mesoporous granular activated carbon. Results showed that the hybrid system SBR-activated carbon produced an effluent free of PhCs, which in addition had higher quality than that achieved in a conventional activated sludge treatment in terms of lower COD, turbidity and SMP concentrations. On the other hand, five possible routes of removal for target drugs during the biological treatment were studied. Hydrolysis, oxidation and volatilization pathways were negligible after 6 h of reaction time. Adsorption mute only was significant for ACT, which was adsorbed completely after 5 h of reaction, while only 1.9% of CAF and 5.6% of IBU were adsorbed. IBU was the least biodegradable compound.

AB We present and evaluate a framework for estimating concentrations of pharmaceuticals over time in wildlife feeding at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The framework is composed of a series of predictive steps involving the estimation of pharmaceutical concentration in wastewater, accumulation into wildlife food items, and uptake by wildlife with subsequent distribution into, and elimination from, tissues. Because many pharmacokinetic parameters for wildlife are unavailable for the majority of drugs in use, a read-across approach was employed using either rodent or human data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Comparison of the different steps in the framework against experimental data for the scenario where birds are feeding on a WWTP contaminated with fluoxetine showed that estimated concentrations in wastewater treatment works were lower than measured concentrations; concentrations in food could be reasonably estimated if experimental bioaccumulation data are available; and read-across from rodent data worked better than human to bird read-across. The framework provides adequate predictions of plasma concentrations and of elimination behavior in birds but yields poor predictions of distribution in tissues. The approach holds promise, but it is important that we improve our understanding of the physiological similarities and differences between wild birds and domesticated laboratory mammals used in pharmaceutical efficacy/safety trials, so that the wealth of data available can be applied more effectively in ecological risk assessments.

AB This review focuses on the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) by biological, chemical and hybrid technologies in effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Results showed that endocrine disruption chemicals (EDCs) were better removed by membrane bioreactor (MBR), activated sludge and aeration processes among different biological processes. Surfactants, EDCs and personal care products (PCPs) can be well removed by activated sludge process. Pesticides and pharmaceuticals showed good removal efficiencies by biological activated carbon. Microalgae treatment processes can remove almost all types of ECs to some extent. Other biological processes were found less effective in ECs removal from wastewater. Chemical oxidation processes such as ozonation/H2O2, UV photolysis/H2O2 and photo Fenton processes can successfully remove up to 100% of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals, while EDCs can be better removed by ozonation and UV photocatalysis. Fenton process was found less effective in the removal of any types of ECs. A hybrid system based on ozonation followed by biological activated carbon was found highly efficient in the removal of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals. A hybrid ozonation-ultrasound system can remove up to 100% of many pharmaceuticals. Future research directions to enhance the removal of ECs have been elaborated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cefdinir, a semi-synthetic third generation cephalosporin antibiotic being considered as an emerging pollutant, demands removal from aquatic ecosystems. A yeast strain isolated from pharmaceutical wastewater which was identified as Ustilago sp. SMN03 by molecular techniques and was found to be capable of utilizing cefdinir as a sole carbon source. The isolate was found to degrade 81 % of cefdinir within 6 days under optimized conditions viz. pH 6.0, temperature 30 A degrees C, a shaking speed of 120 rpm, an inoculum dosage of 4 % (w/v) and an initial cefdinir concentration of 200 mg L-1. Kinetic studies revealed that cefdinir degradation followed the pseudo-first order model, a rate constant of 0.222 per day and a half-life period of 3.26 days. Using LC-MS analysis, six novel intermediates formed during the cefdinir degradation were identified and characterized. FT-IR analysis showed that the functional groups ranging from 1,766 to 1,519 cm(-1), characteristic for lactam ring were completely removed during the cefdinir degradation. The opening of the beta-lactam ring was one of the major steps in the cefdinir degradation process. Based on the results from the present study, a possible pathway of cefdinir degradation by Ustilago sp. SMN03 was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on microbial degradation of cefdinir by yeast.

AB Three eco-friendly and cost-effective analytical methods were developed and optimized for quantitative analysis of some veterinary drug residues in production wastewater samples. The studied drugs were ivermectin, rafoxanide and sulfadimidine. A solid-phase extraction procedure was employed using Bond Elut C18 cartridges, prior to analysis. The first method was a chemometric approach called multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). A calibration model was developed and several figures of merit (RMSEP, SEP, bias, RE%) were calculated. The second method was a thin layer chromatography followed by densitometric measurements at 245 nm. The separation was performed using silica gel 60 F-254 plates and ethyl acetate : acetonitrile : toluene : ammonia (20 : 3 : 2 : 1, by volume) as a developing system. The third method was a high performance liquid chromatographic separation on HiQsil C18 HS column with UV detection at 245 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile : methanol : water (60 : 25 : 15, by volume), with a flow rate of 1.5 mL min(-1). The proposed methods were validated according to ICH guidelines. The described procedures were applied to quantify the studied drug residues in synthetic and real industrial wastewater samples. The proposed methods were statistically compared with the official and the reported methods, showing no significant difference with respect to accuracy and precision at P = 0.05.

AB Nowadays, major problems worldwide derive from the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds in the wastewater of hospitals and healthcare facilities. To address this issue, biological transformation of diclofenac using native and immobilized laccase is described in our study. Laccase stabilization is demonstrated, using two different types of immobilization: cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) and magnetic cross-linked enzyme aggregates (mCLEAs). High diclofenac (DCF) removal capacity of CLEAs laccase and mCLEAs laccase in comparison to native laccase is determined. Under optimal conditions, the removal capacity of native laccase is 11.5 +/- 0.3 mg DCF/glaccase, of CLEAs 15.6 +/- 0.4 mg DCF/glaccase and of mCLEAs 13.6 +/- 0.4 mg DCF/glaccase. Our immobilized laccase also possesses very good reusability, since the half-life of the immobilized laccase in the form of CLEAs is reached after the second cycle of biocatalyst reuse, while the half-life of the mCLEAs laccase can be detected at the fourth cycle. The improved stability of immobilized laccase in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) is shown. The promising results of DCF removal using CLEAs laccase and mCLEAs laccase show that both immobilized forms of laccase have the potential to be used in cleaner industrial technologies, e.g. wastewater treatment.

AB Due to the large number of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in water and wastewater, their degradation during UV-based advanced oxidation (UV/AOP) is best monitored using a conservative indicator compound. The present study demonstrates the in situ use of sucralose, a widely consumed artificial sweetener, as a conservative probe for UV/AOP degradation of TOrCs. The main qualities of sucralose in this regard are its high concentration in wastewater effluent and surface water (enabling its direct detection), its resistance to direct UV photolysis, and its relatively slow reaction with hydroxyl radical. Degradation of sucralose was compared to the degradation of commonly detected TOrCs, across two AOPs (i.e. UV/H2O2 and UV/NO3), in both lab-scale and pilot-scale systems. In all cases, UV/AOP degradation of sucralose was slower than the degradation of the examined TOrCs, and is expected to be slower than the degradation of the majority of other environmentally relevant TOrCs. These results demonstrate the potential of sucralose as a conservative probe, to monitor the transformation of TOrCs during UV/AOP treatment. Furthermore, degradation of sucralose was slower than the degradation of many transformation products (generated during oxidation of TOrCs), implying that sucralose is also a valuable indicator for the decay of primary transformation products.

AB The horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HFCW) is widely studied for the treatment of wastewater containing emerging organic contaminants (EOCs): pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and steroidal hormones. This study evaluates the performance of HFCW for the removal of these types of EOCs based on the data collected from peer-reviewed journal publications. In HFCW, anaerobic biodegradation is an important removal mechanism of EOCs besides their removal by the filter media (through sedimentation, adsorption, and precipitation) and plant uptake. The average removal efficiency of 18 selected EOCs ranged from 39% to 98%. The moderate to higher removal efficiency of 12 out of 18 selected EOCs in HFCW indicates the suitability of this type of CW for the treatment of wastewater containing these EOCs. The reasonably good removal (>50% in most of the cases) of these EOCs in HFCW might be due to the occurrence of anaerobic biodegradation as one of their major removal mechanisms in CWs. Although the effluent concentration of EOCs was substantially decreased after the treatment, the environmental risk posed by them was not fully reduced in most cases. For instance, estimated risk quotient of 11 out of 18 examined EOCs was extremely high for the effluent of HFCW.

AB Sulfonamides, such as sulfadiazine (SDZ), are frequently detected in water and wastewater with their toxic and persistent nature arousing much concern. In this work, a novel electrochemical membrane biofilm reactor (EMBfR) was constructed for the removal of SDZ whilst suppressing the development of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Results showed that the EMBfR achieved 94.9% removal of SDZ, significantly higher than that of a control membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) without electric field applied (44.3%) or an electrolytic reactor without biofilm (77.3%). Moreover, the relative abundance of ARGs in the EMBfR was only 32.0% of that in MBfR, suggesting that the production of ARGs was significantly suppressed in the EMBfR. The underlying mechanisms relate to (i) the change of the microbial community structure in the presence of the electric field, leading to the enrichment of potential aromatic-degrading microorganisms (e.g., Rhodococcus accounting for 51.0% of the total in the EMBfR compared to 10.0% in the MBfR) and (ii) the unique degradation pathway of SDZ in the EMBfR attributed to the synergistic effect between the electrochemical and biological processes. Our study highlights the benefits of EMBfR in removing pharmaceuticals from contaminated waters and suppressing the development (and transfer) of ARGs in the environment.

AB This study evaluated the capacity of a pilot-scale high-rate algal pond (HRAP) to remove pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) from domestic wastewater in the city of Santiago de Cali, Colombia. The compounds analyzed included antiepileptics, hypolipidemic drugs, tranquilizers and analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. The HRAP operated under a continuous water flow of 0.2 m(3)d(-1)and a 3-day hydraulic retention time (HRT). Removal efficiencies were high (>70%) for fenofibric acid, ibuprofen, and paracetamol; medium (30-70%) for gabapentin, lamotrigine, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, and pentoxifylline; and low (<30%) for carbamazepine and its metabolite 10,11-Dihidro-10,11-dihidroxicarbamazepine (CBZ-Diol). The findings herein are similar to other studies, but were obtained with a shorter HRT. These results show that tropical environmental conditions favor photodegradation and contribute to the development of microalgae and the biodegradation process. Twenty microalgae species were identified, with the phylumChlorophytaas the most abundant, particularly due to its natural introduction. The removal of the PCs also reflected a percentage reduction (>50%) in the ecological hazard posed by most of the compounds, although it is important to note that the hazard from gemfibrozil and ibuprofen remained high even after treatment, indicating the need for complementary treatment.

AB Three types of anaerobic granular sludge for treating chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater were compared: (1) an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) filled with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads (UASB-PVA); (2) a UASB filled with traditional anaerobic granular sludge; and (3) a UASB filled with traditional anaerobic granular sludge and granular active carbon (UASB-GAC). The domestication times for the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC reactors were 30, 47, and 47 days, respectively. When the organic loading rate (OLR) was up to 7 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/ (m(3).d), the COD efficiency of the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC stayed in the range of 69% to 75% (deviation 1.8%), 46% to 69% (deviation 8.6%), and 61% to 73% (deviation 4.0%), respectively. The highest OLRs reached for the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC were 12, 7, and 8 kg COD/(m(3).d), respectively. The performance of the UASB-PVA was the best of the three, the UASB-GAC was second, and the UASB was the worst. High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis showed that Levilinea, Syntrophorhabdus, Desulfovibrio and Acetobacterium were the dominant bacteria in the UASB-PVA, UASB, and UASB-GAC reactors' granular sludge. The abundance and diversity of the microbial community in the UASB-PVA sludge were higher than for the UASB and UASB-GAC granular sludge.

AB Amphibian populations have been decreasing in urban freshwater systems in Korea. To elucidate the biological safety of treated wastewater effluent (TWE) in the Tancheon basin, the capital area of Korea, a 7-d-exposure Bombina orientalis embryo developmental toxicity assay was examined during the breeding season. In March, there were no significant differences in embryonic survival or malformation among the water samples. In July, following monsoon precipitation, embryonic lethality in TWE was significantly higher than in the upstream water sample. Malformation in TWE and TWE-mixed waters was significantly higher than in the control and upstream water samples. Tail muscle height of tadpoles also significantly decreased in TWE and TWE-mixed waters. Heavy metals were not detected in any samples. Total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chemical oxygen demand in TWE markedly increased together with a decrease in dissolved oxygen in July. The increase in organic and inorganic loading following precipitation could have made TWE and TWE-mixed water not suitable for embryonic development. Though being managed based on physicochemical criteria, the water quality of TWE may not be sufficient to assure normal development of amphibian embryos. An amphibian developmental toxicity assay would be helpful for the water-quality management of TWE and urban freshwater systems in Korea. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:954-961. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB The present study was aimed at treating pharmaceutical industry wastewater employing chemical coagulation and ozonation process. Coagulation was carried out by alum and lime. Parameters like coagulant type & dose, settling time and pH ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 g/L., 10 to 60 min and 4 to 10 respectively were investigated. Coagulation with alum proved to be effective with a dose of 0.75 g/L at pH 6 leading to 59% COD and 76.8% turbidity removal. Ozonation was carried out for 10-60 min. The COD abatement mechanism of ozonation is changed in unbuffered samples and is only 13.5% after 1 h ozonation. However, 93.4% color removal was reported at the same ozonation time. The treatment strategy is handy in treating pharmaceutical wastewaters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article was presented as a position paper during the Environmental Biotechnology and Microbiology Conference in Bologna, Italy in April 2012. It indicates major and emerging environmental biotechnology research and development (R&D) priorities for EU members in the field of sustainable remediation and purification of agro-industrial and municipal wastewater. The identified priorities are: anaerobic/aerobic microbial treatment, combination of photochemical and biological treatment, phytoremediation and algae-based remediation, as well as innovative technologies currently investigated, such as enzyme-based treatment, bioelectrochemical treatment and recovery of nutrients and reuse of cleaned water. State of the art, research needs and prospective development in these domains are crucially discussed. As a result, goals of the future development of bioremediation and purification processes are defined and the way to achieve them is proposed.

AB CWO and WO were carried out for oxidizing different industrial wastewaters of pharmaceutical production, at 230 degrees C and 250 degrees C and total pressure of 50 bar, with oxygen, in stainless steel autoclaves. The catalysts were titania supported precious metal (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) oxides and copper sulfate. Samples were analyzed with respect to their TOC, COD (BOD) content. The tested wastewaters, some of them mother liquors, could be oxidized, but with rather different conversions. Even at the hard-to-oxidize wastewater the COD decrease hit the 50 % during 4 hours, this procedure decreased the COD/BOD ratio. The Ru oxide-titania catalyst proved to be the most active in this process, yet in the non-catalytic reactions significant conversion was detected also, due to the Fe or Cu ion content of the wastewaters.

AB Pharmaceutical monitoring (37 pharmaceuticals and 3 human tracers) was conducted in a headwater streams in southwest France, an area characterized by a low population density with an elderly population (30% > 60 years old) and extensive agriculture (cow cattle breeding). Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) were exposed for 14-day consecutive periods in 2016 at three sampling points. Three human wastewater tracers and 20 pharmaceuticals commonly used for human and/or cattle were quantified in headwaters. Succession of small Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), non-collective sanitation, discharges of untreated effluents as well as the river ability to dilute discharged wastewater, mainly explain the pharmaceuticals and human tracers concentrations. Pharmaceutical loads were time-dependent and were higher during cold season due to increase of pharmaceutical consumption. In contrast, better degradation and/or sorption onto river biofflms in warm season induced the decrease of headwater pharmaceutical content. The headwaters streams were contaminated by compounds found in other type of watershed, but beta-blocker were the compounds quantified in higher concentration with frequencies of 100%, which was consistent with the elderly population living in the watershed. Specific compounds (sulfamerazine and sulfamethoxazole) used to cattle medical care were detected in waters, but at a low content.

AB The treatment of oil refinery wastewater has attracted a significant attention for containing hazardous pollutants and causing adverse impacts on the environment. Three submerged membrane bioreactors (MBRs) treating synthetic oil refinery wastewater containing aromatic hydrocarbons including toluene and anthracene were operated at the different solids retention times (SRT) (10, 30 and 60 days) to investigate pollutants removals and membrane fouling characteristics. Mycobacterium and Sphingomonas capable of degrading aromatic compounds found in MBRs may contribute to high removal efficiencies (> 99%) of aromatic hydrocarbons at three SRTs. It is observed that nitrifying bacteria at short SRT of 10 days was in low abundance, and the resulting removal efficiency of NH4+-N was only 79%, which is much lower than those in MBRs at the SRTs of 30 and 60 days (> 97%). Severe membrane fouling and the minimal membrane fouling was observed at the SRT of 10 and 30 days respectively. Additionally, the investigation of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) content including the protein and polysaccharide induced by SRT indicated that high LB-EPS concentration at the SRT of 10 days caused severe membrane fouling. The relative abundances of the biofilm-forming bacteria Deinococcus and the bulking and foaming bacteria Caldilineaceae found in three MBRs correlated well with membrane fouling rate.

AB In Nigeria, pharmaceutical wastewaters are routinely disseminated in river waters; this could be associated with public health risk to humans and animals. In this study, we characterized antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and their antibiotic resistance profile as well as screening for sul1 and sul2 genes in pharmaceutical wastewater effluents. Bacterial composition of the wastewater sources was isolated on non-selective media and characterized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S rRNA genes, with subsequent grouping using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. The antibiotics sensitivity profiles were investigated using the standard disk diffusion plate method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antibiotics on the bacterial isolates. A total of 254 bacterial strains were isolated, and majority of the isolates were identified as Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. A total of 218 (85.8%) of the bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. High MICs values were observed for all antibiotics used in the study. The result showed that 31.7%, 21.7% and 43.3% of the bacterial isolates harbored sul1, sul2, and Intl1 genes, respectively. Pharmaceuticals wastewaters are potential reservoirs of ARBs which may harbor resistance genes with possible risk to public health.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) augmented with terrestrial white-rot basidiomycetes have already been tested for the removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewaters. Within the present study, an aquatic ascomycete (Phoma sp.) was initially demonstrated to efficiently remove several PhACs at their real environmental trace concentrations from nonsterile municipal wastewater on a laboratory scale. Then, a pilot MBR was bioaugmented with Phoma sp. and successively operated in two configurations (first treating full-scale MBR effluent as a posttreatment, and then treating raw municipal wastewater). Treatment of influent wastewater by the Phoma-bioaugmented pilot MBR was more efficient than influent treatment by a concomitantly operated full-scale MBR lacking Phoma sp and posttreatment of full-scale MBR permeate using the pilot MBR. A stable removal of the PhACs carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DF) (39 and 34% on average, respectively) could be achieved throughout the pilot MBR influent treatment period of 51 days, without the need for additional nutrient supplementation (full-scale MBR: on average, 15% DF but no CBZ removed during 108 days). The long-term presence of Phoma sp. in the pilot MBR could be demonstrated using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, but still open questions regarding its long-term activity maintenance remain to be answered.

Therefore, we examined the fate of nine commonly-used antibiotics (ampicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, oxacillin, oxolinic acid, penicillin G, pipemidic acid, and tetracycline) in differentially treated wastewater and reclaimed water from two U.S. regions. We collected 72 samples from two Mid-Atlantic and two Midwest treatment plants, as well as one Mid-Atlantic spray irrigation site. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests and Kruskal Wallis tests. Overall, antibiotic concentrations in effluent samples were lower than that of influent samples. Mid-Atlantic plants had similar influent but lower effluent antibiotic concentrations compared to Midwest plants. Azithromycin was detected at the highest concentrations (of all antibiotics) in influent and effluent samples from both regions. For most antibiotics, transport from the treatment plant to the irrigation site resulted in no changes in antibiotic concentrations, and UV treatment at the irrigation site had no effect on antibiotic concentrations in reclaimed water. Our findings show that low-level antibiotic concentrations persist in reclaimed water used for irrigation; however, the public health implications are unclear at this time.

AB Organic micropollutants (OMPs) may occur ubiquitously in the aquatic environment. In order to protect the ecosystem and drinking water sources from potentially toxic effects, discharges of an increasing number of OMPs are being regulated. OMP removal from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents as a point source is a preferred option with removal by adsorption onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) and OMP transformation to presumably harmless compounds by ozonation as the most promising techniques. In this study, effluents of four WWTPs were treated with PAC and ozone in bench-scale experiments to compare the removal efficiencies of seven relevant OMPs. Concentrations of carbamazepine and diclofenac were reduced by more than 90% with 20 mg/L PAC or 5-7 mg/L ozone (0.5 mg O-3 per mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC)). Comparing typical doses for practical applications ozonation proved to be more efficient for abatement of sulfamethoxazole, while removal of benzotriazole and iomeprol was comparatively more efficient with activated carbon. While well known for ozonation, DOC-normalized doses were also applied to PAC and correlated better to relative OMP removal than volume proportional PAC addition. Furthermore, OMP removal efficiencies corresponded well with the reduction of ultraviolet light absorption at 254 nm for both treatment options. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A yearlong field experimental campaign was conducted to reveal time scales over which antibiotic fluxes vary in the influent of a wastewater treatment plant (WTP). In particular, sampling was carried out to ascertain the amplitudes of monthly, daily and hourly fluctuations of several antibiotics. A total of 180 samples was collected at the entrance of a WTP in Lausanne, Switzerland. Sample concentrations were multiplied by flow rate to obtain monthly, daily and hourly mass fluxes of six antibiotics (trimethoprim, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clindamycin and metronidazole). Seasonality in mass fluxes was observed for all substances, with maximum values in winter being up to an order of magnitude higher than in summer. The hourly measurements of the mass flux of antibiotics were found to have a period of 12 h. This was due to peaks in toilet use in the morning and early evening. In particular, the morning peak in flushing coincided with high concentrations (and hence high mass fluxes) due to overnight accumulation of substances in urine. However, little variation was observed in the average daily flux. Consequently, fluctuations in mass fluxes of antibiotics were mainly evident at the monthly and hourly time scales, with little variation on the day-week time scale. These results can aid in optimizing removal strategies and future sampling campaigns focused on antibiotics in wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals, such as beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as their metabolites are introduced into the water cycle via municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in all industrialized countries. As the amino acid sequences of the biological target molecules of these pharmaceuticals the beta-1 adrenergic receptor for beta-blockers and the cyclooxygenase for NSAIDs - are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrates it is reasonable that wildlife vertebrates including fish physiologically respond in a similar way to them as documented in humans. Consequently, beta-blockers and NSAIDs both exhibit their effects according to their mode of action on one hand, but on the other hand that may lead to unwanted side effects in non-target species. To determine whether residuals of beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase inhibitors may pose a risk to aquatic organisms, one has to know the extent to which such organisms respond to the total of active compounds, their metabolites and transformation products with the same modes of action. To cope with this demand, two cell-based assays were developed, by which the total beta-blocker and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity can be assessed in a given wastewater or surface water extract in real time. The measured activity is quantified as metoprolol equivalents (MetEQ) of the lead substance metoprolol in the beta-blocker assay, and diclofenac equivalents (DicEQ) in the NSAID assay. Even though MetEQs and DicEQs were found to surpass the concentration of the respective lead substances (metoprolol, diclofenac), as determined by chemical analysis by a factor of two to three, this difference was shown to be reasonably explained by the presence and action of additional active compounds with the same mode of action in the test samples. Thus, both in vitro assays were proven to integrate effectively over beta-blocker and NSAID activities in WWTP effluents in a very sensitive and extremely rapid manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern; thus, there is a growing interest in exploring the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment as well as the factors that contribute to their emergence. Aquatic ecosystems provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and spread of ARGs due to the continuous pollution by antimicrobial compounds derived from anthropogenic activities. We investigated, therefore, the pollution level of a broad range of antibiotics and ARGs released from hospital and urban wastewaters, their removal through a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and their presence in the receiving river. Several antimicrobial compounds were detected in all water samples collected. Among antibiotic families, fluoroquinolones were detected at the highest concentration, especially in hospital effluent samples. Although good removal efficiency by treatment processes was observed for several antimicrobial compounds, most antibiotics were still present in WWTP effluents. The results also revealed that copy numbers of ARGs, such as bla(TEM) (resistance to beta-lactams), qnrS (reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones), ermB (resistance to macrolides), sulI (resistance to sulfonamides) and tetW (resistance to tetracyclines), were detected at the highest concentrations in hospital effluent and WWTP influent samples. Although there was a significant reduction in copy numbers of these ARGs in WWTP effluent samples, this reduction was not uniform across analyzed ARGs. Relative concentration of ermB and tetW genes decreased as a result of wastewater treatment, whereas increased in the case of bla(TEM), still and qnrS genes. The incomplete removal of antibiotics and ARGs in WWTP severely affected the receiving river, where both types of emerging pollutants were found at higher concentration in downstream waters than in samples collected upstream from the discharge point. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a widespread occurrence of antibiotics and ARGs in urban and hospital wastewater and how these effluents, even after treatment, contribute to the spread of these emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB This research was performed to assess the production of reclaimed water from urban wastewater in membrane bioreactor - advanced oxidation process (MBR-AOP) and moving bed biofilm reactor - membrane bioreactor - advanced oxidation process (MBBR-MBR-AOP) combined treatments to study the effect of biofilm incorporation. Both combined treatments were operated at the same conditions (10 h of hydraulic retention time, 6500 mg/L of mixed liquor suspended solids and 25 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide dosage over 15 min). Additionally, the removal capacity of some pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen) and their impact on the kinetic behaviour of the biomass in both systems were evaluated. From the results, it was found a membrane-based bioreactor can achieve both wastewater secondary treatment and pre-treatment for advanced oxidation process, so both MBR-AOP and MBBR-MBR-AOP treatments have a great potential to produce high quality reclaimed water (biological oxygen demand <0.5 mgO(2)/L, suspended solids <1 mg/L, turbidity <1 NTU and no presence of E. coli), according to European Commission proposal 2018/0169/COD. The addition of carriers improved the biodegradation of the most persistent pharmaceuticals in the biological treatment (from 69.20 +/- 1.54% to 75.14 +/- 2.71% for carbamazepine and from 60.41 +/- 2.16 to 63.14 +/- 2.70% for ciprofloxacin). It had, as a consequence, the MBBR-MBR-AOP system showing a complete degradation of pharmaceuticals after 5 min AOP treatment compared to the MBR-AOP system. The loss of biomass in the MBR-AOP (from 5233.45 to 4451.92 mg/L) and the increase of the substrate degradation rate for organic matter in both treatments (from 37.27 to 41.42 and from 30.25 to 33.19 mgO(2)/(L.h) in MBR-AOP and MBBR-MBR-AOP, respectively) are some of the consequences of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater.

AB This study aims to assess the occurrence, fate and temporal and spatial distribution of anthropogenic contaminants in a river subjected to different pressures (industrial, agricultural, wastewater discharges). For this purpose, the Henares River basin (central Spain) can be considered a representative basin within a continental Mediterranean climate. As the studied river runs through several residential, industrial and agricultural areas, it would be expected that the chemical water quality is modified along its course. Thereby the selection of sampling points and timing of sample collection are critical factors in the monitoring of a river basin. In this study, six different monitoring campaigns were performed in 2010 and contaminants were measured at the effluent point of the main wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the river basin and at five different points upstream and downstream from the WWTP emission point. The target compounds evaluated were personal care products (PCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides. Results show that the river is clearly influenced by wastewater discharges and also by its proximity to agricultural areas. The contaminants detected at higher concentrations were the PCPs. The spatial distribution of the contaminants indicates that the studied contaminants persist along the river. In the time period studied no great seasonal variations of PCPs at the river collection points were observed. In contrast, a temporal trend of pesticides and PAHs was observed. Besides the target compounds, other new contaminants were identified and evaluated in the water samples, some of them being investigated for the first time in the aquatic environment. The behaviour of three important transformation products was also evaluated: 9,10-anthracenodione, galaxolide-lactone and 4-amino-musk xylene. These were found at higher concentrations than their parent compounds, indicating the significance of including the study of transformation products in the monitoring programmes.

AB The fate of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) was investigated in two nitrite-accumulating sequencing batch reactors operating under strictly aerobic (SBR1) conditions at different sludge ages (SRT, 1.7 to 17.1 d) and anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic ISM) conditions with different phases and durations of redox conditions, using a modified GC-MS analytical method for estrogen detection to ng/L concentrations. In SBR1, >= 98% of E2 was removed (specific E2 removal rate ranged from 0.375 (at SRT 17.1 d) to 2.625 (at SRT 1.7 d) mu g E2.g MLVSS-1.d(-1)) regardless of SRT or DO (<1.0 to >5.0 mg/L. Removal of E1 and, to a greater extent, EE2 was adversely affected when this reactor was operated at SRT shorter than 5.7 d. However, whereas E1 was removed efficiently as long as SRT was long enough for AOB to bring about nitritation, EE2 removal efficiency was significantly lower when SBR1 was operated at SRT longer than 7.5 d. This reduced removal of EE2 may have been caused by the inhibition and toxicity of nitrite, both to the ammonium monooxygenase (AMO) and to the microbial population generally. In SBR2, less removal of E2 was found at the lower MLVSS concentrations, and El was not removed by sludge with poor settling qualities. The removal of EE2 observed in SBR2 was considered to be mainly a result of sorption. However, the binding of estrogens to the sludge in this reactor was apparently not as strong as the binding observed in the sludge of the strictly aerobic SBR1, since desorption was observed during the aeration phase in SBR2.

AB The C:N ratio of the pharmaceutical wastewaters is usually suitable for a combination of the anaerobic pretreatment with the high COD removal and aerobic posttreatment with the efficient biological N removal. This kind of anaerobic-aerobic process was tested in semipilot scale by using a UASB reactor and an activated sludge system with a predenitrification (total volume 1001). It was found that at a total HRT of 2.3 days an average of 97.5% of COD and 73.5% of total N was removed. The UASB reactor was operated at 30 degrees C with a volumetric loading rate of 8.7 kg.m(-3).d(-1), the efficiency of COD removal was 92.2%. The processes, which rake part in the biological removal of nitrogen, especially the nitrification, were running with lower rates than usually observed in aerobic treatment systems.

AB The increasing concern about the emerging contaminants, especially the endocrine disrupting chemicals, which include pesticides and the pharmaceuticals and personal care products, has stirred up the rate of monitoring their presence in the environment. Triclosan is one such chemical used as an antibacterial and antimicrobial in many personal care products. This chemical is present in very low amounts in the personal care products, but its appearance in the environment becomes a matter of concern due to its detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, this paper focuses on determination of Triclosan concentration in the personal care products used by the residents of Patna municipal area. It also focuses on finding out the ultimate load of Triclosan discharged and its corresponding concentration in the wastewaters of Patna.

AB A rapid analytical procedure based on high performance liquid chromatography for identification and quantification of amoxicillin in wastewaters after its degradation by advanced oxidation process (AOP) was developed and validated. The proposed methodology was validated concerning to linearity, precision, limit of quantification, and limit of detection according to the required INMETRO and ANVISA (regulatory agencies in Brazil) standards. The method was applied to the determination of amoxicillin in wastewaters from wastewater treatment plant of a Brazilian pharmaceutical industry spiked with amoxicillin after AOP treatment process on a pilot scale reactor. The method allows the determination of the referred drug in a concentration range of 10-100mgL(-1) with a detection limit of 2.32mgL(-1), a quantification limit of 7.04mgL(-1), and enabling control of contaminant removal.

AB Hourly samples of tertiary wastewater effluent were analyzed for 30 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, estrogenic steroids, and alkylphenols in order to better understand the rate at which these compounds enter the environment. Several distinct patterns of daily cycling were observed, and were characterized as three separate categories. The concentrations of compounds such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, naproxen, estrone, and triclosan varied greatly during a daily cycle, with relative standard deviations exceeding 100% of their daily mean. Less extreme daily cycles were seen for other compounds such as azithromycin, atenolol, tert-octylphenol, iopromide and gemfibrozil. Peak concentrations for most compounds occurred in the early evening (5-8 pm). However, some compounds including carbamazepine, primidone, fluoxetine, and triclocarban exhibited little or no variability.

AB Over the past decade a great amount of interest has arisen regarding the occurrence and fate of trace organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Of particular concern are human hormones and pharmaceuticals, many of which are ubiquitous contaminants in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents when measured with ng/L detection limits. As analytical procedures and bioassay techniques become more readily available and increasingly sensitive, new contaminants will be discovered. The presence or absence of any chemical in a wastewater effluent is essentially a function of analytical detection capability. This poses a unique challenge for drinking water treatment plants intent on the removal of organic contaminants, as complete removal is merely a reflection of reporting limits. The investigation described here sought to determine the occurrence, treatment, and human health relevance of a chemically diverse group of emerging contaminants.

AB This is the first study of broad range of chemical classes CECs conducted in the upper Wisla river catchment including the biggest WWTPs in this region and surface waters. The list of compounds is extensive and the paper provides, for the first time, better understanding of environmental burden from PCPCs in Poland. Cumulative contribution of hypertension pharmaceuticals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and lifestyle chemicals was 89% and 95% in wastewater influent, and 75% in wastewater effluent at both WWTPs. Significant removal efficiencies, exceeding 90%, were found for parabens, UV filters, NSAIDs, steroid estrogens, plasticizers, antibacterials/antibiotics, stimulants and metabolites and lifestyle chemicals. The comparison of the average mass loads of CECs between the influent and effluent, has shown that 27% and 29% of all detected CECs were removed by less than 50%. An increase of concentrations of CECs in the effluent was observed for 18% and 20% of all detected CECs in Kujawy and Plaszow WWTPs, respectively. Negative mass balances of fexofenadine, venlafaxine, o-desmethyltramadol, ketamine and temazepam were noted within WWTPs, which are a result of dissolution of persistent contaminants accumulated in aggregates and/or back-transformation or deconjugation of metabolites into parent compounds. 44 CECs were detected in surface waters located upstream and downstream of the WWTPs. The concentrations of compounds were largely dependent on the dilution factor of WWTP discharge. The risk quotation (RQ) values for compounds present in surface waters were calculated in relation to their potential for bioaccumulation. Among compounds with high potential for bioaccumulation, with log K-ow >= 4.5, diclofenac, atorvastatin and triclosan were found to be of high risk. Many CECs with high, moderate or even low environmental impact have shown high potential for bioaccumulation and should be considered as priority at the same risk level. Moreover, possible synergistic action is still of concern. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Conventional wastewater treatment lacks the ability to remove many pharmaceuticals. This is leading to emissions to the natural aquatic environment, where these compounds pose a risk to the aquatic or-ganisms. An advanced wastewater treatment technique that has shown promising results is Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR). Initial degradation velocity and degradation rate constants of the pharmaceuticals are important parameters for designing an optimal MBBR system; however, the degradation efficiency varies across studies and one of the most plausible causes might be initial concentration. Thus, to verify the effect of initial concentration, the degradation of a mixture of 18 pharmaceuticals at different initial concentrations was studied. For this study MBBR's with very low BOD loading were used as they were conditioned with effluent water. The experiment was set up as a MBBR batch incubation, using effluent wastewater as medium, spiked with the 18 pharmaceuticals in seven different concentration levels (approximately 0-300 mu g L-1). The degradation of 14 out of 18 pharmaceuticals was concentration dependent. The initial degradation velocity of the pharmaceuticals was either proportional to the initial concentration or was following a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetic. The degradation velocity of one compound, i.e., sulfamethizole might have been inhibited at high concentrations. The degradation rate constants from single first-order fittings (K-SFO) for some compounds deviated from the expected behavior at low concentrations (below 10 mu g L-1). This is suggested to be caused by simplicity of the MichaelisMenten model, not taking possible occurrence of co-metabolism and mass-transfer limitations into account at low concentrations. This study underlines the fact that K values cannot be interpreted without paying attention to the tested concentration level. Furthermore, it shows that the used MBBRs was able to handle high concentrations of pharmaceuticals, and that the most efficient removal occurs at concentrations above 100 mu g L-1.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are two types of microbial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that use microorganisms to convert chemical energy in wastewaters into useful energy products such as (bio)electricity (MFC) or hydrogen gas (MEC). These two systems were evaluated for their capacity to attenuate trace organic compounds (TOrCs), commonly found in municipal wastewater, under closed circuit (current generation) and open circuit (no current generation) conditions, using acetate as the carbon source. A biocide was used to evaluate attenuation in terms of biotransformation versus sorption. The difference in attenuation observed before and after addition of the biocide represented biotransformation, while attenuation after addition of a biocide primarily indicated sorption. Attenuation of TOrCs was similar in MFCs and MECs for eight different TOrCs, except for caffeine and trimethoprim where slightly higher attenuation was observed in MECs. Electric current generation did not enhance attenuation of the TOrCs except for caffeine, which showed slightly higher attenuation under closed circuit conditions in both MFCs and MECs. Substantial sorption of the TOrCs occurred to the biofilm-covered electrodes, but no consistent trend could be identified regarding the physico-chemical properties of the TOrCs tested and the extent of sorption. The octanol water distribution coefficient at pH 7.4 (log D-pH 7.4) appeared to be a reasonable predictor for sorption of some of the compounds (carbamazepine, atrazine, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and diphenhydramine) but not for others (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). Atenolol also showed high levels of sorption despite being the most hydrophilic in the suite of compounds studied (log D-pH (7.4) = -1.99). Though BESs do not show any inherent advantages over conventional wastewater treatment, with respect to TOrC removal, overall removals in BESs are similar to that reported for conventional wastewater systems, implying the possibility of using BESs for energy production in wastewater treatment without adversely impacting TOrC attenuations.

AB This study focuses on the reaction of ozone with constituents of activated sludge liquor with the aim of understanding the behavior of organic micropollutants and to analyze the changes in the mixed liquor sludge matrix. To do so, different sludge sampling campaigns from two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were treated with different transferred ozone doses (TOD) and analyzed observing the effect on the sludge properties and micropollutants removal. Indeed, the ozone treatment promotes changes in the sludge matrix, increasing the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) solubilization until the Immediate Ozone Demand (IOD) completion and decreasing the Sludge Volume Index (SVI). Moreover, significant pharmaceutical removals have been achieved with low transferred ozone doses (TODs), reaching removals up to 99% depending on the compound.

AB In present study, we have investigated the treatment of Ayurveda pharmaceutical wastewater (APW) by electrocoagulation (EC) treatment method to minimize the energy consumed per unit mass of COD removed and maximize the color and COD removals by using the stainless steel (SS) and aluminum (Al) electrodes. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the multiple responses during the batch mode study of APW treatment. A full factorial central composite experimental design has been used to determine the experiments for each factors and optimize the responses: color removal (R-1), COD removal (R-2), and energy consumed per unit mass of COD removed (R-3). At optimized conditions, R-1 = 97.83%, R-2 = 58.35% and R-3 = 27.12 kWh/kg COD removed for Al electrodes and R-1 = 95.35%, R-2 = 78.88% and R-3 = 28.32 kWh/kg COD removed for SS electrodes, respectively were obtained. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) have been used to determine the EC treatment mechanism and disposal aspects of EC solid residue (scum and sludge). EC treatment mechanism of APW seems to be a combination of electro-floatation, electro-oxidation, and electro-coagulation. (C) 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Organic contaminants (OCs), such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, flame retardants, and plasticisers, are societally ubiquitous, environmentally hazardous, and structurally diverse chemical compounds whose recalcitrance to conventional wastewater treatment necessitates the development of more effective remedial alternatives. The engineered application of ligninolytic oxidoreductase fungal enzymes, principally white-rot laccase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase, has been identified as a particularly promising approach for OC remediation due to their strong oxidative power, broad substrate specificity, low energy consumption, environmental benignity, and cultivability from lignocellulosic waste. By applying an understanding of the mechanisms by which substrate properties influence enzyme activity, a set of semi-quantitative physicochemical criteria (redox potential, hydrophobicity, steric bulk and pKa) was formulated, against which the oxidoreductase degradation susceptibility of twenty-five representative OCs was assessed. Ionisable, compact, and electron donating group (EDG) rich pharmaceuticals and antibiotics were judged the most susceptible, whilst hydrophilic, bulky, and electron withdrawing group (EWG) rich polyhalogenated compounds were judged the least susceptible. OC susceptibility scores were in general agreement with the removal rates reported for experimental oxidoreductase treatments (R-2 = 0.60). Based on this fundamental knowledge, and recent developments in enzyme immobilisation techniques, microbiological enzymic treatment strategies are proposed to formulate a new generation of biological wastewater treatment processes for the biodegradation of environmentally challenging OC compounds.

AB The valorization of food wastes is a challenging opportunity for a green, sustainable, and competitive development of industry. Approximately 30 million m(3) of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) are produced annually in the world as a by-product of the olive oil extraction process. In addition to being a serious environmental and economic issue because of their polluting load, OMWW can also represent a precious resource of high-added-value molecules such as polyphenols that show acclaimed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and can find useful applications in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, the possibility to develop novel nutraceutical ophthalmic formulations containing free radical scavengers would represent an important therapeutic opportunity for all inflammatory diseases of the ocular surface. In this work, different adsorbents were tested to selectively recover a fraction that is rich in polyphenols from OMWW. Afterward, cytotoxicity and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory activities of polyphenolic fraction were evaluated through in vitro tests. Our results showed that the fraction (0.01%) had no toxic effects and was able to protect cells against oxidant and inflammatory stimulus, reducing reactive oxygen species and TNF-alpha levels. Finally, a novel stable ophthalmic hydrogel containing a polyphenolic fraction (0.01%) was formulated and the technical and economic feasibility of the process at a pre-industrial level was investigated.

AB River ecosystems are of immense ecological and social importance. Despite the introduction of wastewater treatment plants and advanced chemical authorization procedures in Europe, chemical pollution is still a major threat to freshwater ecosystems.
   Here, large-scale monitoring data was exploited to identify taxon-specific chemical concentrations beyond which benthic invertebrate taxa are unlikely to occur using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). 365 invertebrate taxa and 25 organic chemicals including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plasticisers, flame retardants, complexing agents, a surfactant and poly- and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a total of 399 sites were analysed. The number of taxa that responded to each of these chemicals varied between 0% and 21%. These sensitive taxa belonged predominantly to the groups Plecoptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Turbellaria, Megaloptera, Crustacea, and Diptera. Strong effects were observed in response to wastewater-associated compounds, confirming that wastewater is an important cause of biological degradation. The majority of change points identified for each compound were well below predicted no-effect concentrations derived from laboratory toxicity studies. Thus, the results show that chemicals are likely to induce effects in the environment at concentrations much lower than expected based on laboratory experiments.
   Overall, it is confirmed that chemical pollution is still an important factor shaping the distribution of invertebrate taxa, suggesting the need for continued efforts to reduce chemical loads in rivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work aims at decontaminating biologically treated domestic wastewater effluents from organic micropollutants by sulfate radical based (SO4 center dot-) homogeneous photo-Fenton involving peroxymonosulfate as an oxidant, ferrous iron (FeII)) as a catalyst and simulated solar irradiation as a light source. This oxidative system was evaluated by using several probe compounds belonging to pesticides (bifenthrin, mesotrione and clothianidin) and pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) classes and its kinetic efficiency was compared to that to the well known UV-Vis/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysis. Except for carbamazepine, apparent kinetic rate constants were always 10 times higher in PMS/Fe(II)/UV-Vis than in TiO2/UV-Vis system and more than 70% of total organic carbon abatement was reached in less than one hour treatment. Hydroxyl radical (OH) and SO4 center dot- reactivity was investigated using mesotrione as a probe compound through by-products identification by liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry and transformation pathways elucidation. In addition to two center dot OH based transformation pathways, a specific SSO4 center dot- transformation pathway which first involved degradation through one electron transfer oxidation processes followed by decarboxylation were probably responsible for mesotrione degradation kinetic improvement upon UV-Vis/PMS/Fe(II) system in comparison to UVVis/TiO2 system.

AB The dissemination of pharmaceuticals in agroecosystems originating from land application of animal manure/ sewage sludge and irrigation with treated wastewater in agricultural production has raised concern about the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in food products. The pathways of pharmaceutical entries via plant roots, transport to upper fractions, and the factors influencing these processes have yet been systematically elucidated, thus impeding the development of effective measures to mitigate pharmaceutical contamination in food crops. In this study, lettuce uptake of thirteen commonly used pharmaceuticals was investigated using a hydroponic experimental setting. Pharmaceutical sorption by lettuce roots was measured in order to evaluate the influence on pharmaceutical transport from roots to shoots. Small-sized pharmaceuticals e.g., caffeine and carbamazepine with molecular weight (MW)< 300 g mol(-1) and a low affinity to lettuce roots (sorption coefficient Kp < 0.05 L g(-1)) manifested substantial transport to shoots. Small-sized molecules lamotrigine and trimethoprim had a relatively strong affinity to lettuce roots (Kp > 12.0 L g(-1)) and demonstrated a reduced transport to shoots. Large-sized pharmaceuticals (e.g. MW> 400 g mol(-1)) including lincomycin, monensin sodium, and tylosin could be excluded from cell membranes, resulting in the predominant accumulation in lettuce roots. Large-sized oxytetracycline existed as zwitterionic species that could slowly enter lettuce roots; however, the relatively strong interaction with lettuce roots limits its transport to shoots. The mass balance analysis revealed that acetaminophen, beta-estradiol, carbadox, estrone and triclosan were readily metabolized in lettuce with > 90% loss during 144-h exposure period. A scheme was proposed to describe pharmaceutical uptake and transport in plant, which could reasonably elucidate many literature-reported results. Molecular size, reactivity and ionic speciation of pharmaceuticals, as well as plant physiology, collectively determine their uptake, transport and accumulation in plants.

AB The photolysis of diclofenac (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), and trimethoprim (TMP) was investigated using a low-pressure (LP) mercury ultraviolet (UV) lamp (254 nm) and a combination of UV with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). For each experiment, 5 mg/L of each pharmaceutical was prepared in pure water and individually degraded by either UV alone or UV/H2O2. DCF and SMX were highly susceptible to UV treatment and completely degraded to below their LC-MS detection limit (1 mu g/L) after only 8 min of UV irradiation. TMP and CBZ were more resistant to UV treatment, with only 58.2 and 25.2% degradation (after 1h UV exposure). The combination of H2O2 addition (up to 0.2 g/L) with UV significantly improved the removal rate of TMP and CBZ up to 91.2 and 99.7% of the initial concentration, respectively. A number of novel transformation compounds were identified as UV or UV/H2O2 degradation products using LC-MS. The range and amount of these transformation compounds strongly depended on the applied treatment conditions. The toxicity of each pharmaceutical solution before and after treatment was also evaluated and all parent compounds were non-toxic at the tested concentration (i.e. 5 mg/L). DCF, in particular, but also CBZ and SMX, showed an increase in solution toxicity after treatment with UV only, indicating the presence of photolytic degradation products that are more toxic than the parent compounds. Treatment with UV/H2O2 reduced the toxicity of all solutions to below the detection limit of the assay. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Personal care products (PCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are groups of organic contaminants that have been detected in biosolids around the world. There is a shortage of data on these types on compounds in Australian biosolids, making it difficult to gain an understanding of their potential risks in the environment following land application. In this study, 14 biosolids samples were collected from 13 Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to determine concentrations of eight compounds that are PCPs and/or EDCs: 4-t-octylphenol (4tOP), 4-nonylphenol (4NP), triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Concentration data were evaluated to determine if there were any differences between samples that had undergone anaerobic or aerobic treatment. The concentration data were also compared to other Australian and international data. Only 4tOP, 4NP, TCS, and BPA were detected in all samples and El was detected in four of the 14 samples. Their concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 3.08 mg/kg, 0.35 to 513 mg/kg, <0.01 to 11.2 mg/kg, <0.01 to 1.47 mg/kg and <45 to 370 mu g/kg, respectively. The samples that were obtained from WWTPs that used predominantly anaerobic treatment showed significantly higher concentrations of the compounds than those obtained from WWTPs that used aerobic treatment. Overall, 4NP, TCS and BPA concentrations in Australian biosolids were lower than global averages (by 42%, 12% and 62%, respectively) and 4tOP concentrations were higher (by 25%), however, of these differences only that for BPA was statistically significant. The European Union limit value for NP in biosolids is 50 mg/kg, which 4 of the 14 samples in this study exceeded. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Real pharmaceutical wastewater was treated by photocatalytic oxidation and catalytic wetair oxidation (CWAO) processes. The catalytic performance of Fe/AC and LaFeO3/AC (AC: Commercial activated carbon) was compared in the advanced oxidation processes. The influences of the reaction parameters were determined by using Box-Behnken design. Fe/AC catalyst was more effective in both of the photocatalytic oxidation and catalytic wet air oxidation processes. In the photocatalytic oxidation process, 72.7% COD removal was achieved at pH = 4.5, 2.0 g/L, and [H2O2](o)=0.32 mM. Under the optimum conditions of the CWAO, which were determined as 3 g/L of catalyst loading, pH = 3, and 50 degrees C, 83.1% COD removal efficiency was obtained. CWAO method was determined as more suitable since a higher COD removal efficiency was achieved in a shorter reaction time. The toxicity in terms of L. sativum growth inhibition was evaluated as 4.82% after the CWAO treatment. A two-step first-order reaction kinetics provided the best fit of the CWAO experimental data. The activation energies of the fast and the slow steps were 25,661.16 and 28,327.46 J/mole, respectively. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Propylene glycol (PG), commonly used in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries and considered non-PBT, is still an emerging contaminant of concern due to its widespread use. In this study, an isolate of a bacterial consortium obtained from an effluent treatment plant,MC1S, was used to degrade PG. The growth kinetics of the isolate was studied under aerated and non-aerated conditions. The isolate was able to effectively grow in saline water under aerated conditions using PG as the substrate. Using response surface methodology (RSM), the effect of pH, salinity, PG concentration, phosphate and nitrate concentration on cell growth and PG degradation was investigated. The isolated bacterium,MC1S, was capable of degrading PG with a maximum of 79% COD reduction observed and was able to withstand comparatively high salinity of the medium. Solution pH and salinity were the most important parameters affecting degradation. Salinity less than 0.1 M and pH close to 8 appeared to be the optimum conditions for PG degradation. HPLC analysis of the treated sample appeared to show the presence of three daughter products. Using RSM, a quadratic equation model between COD reduction and the process variables was developed. The results indicated that aerobic treatment of PG under specific conditions was the best approach for the specific isolate.

AB In this study, forward osmosis (FO) membranes and fouling solutions were systematically characterized to elucidate the effects of organic fouling on the rejection of two pharmaceutically active compounds, namely, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine. Municipal wastewater resulted in a more severe flux decline compared to humic acid and sodium alginate fouling solutions. This result is consistent with the molecular weight distribution of these foulant solutions. Liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection analysis shows that municipal wastewater consists of mostly low molecular weight acids and neutrals, which produce a more compact cake layer on the membrane surface. By contrast, humic acid and sodium alginate consist of large molecular weight humic substances and biopolymers, respectively. The results also show that membrane fouling can significantly alter the membrane surface charge and hydrophobicity as well as the reverse salt flux. In particular, the reverse salt flux of a fouled membrane was significantly higher than that under clean conditions. Although the rejection of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine by FO membrane was high, a discernible impact of fouling on their rejection could still be observed. The results show that size exclusion is a major rejection mechanism of both sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine. However, they respond to membrane fouling differently. Membrane fouling results in an increase in sulfamethoxazole rejection while carbamazepine rejection decreases due to membrane fouling.

AB Reuse of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent is used to augment freshwater supplies globally. The Shenandoah River Watershed (U.SA.) was selected to conduct on-site exposure experiments to assess endocrine disrupting characteristics of different source waters. This investigation integrates WWTP wastewater reuse modeling, hydrological and chemical characterization, and in vivo endocrine disruption bioassessment to assess contaminant sources, exposure pathways, and biological effects. The percentage of accumulated WWTP effluent in each river reach (ACCWW%) was used to predict environmental concentrations for consumer product chemicals (boron), pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine), and steroidal estrogens (estrone, 17-beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol). Fish endocrine disruption was evaluated using vitellogenin induction in adult male or larval fathead minnows. Water samples were analyzed for >500 inorganic and organic constituents to characterize the complex contaminant mixtures. Municipal ACCWW% at drinking water treatment plant surface water intakes ranged from <0.01 to 2.0% under mean-annual streamflow and up to 4.5% under mean August streamflow. Measured and predicted environmental concentrations resulted in 17-beta-estradiol equivalency quotients ranging from 0.002 to 5.0 ng L-1 indicating low-to-moderate risk of fish endocrine disruption. Results from the fish exposure experiments showed low (0.5- to 3.2-fold) vitellogenin induction in adult males.

AB Effluent from the secondary treatment of municipal wastewater was treated with membrane filtration to reduce its toxicity. Five different inorganic membranes were tested, namely, an a-alumina microfiltration membrane, an anatase titania ultrafiltration membrane, a gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane, an amorphous titania nanofiltration membrane, and an amorphous hybrid organo-silica membrane. The permeabilities and selectivities (color, UV254-absorbing components, conductivity and inorganic nitrogen compounds) of the membranes were determined, and the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane was found to be the most promising membrane for the treatment of the effluent. The effluent flux was measured to be approximately 40 L m(-2) h(-1) for the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane, and it removed nearly 75% of the UV254-absorbing components and 15% of the ions. It also removed 40% of the CuCl and 25% of the CuSO4 from the spiked effluent. The fouling resistance was less pronounced for the gamma-alumina membrane compared with the other membranes. The removal of fecal indicator bacteria was determined by measuring the amounts of Escherichia coli and Enterococci, and the removal of toxic compounds was investigated in bioassays with Daphnia magna and Aliivibrio fischeri. The gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane reduced the wastewater concentration of E. coli (97.3%) and Enterococci (98.4%), and the bioassays demonstrated that filtration with the gamma-alumina nanofiltration membrane reduced the overall toxicity of the effluent.

AB Adsorption has demonstrated great promise for removing dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), but effective solutions to alleviate the competitive adsorption of different types of DON are lacking. Herein, a novel sequential adsorption technology is designed for DON fractional removal from actual biotreated pharmaceutical wastewater. Three carbon xerogels (CXs) are customized via precisely controlling the gel process and constructing the macropore (CX5.4, 163-647 angstrom)-mesopore (CX6.2, 80-212 angstrom)-micropore (CX6.8, 17-136 angstrom) sequential adsorption column. The sequential adsorption column exhibits superior performance compared with that of single CX columns, which can effectively remove DON (82.3%), reduce acute toxicity (87.4%), and have suitable regeneration ability (14.7% decreased after three cycles). Analysis of DON removal characteristics [molecular weight (MW) and molecular composition] reveals that CX5.4 preferentially removes the high-MW DON via hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, alleviating irreversible regeneration. CX6.8 enhances the removal of the low-MW and high-unsaturated DON molecules via pore filling and pi-pi interactions, further decreasing toxicity. Due to the coexistence of the adsorption mechanism described above, CX6.2 is the main DON adsorption unit. Moreover, the CX sequential adsorption column is more cost-effective than activated carbon. Overall, this study provides an effective and sustainable technology for DON adsorption treatment in actual wastewater.

AB A 180 L anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was operated for 253 days to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater, which mainly composed of beta-lactams antibiotics (BLAs) including amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and ampicillin. The operation was divided into three stages with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 48 h, 36 h and 24 h, respectively, the corresponding average organic loading rates (OLRs) and antibiotics loading rates (ALRs) increased from 2.37 +/- 0.28 to 4.46 +/- 0.87 kg-CODm(3).d(-1), and from 19.06 +/- 0.67 to 37.91 +/- 3.57 g-BLAsm(-3).d(-1), respectively. The highest removal efficiencies of amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and ampicillin were 73.2 +/- 4.3%, 47.7 +/- 2.2%, 79.4 +/- 4.1% and 34.6 +/- 3.3%, respectively. The obtained total COD removal efficiency was as high as 94.0% and accompanied with VFA accumulation (249 +/- 25 to 375 +/- 61 mg.L-1) as well as biogas generation (0.195 +/- 0.017 to 0.291 +/- 0.032 L.gCOD(removal)(-1)), > 66% of which was methane (0.135 +/- 0.011 to 0.196 +/- 0.021 L.gCOD(removal)(-1)). Moreover, basing on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) theory, the mathematical models were developed and well calibrated for simulating the AnMBR performance in the biodegradation of COD and antibiotics.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the adsorption of heavy metals (Cr-TOT, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) in wastewater originated from galvanization process and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone) in aqueous solutions on waste sludge. To get the insight in the adsorption process, the adsorption kinetics and mechanisms are described. The physico-chemical properties of the waste sludge were determined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction technique, energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry, surface area and gas adsorption porosimetry, and laser diffraction. The adsorption on waste sludge was performed as batch tests and the concentration of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals was monitored by atomic absorption spectrometry and UV/Vis spectrophotometry, respectively. The rates of pharmaceuticals adsorption dependent on different initial concentration were explained. The kinetics of heavy metal ions and pharmaceuticals adsorption on the sludge was analyzed using four different models. The pseudo secondorder model assuming chemical adsorption as the rate limiting process showed the best agreement. Furthermore, the results revealed that the adsorption involves complex processes, including film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. The investigated industrial waste sludge is a promising non-hazardous and a low cost sorbent with relatively high surface area which can be used for removal of heavy metal ions (CrTOT, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+), and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone) from wastewater.

AB Emissions of many organic micro-pollutants (OMP) into the aquatic environment can be efficiently reduced with advanced treatment at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Post-treatment with activated carbon is currently considered as one of the most promising options, but powdered activated carbon (PAC) could also be dosed into the existing biological treatment process instead. Due to much greater concentrations of suspended and dissolved constituents the adsorptive OMP removal was expected to be severely hindered. Systematic comparative adsorption tests with samples from different process steps of a large conventional WWTP were conducted to investigate differences in adsorption competition and removal efficiencies. The results show that much greater competition occurs in the WWTP influent and in the anaerobic tank but removal efficiencies in the anoxic and aerobic tank and in the WWTP effluent were more similar than expected. Suspended solids thus seem not to severely affect OMP adsorption. Similar results were obtained in a comparison of different commercial PAC in all for the respective matrices. OMP removals showed a relation with the PAC dosage normalized to the concentration of dissolved organic carbon. In the anoxic and aerobic tank and in the WWTP effluent, a uniform correlation of OMP removals and reductions of UV light absorption was observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sucralose, a chlorinated carbohydrate, is used as an artificial sweetener in more than 80 countries and in excess of 4,000 products. Thus far, minimal research has been done on the degradation and fate of sucralose in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We collected samples from WWTPs and surface waters in Arizona, United States. The average sucralose concentration of seven WWTP effluents was 2,800 +/- 1,000 ng/L. Similarly, surface waters in Arizona contained sucralose at concentrations up to 300 +/- 30 ng/L, which corroborates sucralose discharge from WWTPs into the environment. Biological degradation and chemical oxidation processes were evaluated to remove or transform sucralose under potential WWTP operation scenarios. Sucralose did not degrade in aerobic or anaerobic biological reactors, either metabolically or co-metabolically (in the presence of sucrose), after 42-62 days of experiments. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation did not oxidize sucralose significantly, and chlorine and ozone addition led only to slow sucralose oxidation. Sucralose is not expected to degrade by free chlorine or ozone under typical WWTP operational conditions. Our results suggest that no significant sucralose degradation occurs in WWTPs, that it is present in their effluent waters, and that it reaches environmental water sources. We report for the first time the presence of sucralose in U. S. inland surface waters. Our measurements of sucralose concentrations in WWTP effluents and surface waters also confirm the low degradability of sucralose.

AB Dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the water environment has become an increasing concern. There have been many reports on ARGs in surface water, but little is known about ARGs in groundwater. In this study, we investigated the profiles and abundance of ARGs in groundwater in comparison with those in surface water of Maozhou River using high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR). Totally 127 ARGs and 10 MGEs were detected by HT-qPCR, and among them the sulfonamides, multidrug and aminoglycosides resistance genes were the dominant ARG types. According to the results of HT-qPCR, 18 frequently detected ARGs conferring resistance to 6 classes of antibiotics and 3 MGEs were further quantified by qPCR in the wet season and dry season. The absolute abundance ranged from 1.23 x 10(5) to 8.89 x 10(6) copies/mL in wet season and from 8.50 x 10(2) to 2.65 x 10-(6) copies/mL in the dry season, with suit and sul2 being the most abundant ARGs. The absolute abundance of ARGs and MGEs has no significant difference between the wet season and dry season while the diversity of ARGs in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season (p < 0.05). Totally 141 and 150 ARGs were detected in the water and sediments of Maozhou River, respectively. A total of 116 ARGs were shared among the groundwater, river water, and sediment, which accounted for 67.1% of all detected genes. Redundancy analysis further demonstrated that the environmental factors contributed 70.7% of the total ARG variations. The findings of large shared ARGs, abundant Total Coliforms and large wastewater burden in the groundwater provide a clear evidence that anthropogenic activities had a significant impact on groundwater.

AB Diclofenac (DCF) exists extensively in sewage treatment plant effluent, and it is one of the most reported environmental pharmaceutical contaminants. In this work, the photocatalytic degradation of DCF by titanium dioxide (TiO2) in pure water under visible light and the influence of humic acids (HA) (as a kind of dissolved organic matter (DOM), phosphate and ferrous ion (Fe2+)) were investigated. The results showed that the lower the pH was, the better the degradation effect of DCF under acidic conditions was. Different concentrations of DOM, phosphate ion, and Fe2+ could inhibit the degradation of DCF, and the higher the concentration was, the stronger the inhibition was. Different concentrations of chloride ions had little effect on the degradation. A slight elimination (8-12.9%) of total organic carbon (TOC) was observed during the mineralization of DCF with and without DOM and inorganic ions, indicating poor mineralization during the process of photocatalytic degradation, and DOM, phosphate, and Fe2+ had little effect on DCF mineralization. Furthermore, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and singlet oxygen radicals were present during the photocatalytic degradation of DCF. DOM and inorganic ions could inhibit the intensity of hydroxyl radical and promote superoxide radicals (O-2(-)) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) to varying degrees. Finally, the degradation mechanism and main products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and nine possible intermediates were detected. Hydroxylation, dechlorination, cyclization, and oxidation were the main degradation mechanisms. However, DOM, phosphate, and Fe2+ did not affect the type of intermediate products in terms of the mass-to-charge ratio. This paper mainly studied the mechanisms of different influencing factors in simulated environments to provide a theoretical basis for the degradation of DCF in wastewater treatment plants.

AB Wastewater discharges from cities and industries, especially megacities, and intensive livestock can be considered as main sources of pollution of our rivers and groundwater. Water pollution, therefore, constitutes a major threat to both aquatic ecosystems and human health. Here we address the influence of chemical pollution in waste- and drinking water, their associated potential toxicological effects, as well as, the available technologies for their removal.
   This opinion paper provides illustrative selected examples covering a broad range for both drinking water and wastewater treatment processes, for which a battery of toxicity tests is applied for their risk assessment. The examples are classified based on five hot topics: (i) Bioassays for toxicity evaluation, (ii) Toxicity of municipal wastewaters, (iii) Toxicity of pharmaceutical residues and hospital wastewaters, (iv) Toxicity of other non-urban effluent examples, and (v) Drinking water treatment processes and toxicity evaluation. 'Chemical analysis combined with batteries of bioassays covering a broad range of endpoints: cytotoxicity, endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, and other types seem to be good way to assess performance/efficiency of the water treatment processes when removing chemical contaminants.. Altogether, while recognizing that water treatment is a cornerstone for water pollution reduction, providing safe water for both human use and its return back to the aquatic environment will be undoubtedly enhanced with the use of ecotoxicity biomonitoring.

AB The surface display laccase (SDL) biocatalyst, where the enzyme laccase is displayed on the surface of biological cells through synthetic biology, provides a new opportunity to develop sustainable technologies for removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater. This study vigorously characterized biocatalytic properties of the SDL in comparison to free laccase in removing emerging contaminant acetaminophen (APAP), with the aim to understand the effect of surface display on enzyme functionality and identify the strategy to overcome the potential limitation. The SDL could effectively remove APAP. Adding redox mediators substantially improved the removal efficiency. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis showed that the redox mediator 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate could overcome the limitation of APAP accessing the active site of laccase in the SDL biocatalyst. The APAP removal rate catalyzed by the SDL in real secondary wastewater effluent was higher than that in acetate buffer; comprehensive enzyme kinetic analysis provided clear evidence that there were redox mediating compounds in the wastewater. Analysis of transformation products revealed that surface display did not change laccase functionality in terms of APAP transformation mechanism. In addition, the SDL retained 88% of the initial activity after six repeated APAP biotransformation reactions. Results from this study provide a scientific basis for developing and implementing SDL as an innovative biocatalytic material for contaminant treatment applications.

AB Removal efficiencies of sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and its degradation intermediates formed by treatment with zeolite/TiO2 composites through adsorption and photocatalysis were investigated in fresh aquaculture wastewater (FAWW). Coexistent substances in the FAWW showed no inhibitory effects against SMM adsorption. Although coexistent substances in the FAWW inhibited the photocatalytic decomposition of SMM, the composites mitigated the inhibition, possibly because of concentration of SMM on their surface by adsorption. LC/MS/MS analyses revealed that hydroxylation of amino phenyl and pyrimidinyl portions, transformation of the amino group in the amino phenyl portion into a nitroso group, and substitution of the methoxy group with a hydroxyl group occurring in the initial reaction resulted in the formation of various intermediates during the photocatalysis of SMM. All detected intermediates had a ring structure, and almost all intermediates disappeared at the same time SMM was completely decomposed. Ph-OH formed by hydroxylation of the phenyl portion was detected upon decomposition of SMM during photocatalysis. The removal of Ph-OH by the composites proceeded more rapidly than that by TiO2 alone under ultraviolet irradiation. The SMM and Ph-OH were completely degraded by the composites within 30 min, showing that the zeolite/TiO2 composites were effective in removing SMM and its intermediates from FAWW.

AB The high-concentration pharmaceutical intermediate wastewater treatment was studied experimentally by using a coupled membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) system, which included ozone oxidation as pretreatment, MABR biochemical method, and improved coagulation-flocculation technology as post-treatment. First, the influence of ozone production rate and reaction time on chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/COD (B/C) ratio was explored. 53% COD reduction and an increase of B/C ratio from 0.22 to 0.46 were achieved under the conditions of 6 g h(-1) of dose and 30 min of reaction time. Subsequently, multi-group continuous experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT), aeration pressure, and flow velocity on C and N removals in MABR system. With 24 h HRT, aeration pressure of 0.15 MPa, and flow velocity of 0.08 m s(-1), 95% COD removal and 92% total nitrogen (TN) reduction were obtained simultaneously in the MABR process. Finally, the improved coagulation-flocculation was applied using polyaluminium chloride (PAC, 1.2 g L-1) combined with polyacrylamide (PAM, 2 mg L-1) and magnetic powder (8-10 g L-1) to generate excellent effluent quality for industrial reuse in China (GB/T 19923-2005). In conclusion, O-3-MABR-improved coagulation/flocculation technology was feasible for treating pharmaceutical intermediate wastewater for reuse.

AB This study addresses the possibility for low pressure reverse osmosis membrane (RE 2521, CSM) process to serve as an alternative to remove selected antibiotics (ampicillin and amoxicillin) from synthetic wastewater by changing operating conditions such as pH = 3, 6.5 and 10; Pressure = 9, 11 and13 (bar); antibiotic concentration = 10, 255 and 500(mg/L), and temperature = 20, 30 and 40 degrees C. The experiment was designed based on Box-benken, which is a Response Surface methodology design (RSM), using Design Expert software. The concentration of antibiotics was measured by applying a UV-spectrophotometer (Cecil), at the wavelength of 254 nm. Results showed a range of rejection percentage from 73.52% to 99.36% and 75.1% to 98.8%, for amoxicillin and ampicillin, respectively. Considering the solute rejections and the membrane porosity show that the prevailing rejection mechanism of the examined antibiotics by the membrane was the size exclusion effect. The permeate flux for both of the antibiotics was 12-18.73 L/m(2).h. Although the permeate flux and antibiotic rejection are influenced by operating pressure, pH, and temperature individually, the interaction between operating parameters did not have noticeable effects. According to the results obtained in this study, the application of RO membrane is recommended for the selected antibiotics to be removed to a considerable degree (up to 95%).

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are important sources of settleable particulate material (SPM), heading to sediments with natural suspended solids. To date, there is little information about the fate of pharmaceuticals in sediment systems. In this study, the objective was to determine if pharmaceuticals are detected in SPM at locations near WWTPs or even in rural areas, thus being susceptible for sedimentation.
   SPM samples were collected from 10 sites in Finland, grouped as reference, rural and wastewater effluent sites. SPM collectors were placed about 35 cm above bottom for about 2 months during summer. After extraction. a set of 17 pharmaceuticals was analyzed.
   Several pharmaceuticals were detected in SPM accumulated at sites next to WWTPs. The concentration of citalopram was notably high (300-1350 ng g(-1) dw). Also bisoprolol and ciprofloxacin were detected at high concentrations (6-325 and 9-390 ng g(-1) dw, respectively). In contrast, none of the pharmaceuticals were detected from reference sites and only two were found from a single rural site.
   There is no previous information about the presence of pharmaceuticals in SPM. The results showed that pharmaceuticals are sorbed to particles in WWTP and nearby, eventually ending up in sediments. These results also indicate that pharmaceuticals are not markedly contaminating sediments of rural areas in Finland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dilution factors are a critical component in estimating concentrations of so-called down-the-drain chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals) in rivers. The present study estimated the temporal and spatial variability of dilution factors around the world using geographically referenced data sets at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution. Domestic wastewater effluents were derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population. Monthly and annual river flows were estimated by accumulating runoff estimates using topographically derived flow directions. National statistics, including the median and interquartile range, were generated to quantify dilution factors. Spatial variability of the dilution factor was found to be considerable; for example, there are 4 orders of magnitude in annual median dilution factor between Canada and Morocco. Temporal variability within a country can also be substantial; in India, there are up to 9 orders of magnitude between median monthly dilution factors. These national statistics provide a global picture of the temporal and spatial variability of dilution factors and, hence, of the potential exposure to down-the-drain chemicals. The present methodology has potential for a wide international community (including decision makers and pharmaceutical companies) to assess relative exposure to down-the-drain chemicals released by human pollution in rivers and, thus, target areas of potentially high risk.

AB The performance of a membrane bioreactor operating in a sequential mode (SMBR) using an external flat-plate membrane was investigated. After 200 days of operation, a single addition of 1 g L(-1) Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) was added directly into the mixed liquor in order to enhance the simultaneous removal of nutrients and pharmaceutical micropollutants from synthetic urban wastewater. Throughout the entire operation (288 days), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiencies were up to 95%, ammonium nitrogen removal was maintained over 70-80%, whereas phosphorus removal achieved only high values (around 80%) after PAC addition. During the operation of the SMBR without PAC addition, micropollutants which exerted a more recalcitrant behaviour were carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac and trimethoprim, with no significant removal. On the other hand, moderate removals (42-64%) were observed for naproxen and erythromycin, whereas ibuprofen, roxithromycin and fluoxetine were removed in the range of 71-97%. The addition of PAC into the aeration tank was a successful tool to improve the removal of the more recalcitrant compounds up to 85%. The highest removal with PAC was observed for carbamazepine, trimethoprim as well as for roxithromycin, erythromycin and fluoxetine. The latter four compounds have amine groups and pKa in the range 6.7-10.1, thus the interaction between PAC and the positively charged amino groups might be the cause of their comparatively better results. Microbial ecology present in the biomass showed a higher abundance of Accumulibacter phosphatis as well as the ammonium oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Nitrosomonas after PAC addition.

AB Magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNT) of different dimensions and different magnetiteto-carbon nanotube (Mag:CNT) ratios were prepared and characterized for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ketoprofen (KET), diclofenac sodium (DIC) and ibuprofen (IBU)) from water prior to their HPLC determination. The results revealed that the best mixing ratio of (Mag:CNT) was at (1:1) ratio; long CNT was better than short CNT; the best external diameter was 60-100 nm. This sorbent was labeled as L-MCNT60-100(nm)(1:1). The optimum MSPE-HPLC method was as follows: 150 mg of L-MCNT60-100(nm)(1:1) sorbent was added to 50 mL solution containing KET, DIC and IBU at pH 5. The solution was shaken for 30 min and the sorbent was separated from the solution using an external magnet. The adsorbed analytes were eluted using 5 mL of 10% ammonia in methanol and the eluent was then injected into HPLC instrument. Figures of merit were estimated to be as follows (KET, DIC and IBU, respectively): detection limits: 0.4, 0.5, 0.5 -g L-1; sensitivity: 3.13, 3.40, 1.46 L mg(-1) ; %RSD range: [2.6-7.2], [2.2-5.1], [2.7-6.4] %; bias range (%): [(-26.8)-(14.0)], [(7.4)-(17.0)], [(-8.4)-(17.8)]%. Application on tap water and pharmaceutical wastewater gave spiked recovery as follows: Tap water: KET: 103.7%(+/- 5.4); DIC: 110.3%(+/- 5.3); IBU: 70.1%(+/- 6.5); Pharmaceutical wastewater: KET: 58.8%(+/- 7.2); DIC: 48.9%(+/- 5.9); IBU: 100.5%(+/- 8.2). Adsorption studies were conducted to measure the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents where the effect of MCNT dimensions, magnetite loading and competitive adsorption were investigated.

AB Opioids, both as prescription drugs and abuse substances, have been a but topic and a focus of discussion in the media for the last few years. Although the literature published shows the occurrence of opioids and some of their metabolites in the aquatic environment, there are scarce data in the application of high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for the analysis of these compounds in the environment. The use of HRMS allows increasing the number of opioids that can be studied as well as the detection of unknown opioids, their metabolites and potential transformation products. In this work, a retrospective analysis for the identification of opioids and their metabolites using a curated database was applied to surface water and wastewater samples taken in the state of Minnesota (U.S.) in 2009, which were previously analyzed by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) for antidepressants. The database comprised >200 opioids including natural opiates (e.g. morphine and codeine), their semi-synthetic derivatives (e.g. heroin, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycoclone, oxymorphone, mepericline and buprenorphine), fully synthetic opioicls (e.g. fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, dextromethorphan and propoxyphene), as well as some of their metabolites (e.g. 6-monoacetylcodeine, dextrorphan, COOP, normorphine and O-desmethyltramadol). Moreover, additional MS-MS experiments were performed to confirm their identification, as well as to recognize fragmentation patterns and diagnostic ions for several opioids. These data provide a better understanding of the historical occurrence of opioids and their metabolites in surface waters impacted by wastewater sources. The concentrations of individual opioids in surface water and wastewater effluent varied from 8.8 (LOOP) to 1640 (tramadol) ng L-1 and from 12 (dihydrocodeine) to 1288 (tramadol) ng L-1, respectively. The opioids with higher overall frequency detections were tramadol, dextromethorphan and its metabolite, dextrorphan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents contain potentially neuroactive chemicals though few methods are available to screen for the presence of such agents. Here, two parallel approaches (in vivo and in vitro) were used to assess WWTP exposure-related changes to neurochemistry. First, fathead minnows (FHM, Pimephales promelas) were caged for four days along a WWTP discharge zone into the Maumee River (Ohio, USA). Grab water samples were collected and extracts obtained for the detection of alkylphenols, bisphenol A (BPA) and steroid hormones. Second, the extracts were then used as a source of in vitro exposure to brain tissues from FHM and four additional species relevant to the Great Lakes ecosystem (rainbow trout (RT), river otter (RO), bald eagle (BE) and human (HU)). The ability of the wastewater (in vivo) or extracts (in vitro) to interact with enzymes (monoamine oxidase (MAO) and glutamine synthetase (GS)) and receptors (dopamine (D2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)) involved in dopamine and glutamate-dependent neurotransmission were examined on brain homogenates. In vivo exposure of FHM led to significant decreases of NMDA receptor binding in females (24 -42%), and increases of MAO activity in males (2.8- to 3.2-fold). In vitro, alkylphenol-targeted extracts significantly inhibited D2 (66% in FHM) and NMDA (24-54% in HU and RT) receptor binding, and induced MAO activity in RT, RO, and BE brains. Steroid hormone-targeted extracts inhibited GS activity in all species except FHM. BPA-targeted extracts caused a MAO inhibition in FHM, RT and BE brains. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, this study shows that WWTP effluents contain agents that can interact with neurochemicals important in reproduction and other neurological functions. Additional work is needed to better resolve in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE) as well as cross-species differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological treatment processes offer the ideal conditions in which a high diversity of microorganisms can grow and develop. The wastewater produced during these processes is contaminated with antibiotics and, as such, they provide the ideal setting for the acquisition and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This research investigated the occurrence and variation in the ARGs found during the one-year operation of the anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater that contained combinations of sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline-erythromycin (STE) and sulfamethoxazole-tetracycline (ST). The existence of eighteen ARGs encoding resistance to sulfamethoxazole sul2, sul3), erythromycin (ermA, ermF, ermB, msrA, ereA), tetracycline (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetM, tetS, tetQ tetW, tetX) and class I integron gene (intI 1) in the STE and ST reactors was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Due to the limited availability of primers to detect ARGs, Illumina sequencing was also performed on the sludge and effluent of the STE and ST reactors. Although there was good reactor performance in the SBRs, which corresponds to min 80% COD removal efficiency, tetA, tetB, sul1, sul2 and ermB genes were among those ARGs detected in the effluent from STE and ST reactors. A comparison of the ARGs acquired from the STE and ST reactors revealed that the effluent from the STE reactor had a higher number of ARGs than that from the ST reactor; this could be due to the synergistic effects of erythromycin. According to the expression of genes results, microorganisms achieve tetracycline and erythromycin resistance through a combination of three mechanisms: efflux pumping protein, modification of the antibiotic target and modifying enzymes. There was also a significant association between the presence of the class 1 integron and sulfamethoxazole resistance genes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In April 2016, a series of earthquakes (M 7.3 on the Japan Meteorological Agency scale) occurred in Kumamoto, Japan causing serious damage to underground sewerage networks. In this study, we evaluated sewer exfiltration in groundwater in the Kumamoto area after the earthquakes by using multiple tracers. We used 14 pharmaceuticals, including carbamazepine and crotamiton, and anthropogenic Gd as tracers, and we measured concentrations of these tracers from September 2016 to November 2017 seasonally. The detection frequency of caffeine, carbamazepine, crotamiton, ibuprofen, and anthropogenic Gd ranged from 29% to 45%, and the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the groundwater were lower than those in previous studies. The median of all pharmaceutical concentrations did not decrease, whereas the median of the sum of crotamiton and carbamazepine concentrations, which are quantitative sewage markers, decreased with time. The sewer exfiltration rates in September 2016 estimated using carbamazepine, crotamiton, and anthropogenic Gd were 0.59 ? 0.27%, 0.66 ? 0.47%, and 0.11 ? 0.18% of sewage dry weather flow, respectively, indicating that the effect of the earthquakes on sewer exfiltration was small, probably because the damaged sewers were quickly repaired. This study demonstrated that a multiple-tracer approach is useful for evaluating sewer exfiltration after major earthquakes.

AB Human use of pharmaceuticals results in the excretion and disposal of compounds that become part of municipal and domestic waste streams. On-site waste water disposal and leaking city sewer systems can provide avenues for the migration of effluent to the underlying aquifers. This research assessed the occurrence and persistence of 22 target pharmaceuticals in septic tank effluent and two shallow, coarse-grained aquifers in western Montana. Twelve compounds (acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, erythromycin-18, nicotine, paraxanthine, ranitidine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and warfarin) were detected in a high school septic tank effluent. Three of the 12 compounds, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and nicotine, were detected in the underlying sand and gravel aquifer after effluent percolation through a 2.0-m thick sand vadose zone. Sampling of a second sand, gravel, and cobble dominated unconfined aquifer, partially overlain by septic systems and a city sewer system, revealed the presence of caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, nicotine, and trimethoprim. The presence of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in these aquifers appears to correlate with local usage based on a reported monthly prescription volume. This work highlights the need for expanding geochemical investigations of sewage waste impacted ground water systems to include sampling for selected pharmaceuticals.

AB For the first time, single and PAC-catalyzed ozonalion were explored for the wastewater treatment during wet weather flow in a prompt and efficient process. The effect of varying the ozone (O-3) specific dose on the removal of micropollutants (MPs) was first investigated with a mixture of pharmaceuticals, herbicides and perfluorinated compounds in clean water. Most MPs showed higher affinity towards catalytic ozonation. Carbamazepine and Atrazine were found to be good surrogates for fast and slow reacting compounds, respectively. Applying single or PAC-catalyzed ozonation for 1 min only after coagulation was more efficient than applying them simultaneously. PAC-catalyzed ozonation was more efficient for the removal of organics and O-3-resistant MPs. Both single and PAC-catalyzed ozonation achieved 4 log removal of E. coil, reduced the acute and genetic toxicity, and estrogenic activity of the wastewater. A detailed cost analysis revealed that applying single ozonation after coagulation costs between 0.06 and 0.32 $/m(3) while applying PAC-catalyzed ozonation costs between 0.32 and 0.63 $/m(3) for a flow rate between 100 and 600 MLD. Through a comprehensive performance assessment, PACcatalyzed ozonation was deemed superior with one drawback related to the disposal of PAC. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel coagulation combined with UV/O-3 process was employed to remove the effluent organic matter (EfOM) from a biotreated pharmaceutical wastewater for harmlessness. The removal behavior of EfOM by UV/O-3 process was characterized by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) integrating two-dimensional correlation (2D-COS) and principal component analysis (PCA) technology. The highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ratio of UV254 and DOC (SUVA) removal efficiency reached 55.8% and 68.7% by coagulation-UV/O-3 process after 60 min oxidation, respectively. Five main components of pharmaceutical tail wastewater (PTW) were identified by SFS. Spectral analysis revealed that UV/O-3 was selective for the removal of different fluorescent components, especially fulvic acid-like fluorescent (FLF) component and humus-like fluorescent (HLF) component. Synchronous fluorescence/UV-visible two-dimensional correlation spectra analysis showed that the degradation of organic matter occurred sequentially in the order of HLF, FLF, microbial humus-like fluorescence component (MHLF), tryptophan-like fluorescent component (TRLF), tyrosine-like fluorescent component (TYLF). The UV/O-3 process removed 95.6% of HLF, 80.0% of FLF, 56.0% of TRLF, 50.8% of MHLF and 44.4% of TYLF. Therefore, the coagulation-UV/O-3 process was proven to be an attractive way to reduce the environmental risks of PTW.

AB Water is a key solvent, fundamental to supporting life on earth. It is equally important in many industrial processes, particularly within agricultural and pharmaceutical industries, which are major drivers of the global economy. The results of water contamination by common activity in these industries is well known and EU Water Quality Directives and Associated Regulations mandate that NH4+ concentrations in effluent streams should not exceed 0.3 mg L-1, this has put immense pressure on organisations and individuals operating in these industries. As the environmental and financial costs associated with water purification begin to mount, there is a great need for novel processes and materials (particularly renewable) to transform the industry. Current solutions have evolved from combating toxic sludge to the use of membrane technology, but it is well known that the production of these membrane technologies creates a large environmental footprint. Zeolites could provide an answer: their pore size and chemistry enable efficient removal of aqueous based cations via simple ion exchange processes. Herein, we demonstrate efficient removal of NH4+ via both static and dynamic methodology for industrial application. Molecular modelling was used to determine the cation-framework interactions which will enable customisation and design of superior sorbents for NH4(+) capture in wastewater.

AB Donana National Park (Southern Spain) is one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe and is included in UNESCO's World Heritage List. A 1-year monitoring study was carried out to investigate the presence of 16 pharmaceutical compounds belonging to seven therapeutic groups in wastewater discharges, rivers and streams affecting Donana Park. Fourteen pharmaceuticals were detected in effluent wastewater at concentration levels up to 26.8 mu g L-1 and thirteen were detected in surface water at concentration levels up to 4.55 mu g L-1. Ibuprofen was the compound at the highest concentration levels. An increase of the concentration levels in surface water was observed in summer months due to the reduction of the flow rates of the rivers. Nevertheless, risk quotient values estimated in surface water were lower than one so no toxicological effect is suspected to occur. The highest average risk quotients were obtained for ibuprofen (risk quotient 0.67 +/- 0.28), gemfibrozil (risk quotient 0.52 +/- 0.33). propranolol (0.13 +/- 0.06) and naproxen (0.10 +/- 0.09). Nevertheless, in summer months, risk quotient values up to 9.3 and 10.7 were estimated for the estrogenic compounds 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of reclaimed wastewater irrigation on the alteration of soil properties and accumulation of trace metals in soil profiles was investigated by monitoring different plots from Palmdale. California that had been irrigated with effluents for various lengths of time (3, 8, and 20 years, respectively). The non-effluent-irrigated plot served as the control and provided reference "background" values. Total metals at different soil depths were analyzed by acid digestion, and EDTA-extractable metals were analyzed as available fraction. Results show that soil pH values were significantly (p < 0.05) lowered in plots with 20-year irrigation to a depth of 140 cm, while EC was elevated for all three plots compared with control. OM, TC and TN contents increased in the top 10-cm soil layers in plots with 8- and 20-year effluent irrigation. Irrigation with effluents also increased both the total and EDTA-extractable metals in the fields. It showed that long-term effluent irrigation could be of agricultural interest due mainly to its organic matter concentrations and nutrients input, however, trace contaminants such as heavy metals in the upper horizons may be accumulated, which may eventually lead to deterioration of soil and groundwater quality and affect the sustainability of land-based disposal of effluent.

AB Environmental exposure risk to different xenobiotics, which can potentially alter the function of the endocrine system, remains a great health and safety concern for aquatic species and humans. Steroid hormones, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been identified as important aquatic contaminants due to their widespread occurrence in surface waters and their endocrine disrupting properties. Heavily populated areas in South Florida not served by municipal wastewater collection present an unexpected high risk of anthropogenic contaminants to nearby coastal systems through surface runoff and groundwater flow. Previous studies in South Florida have been Largely concentrated on assessing the relevance of the fate and transport of inorganic nutrients, heavy metals and pesticides with regulatory criteria. Therefore, a significant gap exists in assessing occurrence, distribution and biological significance of the presence of human related organic contaminants in natural surface waters. In this study, we have developed a fast and sensitive online solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-HRMS) method using a Q-Exactive system for the determination of the occurrence and distribution of selected wastewater tracers/indicators, recalcitrant PPCPs and steroid hormones in South Florida surface waters. Seasonal and spatial variations of these contaminants were monitored from 2017 to 2019. The presence of total coliforms and E. coli were also evaluated in order to further assess water quality. Correlations between hormones and anthropogenic tracers were explored to better elucidate the sources, pathways and exposure risks to these contaminants. Caffeine, sucralose, Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEFT) and carbamazepine were frequently detected in the water samples, which is indicative of extensive wastewater intrusion impacting the surface water. Estrone (E1), 17-beta-estradiol (E2), and 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) levels found in surface water raises concern of potential endocrine disruption effects in the aquatic ecosystem. Hazard quotient has been calculated to identify areas with high ecological risks to aquatic organisms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds are taken up and accumulate in crops irrigated with treated wastewater. This raises the concern of chronic human exposure to pharmaceuticals via food consumption. Thus, there is a need to develop a reliable technique to detect and quantify pharmaceuticals at environmentally relevant concentrations in human biological matrices, particularly urine. In this study, we focus on carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug and recalcitrant compound that is taken up by crops making it an excellent model compound for this study. This paper presents a new analytical technique enabling quantification of trace concentrations of carbamazepine and its metabolites in the urine of individuals who have been environmentally exposed. Sample preparation included extraction with acetonitrile followed by clean-up through mixed-mode ion-exchange cartridges and analysis using LC/MS/MS. This technique, which was validated for a wide range of concentrations (5-2000 ng L-1), exhibits low limits of quantification (3.0-7.2 ng L-1), acceptable recovery levels (70-120%), and low relative standard deviation (<20%). Unlike currently available methods for the analysis of water or treated wastewater that require large volumes (up to 1 L), the new method uses only 10 mL of urine. Moreover, relative to available methods for carbamazepine detection in the urine of individuals who are chronically treated with this drug, the limit of quantification values with our method are six orders of magnitude lower. The newly developed method has been successfully applied for the quantification of carbamazepine and its metabolites in the urine of healthy people exposed to this pharmaceutical through their diet. Our analytical protocol can provide the scientific community and stakeholders with real data for risk assessments and the design of policies ensuring safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation.

AB Although there is increased global environmental concern about emerging organic micropollutants (EOMPs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) and polar pesticides, limited information is available on their occurrence in Africa. This study presents unique data on concentrations and loads of 31 PPCPs and 10 pesticides in four wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) and receiving rivers (flowing through urban centres) in Kenya. The WSPs indicate a high potential to remove pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) with removals by up to >4 orders of magnitude (>99.99% removal), mainly occurring at the facultative stage. However, there are large differences in removal among the different classes, and a shift in the relative PhACs occurrence is observed during wastewater treatment. Whereas the influent is dominated by high-consumption PhACs like anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. paracetamol and ibuprofen, up to 1000 mu g L-1), the most recalcitrant PhACs including mainly antibiotics (e.g. sulfadoxin and sulfamethoxazole) and antiretrovirals (e.g. lamivudine and nevirapine) are largely abundant (up to 100 mu g L-1) in treated effluent.
   Overall, concentrations of EOMPs in the Nzoia Basin rivers are the highest in dry season (except pesticides) and in small tributaries. They are of the same order of magnitude as those measured in the western world, but clearly lower than what we recently measured in the Ngong River, Nairobi region. Based on the specific consumption patterns and recalcitrant behavior, high concentrations (>1000 ng L-1) are observed in the rivers for PPCPs like lamivudine, zidovudine, sulfamethoxazole and methylparaben. Concentration levels of pesticides are in general one order of magnitude lower (<250 ng L-1). Our data suggest a continuous input of EOMPs to the rivers from both point (WSPs) and diffuse (urban centres) sources. To better understand and manage the impact of both sources, EOMP removal mechanisms in WSPs and their attenuation in rivers merit further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The overall aim of the interdisciplinary research project "PharmCycle" is to reduce the contamination of the aquatic environment with antibiotics by developing sustainable antibiotics, improving the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics, and reducing the discharges of antibiotics in the wastewater outlet. An overview of the holistic approach and first results are given.
   Results: The first step is to design sustainable antibiotics, which are effective against target organisms but, after their use, are less toxic, and are rapidly and completely degradable. To develop sustainable antibiotics, two different approaches (subprojects) are applied within PharmCycle: First, a re-design of the existing antibiotics with chemical and in silico methods ("Benign by Design"). Second, sustainable peptide-based antibiotics are produced with biotechnological methods. In the second step, the environmental risk assessment for antibiotics in the framework of the authorization process and for monitoring purposes is improved. There is a lack of data for the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics on the European market. With more transparency of these data, the environmental risk assessment for active substances and for the class of antibiotics can be improved. The aim is to increase the data availability by applying the Aarhus convention and by providing legal access to environmental information. Beside other shortages in the environmental risk assessment required by the European legislation, the effects of antibiotics directly applied in marine aquacultures are not assessed by marine prokaryotic test systems. Therefore, a marine cyanobacteria test was developed, which is more sensitive to selected priority antibiotics than the marine eukaryotic algae test (DIN EN ISO 10253) required by the European Medicines Agency. Marine cyanobacteria are of high importance for the nitrogen cycle and primary production. Moreover, they seem to play an important role with respect to climate change. To reduce the emission of antibiotics used as human pharmaceutical products to the aquatic environment, the third step focusses on the main pathway, the wastewater. Investigations to improve the wastewater treatment of priority antibiotics and sustainable antibiotics are conducted by a combination of methods: activated sludge units, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration systems.
   Conclusions: With the aim of improving the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics and to reduce the emission of antibiotics to the aquatic environment, an interdisciplinary approach is applied which includes the analysis of the German, European, and international law and the development of new legal instruments.

AB Biological aerated filters (BAFs) have high filtration efficiency due to their tolerance of hydraulic and organic shocks are suitable for the treatment of complex and sanitary wastewater. In this study, for the first time, natural media of date kernel from Bam city was used as the BAF reactor media, with a meshing sand filter separated by a standard metal grid from the natural filter section used at the end of the reactor. This can be considered an innovation in the media and filtration. Aeration in the related reactor with 160 cm height was performed bilaterally as up-flow and continuously by nozzles throughout the reactor media. In this work, the actual effluent of the hospital wastewater treatment plant was employed as the inflow wastewater to the reactor, and its organic and inorganic parameters were measured before and after the treatment by the BAF reactor. The backwashing process was also studied in three ways: bottom backwashing (TB), top backwashing (BB), and top and bottom backwashing (TBBS), to determine the amount of water consumed and to achieve the desired result. According to the results obtained in this study, the removal efficiencies of inorganic and microbial contaminants, amoxicillin and azithromycin were obtained as follows: BOD5: 98.48%, COD: 92.42%, NO3- : 99.4%, P: 93.3%, Coliforms: 97%, Color: 42.8%, Turbidity: 95%, Sulphate: 30%, TSS: 98.9%, Amoxicillin: 20% and azithromycin: 13%. In the backwashing process, the amount of water consumed in these three TB, BB, and TBBS methods were obtained 300, 164, and 118 L, respectively, So, TBBS method was selected as the optimal method. Based on the results obtained in this study, it is concluded that the BAF process with natural date kernel has a high efficiency in removing organic and inorganic contaminants from hospital wastewater, also the concentration of most of the effluent parameters was less or in accordance with EPA standard.

AB Three distinct septic systems designed for onsite removal of nitrogen (N) from residential wastewater were installed at the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center (MASSTC) and at homes across Suffolk County (SC), New York. All configurations featured nitrifying sand beds coupled with denitrifying biofilters composed of 1) a lined, saturated sand and woodchip layer, 2) a saturated box filled with woodchips, or 3) an unlined, unsaturated sand and woodchip layer. Total N (TN) in final effluent discharge from the three systems at MASSTC over more than two years were 7.1 +/- 7.8, 4.3 +/- 4.2, and 6.9 +/- 8.4 mg N L-1, respectively representing TN reductions of 83%, 87%, and 84% from influent TN. Systems at MASSTC also removed on average 90.0-99.9% of 10 of 11 organic contaminants in pharmaceutical and personal care products, microbes indicative of pathogens, and biochemical oxygen demand. Over periods up to 16 months from start-up, effluent from three lined, one woodchip box, and three unlined systems in SC averaged 8.3 +/- 9.2, 5.3 +/- 3.7, and 8.7 +/- 4.9 mg-TN L-1 representing removal rates of 90%, 94%, and 88%, respectively. For all systems, wastewater N was effectively nitrified year-round; N removal varied seasonally as denitrification attenuated in winter. Substantial quantities of TN were removed in the sand beds, likely due to denitrification in anoxic micro-zones. While elevated levels of carbon leached from the wood-based biofilters installed at MASSTC during the first 60 days of operation, no substantial decline in dissolved organic carbon or N removal was observed between the first 15 months of operation and the following 12 months. Collectively, the performance of these non-proprietary, passive systems suggest they may be a useful alternative septic system for protection of groundwater from elevated levels of N, organic contaminants, and pathogens.

AB Transformation of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) during wastewater treatments results in the generation of transformation products (TPs), which can be more persistent than parent compounds. Due to reuse of reclaimed wastewater (RWW) for crop irrigation, OMCs and TPs are released in soils being capable to translocate to crops. Furthermore, OMCs are also susceptible to transformation once they reach the soil or crops. The recalcitrant antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) and some of its frequently reported TPs have been found in agricultural systems. However, there is no knowledge about the fate in reuse practices of multiple CBZ TPs that can be formed during wastewater treatment processes. For the first time, this work presents a study of the behavior of CBZ TPs generated after a conventional Ultraviolet-C (UVC) treatment in an agricultural environment. The UVC-treated water was used for the irrigation of lettuces grown under controlled conditions. The latter was compared to the fate of TPs generated in the peat and plant by irrigation with non-treated water containing CBZ. A suspect screening strategy was developed to identify the TPs using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of flight (LC-QTOF-MS). The results revealed the presence of 24 TPs, 22 in UVC-treated water, 11 in peat and 9 in lettuce leaves. 4 of the TPs identified in peat (iminostilbene, TP 271B, TP 285A-B): and 3 in leaves (10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine, TP 271A-B) were not previously reported in soils or edible parts of crops, respectively. Comparing the TPs found in peat and lettuces derived from both irrigation conditions, no significant differences regarding TPs formation or occurrence were observed. UVC treatment did not contribute to the formation of different TPs than those generated by transformation or metabolism of CBZ in peat or plant material. This research improves the current knowledge on the fate of CBZ TN in agricultural systems because of reuse practices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) released into the environment via discharge of wastewater effluents have been detected in rivers and lakes worldwide, raising concerns due to their potential persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation. This study provides the first reconnaissance of TOrC occurrence in wastewater effluents within Saudi Arabia. Four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs 1-4) located in Western Saudi Arabia were sampled hourly over twelve-hour periods, for a total of six sampling events. All samples were analyzed for a wide range of TOrC encompassing pharmaceuticals, personal care products and household chemicals. Treatment and capacities of the plants varied from non-nitrifying to full biological nutrient removal providing a representative cross section of different types of plants operational within the country. A comparison of TOrC occurrence in effluents in Saudi Arabia with respective effluent qualities in the United States revealed similar levels for most TOrC. Overall, the occurrence of TOrC was higher at two of the plants. The higher TOrC concentrations at WWTP 1 are likely due to the non-nitrifying biological treatment process. The unique TOrC occurrence observed in the WWTP 3 effluent was unlike any other plant and was attributed to the influence of a large number of international visitors in its sewershed. The occurrence of TOrC in this plant was not expected to be representative of the occurrence elsewhere in the country. Bimodal diurnal variation expected for a range of TOrC was not observed, though some hourly variation in TOrC loading was noted for WWTP 3. Since water reclamation and reuse have received increasing interest in Saudi Arabia within the last few years, results from this study provide a good foundation in deciding whether advanced treatment is necessary to attenuate TOrC deemed to be of concern in effluents, or if natural treatment such as managed aquifer recharge provides sufficient protection to public health.

AB Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are one of the treatment technologies with the potential to remove emerging compounds from wastewater. The present work evaluated the efficiency of an MBR pilot system in removing amoxicillin from synthetic wastewater using a continuous flow pre-denitrification MBR (A/O-MBR) pilot unit. The system operated in three phases: (1) synthetic wastewater and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 40 h; (2) adding amoxicillin 100 mu g L-1 to the influent, and (3) varying flowrate to HRT of 20 h. Liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of five amoxicillin degradation by-products in the effluent. The addition of amoxicillin did not affect chemical oxygen demand (COD) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiencies. Respirometry showed that amoxicillin level did not inhibit heterotrophic bacteria metabolism. The change in HRT reduced the DOC removal (from 84% to 66%) but did not influence COD ( > 94%) or total nitrogen (> 72%). The amoxicillin and by-products removal decreased from 80% to 54% with HRT change. Adsorption and biodegradation represented the largest removed fraction of the antibiotic in the A/O-MBR system (68%). Ecotoxicity assays showed P. fluorescens was more resistant and E. coli less resistant to amoxicillin residues at effluent sample matrix.

AB Environmental release and accumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products is a global concern in view of increased awareness of ecotoxicological effects. Adsorbent properties make the biopolymer melanin an interesting alternative to remove micropollutants from water. Recently, tyrosinase-surface-displaying Escherichia coli was shown to be an interesting self-replicating production system for melanin-covered cells for batch-wise absorption of the model pharmaceutical chloroquine. This work explores the suitability of these melanin-covered E. coli for the continuous removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. A continuous-flow membrane bioreactor containing melanized E. coli cells was used for adsorption of chloroquine from the influent until saturation and subsequent regeneration. At a low loading of cells (10 g/L) and high influent concentration of chloroquine (0.1 mM), chloroquine adsorbed until saturation after 26 +/- 2 treated reactor volumes (39 +/- 3 L). The average effluent concentration during the first 20 h was 0.0018 mM, corresponding to 98.2% removal. Up to 140 +/- 6 mg chloroquine bound per gram of cells following mixed homo- and heterogeneous adsorption kinetics. In situ low pH regeneration released all chloroquine without apparent capacity loss over three consecutive cycles. This shows the potential of melanized cells for treatment of conventional wastewater or highly concentrated upstream sources such as hospitals or manufacturing sites.

AB Enhanced coagulation (EC) using ferric chloride was evaluated as a pretreatment process to improve the efficiency of ozone (O-3) for the oxidation of trace organic contaminants in wastewater. At the applied dosages (10-30 mg/L as Fe), EC pretreatment removed between 10 and 47% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the three wastewaters studied. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that EC preferentially removed higher apparent molecular weight (AMW) compounds. Subsequent O-3 testing was performed using an O-3:DOC ratio of 1. Results showed that O-3 exposures were similar even though the required doses were reduced by 10-47% by the EC pretreatment process. Hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) exposure, measured by parachlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), showed 10% reduction when using a FeCl3 dose of 30 mg/L, likely due to the lower O-3 dose and decreased production of HO center dot during the initial phase of O-3 decomposition (t < 30 s). The oxidation of 13 trace organic contaminants (including atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, diclofenac, dilantin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, and trimethoprim) was evaluated after EC and O-3 treatment. EC was ineffective at removing any of the contaminants, while O-3 oxidation reduced the concentration of compounds according to their reaction rate constants with O-3 and HO center dot.

AB The Fenton-like degradation of sulfasalazine solution is studied in this work. The effects of reaction parameters such as Fe3+ concentration, initial H2O2 dosage and the reaction temperature are evaluated. For sulfasalazine of 100 mg/L, the removal of sulfasalazine, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 99.5%, 84.2% and 41% in 60 min with 0.20 mM Fe3+ and 16 mM H2O2 at 35 degrees C, respectively. The complexed Fe3+ presents a reaction constant of 0.062 min(-1) mM(-1) while that of free Fe3+ is 2.526 min(-1) mM(-1) for sulfasalazine degradation. LC-MS technology was used to analysis the possible degradation intermediates. The degradation of sulfasalazine principally begins with the attack of hydroxyl radical on the azo-group as well as the sulfanilamido group. Both intramolecular rearrangement and bimolecular reaction occur simultaneously after the hydroxyl radical attack. Further attack of the active oxidative species results in the cleavage of the aromatic rings and the production of CO2. The degradation of industrial sulfasalazine wastewater with a COD of 3425 mg/L has also been achieved by Fenton reaction with different dosage of H2O2. Relatively better removal efficiency is observed at moderate Fe/H2O2 molar ratio from 1/5 to 2/5 for industrial sulfasalazine wastewater treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water samples were collected from 35 locations in the Arkavathi river, its tributaries and lakes spread across the Bengaluru metropolitan area in Southern India during monsoon (October 2018) and post-monsoon (February 2019) seasons. Eleven pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) (sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, ethyl paraben, diclofenac, propylparaben, ibuprofen, BP-1, oxybenzone, bisphenol A, triclosan, triclocarban) were investigated for their occurrence, seasonal variation, and toxicological effects on the biota. The PPCPs belong to different classes like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antibacterials, UV-filters, plasticizer, and preservatives. Ibuprofen was present in high concentrations (1834 ng/L) followed by triclosan (1761 ng/L) and diclofenac (1130 ng/L) in the river. Samples collected during monsoon season had lower concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and diclofenac whereas rest of the target analytes had lower concentrations during post-monsoon season. Dilution in monsoon season and adsorption to the sediments in the post-monsoon season can be the possible reasons for the seasonal variability. The highest detection frequencies of PPCPs at the Arkavathi river indicates the continuous discharge of wastewater from highly populated metropolitan and industrial areas. The ecotoxicity data for diclofenac and triclosan suggest high risk (Hazard Quotient >1) for various species of fish and algae observed from the Kumbalagodu (S20) and Shanumangala (S19) stations respectively from the mid-stream of Arkavathi river. It was followed by bisphenol A with a hazard quotient of 0.88 in Banashankari (S25) that can affect specific species of fish. No human health risk assessment was estimated from the identified sampling stations. This is the first report on seasonal occurrence of PPCPs with their associated toxicological studies from the Arkavathi river, its tributaries, and lakes across the Bengaluru metropolis.

AB Endangering of the aquatic organisms and humans health by entrance of the pharmaceuticals in hydrosphere is becoming an important growing problem in the world. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered one of the main disposal pathways and incoming load of different pharmaceuticals in hydrosphere. In the present work, a new carrier-mediated hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (CM-HFLPME) based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) was combined with HPLC-UV and applied for determination of ethinylestradiol (EE) and raloxifene (RLX) in pharmaceutical wastewater samples. The target analytes were extracted from 17mL of the basic solution with pH 11 into an organic phase, as the supported liquid membrane (SLM) impregnated in the pores of a hollow fiber, and then back-extracted into the acceptor phase locating into the lumen of the hollow fiber. SLM consisted of n-octanol containing N,N,N-cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), as the carrier, and the acceptor phase contained a mixture of DES and HCl. The important factors including sample pH, extraction time, HCl concentration and CTAB amount were optimized using a central composite design (CCD). Under the optimized conditions, preconcentration factors of RLX and EE were found to be 86 and 53, respectively. The limits of detections (LODs), based on 3S/N, were found to be 5.0ng/mL for RLX and 10ng/mL for EE, respectively. The calibration curves of RLX and EE were linear within the ranges of 20-5000ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9980) and 30-5000ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9985), respectively. Relative standard deviation (RSD%) of RLX and EE, based on three replicates at the concentration of 100ng/mL, was calculated 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method was successfully confirmed by extraction and determination of RLX and EE in pharmaceutical wastewaters.

AB Chemical oxidation processes have been widely applied to water treatment and may serve as a tool to minimize the release of micropollutants (e g pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors) from municipal wastewater effluents into the aquatic environment The potential of several oxidants for the transformation of selected micropollutants such as atenolol, carbamazepine, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole was assessed and compared The oxidants include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ferrate(VI), and ozone as selective oxidants versus hydroxyl radicals as non-selective oxidant. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reaction of each oxidant show that the selective oxidants react only with some electron-rich organic moieties (ERMs), such as phenols, anilines, olefins, and deprotonated-amines in contrast, hydroxyl radicals show a nearly diffusion-controlled reactivity with almost all organic moieties (k > 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) Due to a competition for oxidants between a target micropollutant and wastewater matrix (i e effluent organic matter, EfOM), a higher reaction rate with a target micropollutant does not necessarily translate into more efficient transformation For example, transformation efficiencies of EE2, a phenolic micropollutant, in a selected wastewater effluent at pH 8 varied only within a factor of 7 among the selective oxidants, even though the corresponding k for the reaction of each selective oxidant with EE2 varied over four orders of magnitude in addition, for the selective oxidants, the competition disappears rapidly after the ERMs present in EfOM are consumed In contrast, for hydroxyl radicals, the competition remains practically the same during the entire oxidation Therefore, for a given oxidant dose, the selective oxidants were more efficient than hydroxyl radicals for transforming ERMs-containing micropollutants, while hydroxyl radicals are capable of transforming micropollutants even without ERMs Besides EfOM, ammonia, nitrite, and bromide were found to affect the micropollutant transformation efficiency during chlorine or ozone treatment.

AB In this study, we examined eight typical and widely detected pharmaceuticals (PhAs) removal in an anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge system (five antibiotics: sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enoxacin (ENO), and three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET) and diclofenac (DIC)). The results showed that the SRB sludge had the higher removal efficacy (20 to 90%) for antibiotics (SD, SMX, TMP, CIP and ENO) than NSAIDs (<20%) via adsorption and biodegradation under different operating conditions. Based on a series of batch studies, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (CIP and ENO) were instantly (<15 min) removed (similar to 98%) via adsorption on SRB sludge with adsorption coefficient (K-d) as high as 25.3 +/- 1.8 L/g-suspended solids (SS). And thermodynamics results indicated that the adsorption of CIP and ENO on SRB sludge was spontaneous (Gibbs free energy change (Delta G degrees) <0 kJ/mol), exothermic (enthalpy change (Delta H degrees) <0 kJ/mol), and the adsorption process involved both physisorption and chemisorption (absolute value of Delta H degrees = 20 to 80 kJ/mol). Three widely prescribed antibiotics (SMX, TMP and an) were further investigated for their possible biodegradation pathways along with functional enzymes involved through a series of batch experiments. The biotransformation intermediates indicated that biotransformations of SMX and CIP in SRB sludge system could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase (SR) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, respectively. TMP was likely biotransformed via O-demethylation and N-acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with CYP450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes. This study provided new insight into PhAs removal in SRB sludge system, and has significant potential of implementing sulfur-mediated biological process for the treatment of PhAs containing wastewater.

AB There are over 40,000 chemical compounds registered for use in Australia, and only a handful are monitored in the aquatic receiving environments. Their effects on fish species in Australia are largely unknown. Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were sampled from six river sites in Southeast Queensland identified as at risk from a range of pollutants. The sites selected were downstream of a wastewater treatment plant discharge, a landfill, two agricultural areas, and two sites in undeveloped reaches within or downstream of protected lands (national parks). Vitellogenin analysis, histopathology of liver, kidney and gonads, morphology of the gonopodium, and chemical body burden were measured to characterize fish health. Concentrations of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in water were analyzed by in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis. Estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic, progestagenic and anti-progestagenic activities and TrOCs were detected in multiple water samples. Several active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), industrial compounds, pesticides and other endocrine active compounds were detected in fish carcasses at all sites, ranging from <4-4700 ng/g wet weight, including the two undeveloped sites. While vitellogenin protein was slightly increased in fish from two of the six sites, the presence of micropollutants did not cause overt sexual endocrine disruption in mosquitofish (i.e., no abnormal gonads or gonopodia). A correlation between lipid accumulation in the liver with total body burden warrants further investigation to determine if exposure to low concentrations of TrOCs can affect fish health and increase stress on organs such as the liver and kidneys via other mechanisms, including disruption of non-sexual endocrine axes involved in lipid regulation and metabolism.

AB Pure cultures have been found to degrade pharmaceutical compounds. However, these cultures are rarely characterized kinetically at environmentally relevant concentrations. This study investigated the kinetics of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation by Achromobacter denitrificans strain PR1 at a wide range of concentrations, from ng/L to mg/L, to assess the feasibility of using it for bioaugmentation purposes. Complete removal of SMX occurred for all concentrations tested, i.e., 150 mg/L, 500 A mu g/L, 20 A mu g/L, and 600 ng/L. The reaction rate coefficients (k(bio)) for the strain at the ng/L SMX range were: 63.4 +/- 8.6, 570.1 +/- 15.1 and 414.9 +/- 124.2 L/g center dot day), for tests fed without a supplemental carbon source, with acetate, and with succinate, respectively. These results were significantly higher than the value reported for non-augmented activated sludge (0.41 L/(g center dot day) with hundreds of ng/L of SMX. The simultaneous consumption of an additional carbon source and SMX suggested that the energetic efficiency of the cells, boosted by the presence of biogenic substrates, was important in increasing the SMX degradation rate. The accumulation of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole was observed as the only metabolite, which was found to be non-toxic. SMX inhibited the Vibrio fischeri luminescence after 5 min of contact, with EC50 values of about 53 mg/L. However, this study suggested that the strain PR1 still can degrade SMX up to 150 mg/L. The results of this work demonstrated that SMX degradation kinetics by A. denitrificans PR1 compares favorably with activated sludge and the strain is a potentially interesting organism for bioaugmentation for SMX removal from polluted waters.

AB The occurrence and removal of antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), sulfathiazole (SFI), sulfamethazine (SMA), trimethoprim (TMP), tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC), and enrofloxacin (EFX)) using constructed wetlands (CWs) for treating livestock wastewater were examined. The levels of antibiotics in the effluents of the CWs were in the order of CTC, SFI, SMZ, SMA, TMP, OTC, EFX and TC, ranging from 47.98 to 6834.66 mu g/L, respectively. There was an inverse correlation (p < 0.0493) in the removal of between sulfonamide group (SMZ, SFI, and SMA) and tetracycline group (TC, OTC, and CTC) antibiotics in the effluents of the CWs, indicating that sulfonamide-type antibiotics were more effectively removed in the CWs. Sulfonamide-type antibiotics also have higher pKa values, resulting in more effective adsorption into negatively charged soils through electrostatic interaction. Sunlight photo degradation experiment showed that EFX was effectively removed (70%) compared to other antibiotics. The microcosm adsorption experiment using wetland soils under biotic and abiotic conditions showed that antibiotics in the biotic system were more effectively removed than abiotic system, indicating that soil-mediated microbial degradation can be a major removal mechanism in the CW soils. The microcosm adsorption experiments using wetland plants (Phragmites australis) showed that the biotic system also removed sulfonamide-type antibiotics more effectively compared to the abiotic system. Our results suggest that the removals of antibiotics in the CWs are mainly mediated by biodegradation and adsorption onto soil and plants. Also, the physicochemical property can be the important factors in the removal of antibiotics in the CWs. Our results imply that the CW system can be used for the removal of antibiotics for treating livestock wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The degradation of seven acidic drugs and two metabolites during chlorination was investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A triple-quadrupole (QqQ) system was used to follow the time course of the pharmaceuticals and by-products, while a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) system was also used for the identification of the by-products. Under strong chlorination conditions (10 mg/L Cl-2, 24 h), only four of the target compounds were significantly degraded: salicylic acid, naproxen, diclofenac and indomethacine. The degradation kinetics of these four compounds were investigated at different concentrations of chlorine, bromide and pH by means of a Box-Behnken experimental design. Depending on these factors, measured pseudo-first order half-lives were in the ranges: 23-573 h for salicylic acid, 13-446 min for naproxen, 5-328 min for diclofenac and 0.4-13.4 min for indomethacine. Also, it was observed that chlorine concentration was the overall most significant factor, followed by the bromide concentration (except for indomethacine), resulting in increased degradation kinetics as they are increased. The degradation path of salicylic acid, naproxen and diclofenac consisted of aromatic substitution of one or two hydrogens by chlorine and/or bromide. Moreover, for diclofenac, two other by-products corresponding to a decarboxylation/hydroxylation pathway from the monohalogenated products were also identified. On the other hand, indomethacine degradation did not lead to halogenation products but to oxidation ones. The investigation of these by-products in real samples by LC-MS/MS (QqQ) showed that the halogenated derivates of salicylic acid occurred in all the drinking water and wastewater samples analysed.

AB Micropollutants cover a variety of compounds that mainly originate from the pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors. Even at trace concentrations, the discharge of micropollutants into water bodies pose a serious threat to the environment and human health. Their removal from wastewaters at treatment plants before their discharge into the environment has become one of the leading topics of research. Physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods have been listed in the literature for efficient removal of a variety of pollutants. In this study, seven micropollutants, namely 4-tert-octylphenol, atrazine, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, fluoxetine, estrone, penconazole, and di-n-octyl phthalate, are spiked into municipal simulated synthetic wastewater and treated by a laboratory-scale electrooxidation (EO) system using oxidized titanium and graphite electrode as anode and cathode, respectively. Sensitive determination of the selected micropollutants by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) before and after treatment is performed after their pre-concentration using an eco-friendly switchable solvent liquid-phase microextraction method (SSLPME). The pH value, applied current, and reaction period are optimized to enhance the removal efficiency of micropollutants. Results show that the highest removal efficiency of all micropollutants is obtained at pH 3, 20 min reaction period, and 3 A applied current. The operational costs are also investigated in this study.

AB In this study, a forward osmosis coupled with electrochemical oxidation (FO-EO) process was used to achieve simultaneous rejection and degradation of 15 pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater. The influence of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) on PhACs removal was investigated. Sodium alginate (SA), humic acid (HA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as model organics to represent major constituents of EfOM. Results demonstrated that a generally negative influence of SA on PhACs rejection was observed due to membrane fouling in FO processes. During FO-EO processes, high rejection ( > 95%) and degradation efficiencies ( > 94%) of 15 PhACs were achieved simultaneously. With the presence of model organics in feed, adverse impacts on PhACs degradation were observed in the order of HA > BSA > SA. Results of UV and EEM fluorescence spectroscopy detection verified the competition of EfOM with PhACs for electrochemical oxidation, further proving the role of natural organic matter (NOM) and proteins in impeding the PhACs removal in FO-EO processes. Moreover, degradation products of PhACs were identified. And the acute toxicity of the feed was decreased after treated by FO-EO processes although the mineralization of PhACs was partially achieved. Furthermore, PhACs in actual secondary effluent were well removed by FO-EO processes, exhibiting a desirable application performance.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as hydroxyl radical (HO center dot)- and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-)-mediated oxidation, are alternatives for the attenuation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater effluents. However, the kinetics of these reactions needs to be investigated. In this study, kinetic models for 15 PPCPs were built to predict the degradation of PPCPs in both HO center dot- and SO4 center dot--mediated oxidation. In the UV/H2O2 process, a simplified kinetic model involving only steady state concentrations of HO center dot and its biomolecular reaction rate constants is suitable for predicting the removal of PPCPs, indicating the dominant role of HO center dot in the removal of PPCPs. In the UV/K2S2O8 process, the calculated steady state concentrations of CO3 center dot- and bromine radicals (Br-center dot, Br-2(center dot-) and BrCl center dot-) were 600-fold and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of SO4 center dot-, respectively. The kinetic model, involving both SO4 center dot- and CO3 center dot- as reactive species, was more accurate for predicting the removal of the 9 PPCPs, except for salbutamol and nitroimidazoles. The steric and ionic effects of organic matter toward SO4 center dot- could lead to overestimations of the removal efficiencies of the SO4 center dot--mediated oxidation of nitroimidazoles in wastewater effluents.

AB The paper proposes discussions of some concrete datasets resulted for three solutions of wastewaters management systems applied in case of a Romanian petroleum chemical company. These management options, differing especially in type (centralized or decentralized system) and wastewaters treatment system, were emphasized, mainly by real datasets on treatment performance, polluting species removals, risk of some residuals in treated effluents and natural watercourse nearby, but also environmental impact assessment, using the alternative methodology of global pollution index (I*(Gp)). Interpreting datasets based on in-time analyzed physical-chemical quality indicators and river characteristics, it was estimated the standard quality classification of receiving watercourse as 'medium' (water quality indices, WQI = 55.58 - 67.47), affected more or less by treated effluents discharged in it. The environmental risks of some selected residuals in treated effluents and natural aquatic receptor were assessed by the risk quotient (RQ) which appreciated the risk of residuals toward aquatic life as no to low-medium level, with few exceptions. The impact assessment results conclude an admissible pollution status of natural water receptor due to company wastewaters mechanical-chemical-biological treatment plant activities, in decentralized (I*(Gp) = 1.73) and centralized (I*(Gp) =1.83) system, but generating discomfort effects to aquatic life due to only mechanical-chemical treatment plant operating in decentralized system (I*(Gp) =2.205). Direct discharge of un-treated industrial wastewaters had been interdicted. These real results underline that decentralized systems are reliable, qualitatively efficient and costly effective, offering long-term solution, and that all wastewaters management strategies of petroleum chemical company had been adapted to specific on-site functioning situations.

AB Biological degradation rates of estrogen compounds and common pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were examined in soils with a long history of exposure to these compounds through wastewater effluent and in soil not previously exposed. Biological degradation rates over 14 days were compared under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Estrogen compounds including estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol exhibited rapid degradation by soil microorganisms in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Rapid degradation rates for estrone, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol occurred in pre-exposed soil under aerobic conditions; half-lives calculated under these conditions were 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 day, respectively. Unexposed soil showed similar or slightly longer half-lives than pre-exposed soil under aerobic conditions. The exception was 17 beta-estradiol; in all treatments, degradation in unexposed soil resulted in a shorter half-life (2.1 versus 2.3 days). Anaerobic soils exhibited high biological degradation of estrogens as well. Half-lives of all estrogens ranged from 0.7 to 6.3 days in anaerobic soils. Triclosan degraded faster under aerobic conditions with half-lives of 5.9 and 8.9 days in exposed and unexposed soil. Under anaerobic conditions, triclosan half-lives were 15.3 days in unexposed and 28.8 days in exposed soil. Ibuprofen showed the least propensity toward biological degradation than other chemicals tested. Biological degradation of ibuprofen was only observed in unexposed soil; a half-life of 41.2 days was determined under anaerobic conditions and 121.9 days under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, unexposed soil exhibited a greater ability under anaerobic conditions to biologically degrade tested compounds than previously exposed soil.

AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are emerging environmental pollutants, which, in addition to direct deposition processes, can find their way into surface soils through the agricultural application of sewage sludge and irrigation practices using contaminated wastewater. Therefore, it is important to assess the extent to which soils are able to retain PPCPs and to prevent their downward migration towards groundwaters.
   To further our understanding in this area, batch sorption experiments and artificial rainwater leaching experiments have been performed using five compounds (bezafibrate, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol, diclofenac and triclosan) possessing a range of physicochemical properties in two soils with differing acidities and organic carbon contents.
   The determined K (oc) values for triclosan and diclofenac consistently demonstrated their lower potential mobilities in both soils. The predicted high mobility of chloramphenicol is supported by its efficient leaching potential (89-100 %) in both soils whereas bezafibrate, diclofenac and carbamazepine demonstrate slightly lower affinities for the leachate (61-96 %) for soil A and are strongly retained (> 99 %) by soil B. The amount of PPCP in the leachate, the rate of leaching and the depth of soil penetration are explained in terms of the soil characteristics and the properties of the individual PPCPs (such as solubility and pK(a)) with soil organic content being shown to be a critical factor controlling the ability of a soil to retain a PPCP in the surface layers.
   The findings contribute to the scientific knowledge required by practitioners and regulators as they consider future subsoil contamination by PPCPs and subsequent possible threats to groundwater resources and surface water habitats.

AB In this study, the effect of heavy monsoon rains on the environmental levels of 13 veterinary pharmaceuticals was investigated. Kyungahn Stream has an annual average flow rate (AVF) of 4.2 m(3)/s and receives runoffs from agricultural areas and livestock farms scattered in the upper stream area, and Han River has an AVF of 845 m(3)/s with four sewage treatment plants with individual capacities of >1 million m(3)/day.
   Grab samples collected in three different rain seasons, before, during, and after rain, were analyzed. Kyungahn Stream and Han River showed completely different patterns of environmental levels of pharmaceuticals: the former had higher detection rates and concentrations of the pharmaceuticals during and after rainy season, implying direct influence by rainfalls, whereas in the latter, higher detection rates were observed before rain (1236 ng/L of oxytetracycline (OTC), 2093 ng/L of tetracycline (TC), and 793 ng/L of chiorotetracycline (ChTC) as the highest values).

AB In the present work, low-cost and efficient iron oxide nanoparticle incorporated on mesoporous biochar was prepared from effluent treatment plant (ETP) sludge collected from the textile industry. This sludge contains a higher amount of Fe due to the use of ferric chloride as a coagulant in the treatment of wastewater generated during the process. The raw sludge and prepared biochar was extensively examined by various sophisticated techniques like XRF, XRD, BET, TGA, XPS, RAMAN, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, and VSM. TEM and XRD analysis confirms the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles on mesoporous biochar. The prepared biochar was found to possess BET surface area of 91 m(2) g(-1). Several parameters like pH, dose, initial concentration, temperature and time were optimized for the adsorptive removal of ofloxacin (OFL) from aqueous solution. Biochar (named as BTSFe) achieved approximate to 96% removal efficiency of OFL with a maximum adsorption capacity (q(m)) of 19.74 mg g(-1) at optimum condition. pi-pi electron-donor-acceptor and H bonding were the major mechanisms responsible for the OFL adsorption. Kinetic and equilibrium thermodynamic study of showed that the adsorption of OFL was represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the process was exothermic and spontaneous. Additionally, Redlich-Peterson and Freundlich isotherms best fitted the experimental data indicating multilayer adsorption phenomenon. Biochar was magnetically separated and thermally regenerated after each cycle for five times with a nominal overall decrease of approximate to 8% in removal efficiency. Leaching of iron during the adsorption process was also checked and found to be within the permissible limit. This study provides an alternative application of the textile industry sludge as an efficient, low-cost biochar for the removal of emerging pharmaceutical compounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of human drugs in the aquatic environment is partly due to an incomplete and insufficient removal process of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Thus, drug traces are observed at different concentrations in water bodies, sediments and aquatic plants all over the world. At the same time, Surface Flow Treatment Wetlands (SFTWs) at the outlet of WWTPs are commonly observed in small municipalities as complementary treatment. However, little is known regarding the role of SFTWs in the complementary mitigation of emerging contaminants, such as drugs, and the interactions between drugs, plants and sediment throughout the seasons. For that reason, we conducted sampling sessions over a period of two years on a full-scale SFTW downstream of a vertical-flow constructed wetland. At each session, the SFTW influent and effluent, as well as five different plant species and one composite sediment sample, were sampled. We detected more than fifty pharmaceutical compounds in the inflow and outflow water. The compounds most frequently detected were bisoprolol and ketoprofen. We emphasized that the SFTW removal ability was better in the summer than in the winter, due to the impact of weather on physicochemical parameters. Large variations of removal efficiencies were also observed when considering all of the detected compounds. Large seasonal variations were also observed for each compound. In addition, the study of the five plants showed their ability to uptake drugs from water and soil to the leaves in a species-specific manner. The pharmaceutical composition of the sediment was also correlated with the season: the maximum occurrence was reached in summer, and the minimum was reached in winter. Finally, the continuous decrease in removal efficiencies highlights the ageing effect on SFTW removal ability. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper provides data on the occurrence of selected human pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibrate, fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) including steroid hormones (17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, and estrone) in influents/effluents to/from the four principal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving the city of Rome (Italy), in two different sampling campaigns. Target compounds were also analyzed in the receiving River Tiber and River Aniene. Analytical determination was carried out by LC-MS/MS after sample cleanup and concentration by off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE). The aim of the study was to increase the information currently available on the presence and persistence of pharmaceuticals in Italian urban wastewaters and to evaluate the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical residues discharged through effluents into the receiving rivers. Results indicated that after the treatment processes, most of pharmaceuticals were not completely eliminated, as average removal efficiencies were in the 14-100 % wide range during both sampling periods, with higher yields in spring than in winter. Levels detected in overall samples ranged from 5 to 2,230 ng/L in influents and from 5 to 1,424 ng/L in effluents. Carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil showed the highest persistence to removal. Concentrations in the receiving waters were about one order of magnitude lower than in effluents, with a tendency to increase progressively through the urban tract of the river. Finally, an environmental risk analysis showed that carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and estrone can pose a high risk at the concentrations detected in effluents and a medium risk in rivers, highlighting their potential hazard for the health of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB Endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals represent two classes of emerging contaminants that are ubiquitously present in municipal wastewater effluents. Some of these contaminants have been shown to impact aquatic organisms at trace concentrations (i.e., ng/L). Moreover, the public has expressed human health concerns regarding the presence of emerging contaminants in water reuse projects. The primary objective of this investigation was to determine the efficacy of various membranes and activated carbons for the removal of endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. A suite of structurally diverse target compounds was selected for evaluation based largely upon occurrence and molecular structure. Several membrane types and applications were evaluated at pilot- and/or full-scale, including: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis reversal, membrane bioreactors and combinations of membranes in series. Granular activated carbon was evaluated at bench-scale using rapid small scale column tests and at two full-scale utilities. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration were found to reject very few target compounds; however, some loss of steroidal type compounds was observed. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis were capable of significant rejection of nearly all target compounds, though compounds were detectable at trace levels in permeates. Granular activated carbon was highly effective at removing all target chemicals. However, break-through curves clearly demonstrated that compounds with greater hydrophilicity breach activated carbon faster than hydrophobic compounds. In full-scale applications, the impact of regeneration was observed as activated carbon filters that received regular regeneration had minimal breakthrough of organic contaminants, while non-regenerated filters displayed no removal of target compounds. Findings confirm that membrane and carbon processes are capable of greatly reducing the concentrations of emerging contaminants; however, several compounds are detectable in membrane permeate and carbon effluent.

AB This study reports how adding a membrane filter (0.45-mu m cellulose nitrate filter) between a glass fibre filter and the solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge affected the GC/MS analysis of 48 emerging organic micropollutants in wastewater. Most of them are widely used as active pharmaceuticals, cosmetic and packaging material ingredients including classes of parabens, benzophenones and bisphenols among other chemicals tested. A high artificial organic carbon (OC) content in wastewater (DOC = 280 +/- 14 mg/L) was investigated to gain insight into micropollutants/colloidal OC filter cake interactions. The results show that even with the use of matrix-matched calibration, the introduction of a second (membrane) filtration step can affect the analysis. Both positive, negative and no effects on the theoretical concentrations calculated from the calibration curves with and without additional filtration were observed. Positive effects on the concentration for the same analyte peak area relative to its surrogate standard were the consequence of a reduced signal for the same concentration, while the negative effects are the consequence of increasing signal for the same concentration. Effect types were dependent on the concentration and the nature of the analytes. Results show that bisphenols and parabens significantly interact with colloidal OC. Statistical analysis of molecular descriptor distribution with effect type showed that micropollutants that have a stronger interaction with colloidal OC have significantly higher ability to act as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and have larger molar volume (MV). All compounds that experienced either positive or negative effects have a significantly higher median logD. However, further exploration within a single class of compounds (parabens, benzophenones and bisphenols) revealed that selected descriptors are unrelated to an effect type. Pearson's correlations showed that a correlation exists for certain concentration levels and groups of compounds between a negative effect and MV and logD and a positive effect with MV, MW and rotatable bond (RB) count.

AB The global detection of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in waterbodies and the search for low-cost alternatives to fossil activated carbon have fostered research on the application of modified biochars in complex wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Gasification char - a promising prospect for adsorptive OMP removal - was obtained as by-product in a novel, multi-staged gasification process. The gasification system was designed for medium-scale energy production (530 kW combined heat and electrical power output) from spruce woodchips and relies on a floating-fixed-bed gasifier with a preceding pyrolysis step. The resulting floating-fixed-bed gasification char (FFBC) 'as-is' - i.e. without further modification - and a commercial powdered activated carbon (PAC) were used in adsorption, desorption and kinetic assays with pharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast media, and industrial chemicals, in order to test the suitability of FFBC as OMP adsorbent in different water matrices (spiked water and WWTP effluent). OMP levels were quantified via HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS and Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm fitting was performed. The characterization of FFBC showed a high C-content (91.43%), low ash- content, porous texture (A(BET) = 308.15 m(2) g(-1)), and aromatic, heterogeneous structure (confirmed via FTIR) with basic character (pH = 9.50). For both tested adsorbents, high removal rates > 90% of OMPs with high logD were found at an equivalent dosing of 60 mg l(-1) FFBC approximate to 10 mg l(-1) PAC, whereas X-ray contrast agents exhibited lower affinity. The governing removal mechanisms are hydrophobic and pi-interactions, pore-size effects and - to a limited extent - hydrogen bond formation. Dissolved organic matter in WWTP effluent inhibits OMP adsorption, as observed in decreasing isotherm fitting parameters. The investigated bio-adsorbent - derived from renewable energy, regional supplies, and a process lean in the use of chemicals - could be an inexpensive alternative in adsorptive wastewater treatment.

AB Extensive usage of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and their discharge through domestic sewage have been recently recognized as a new generation environmental concern which deserves more scientific attention over the classical environmental pollutants. The major issues of this type of effluent addressed in this study were its colour, triclosan and anionic surfactant (SDS) content. Samples of cosmetic effluent were collected from different beauty treatment salons and spas in and around Kolkata, India and treated in bioreactors containing a bacterial consortium isolated from activated sludge samples collected from a common effluent treatment plant. Members of the consortium were isolated and identified as Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp. and Comamonas sp. The biotreated effluent was subjected to ultrafiltration (UF) involving indigenously prepared ceramic membranes in both side-stream and submerged mode. Analysis of the MBR treated effluent revealed 99.22%, 98.56% and 99.74% removal of colour, triclosan and surfactant respectively. Investigation of probable acute and chronic cyto-genotoxic potential of the untreated and treated effluents along with their possible participation in triggering oxidative stress was carried out with Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch). Comet formation recorded in both liver and gill cells and micronucleus count in peripheral erythrocytes of individuals exposed to untreated effluent increased with duration of exposure and was significantly higher than those treated with UF permeates which in turn neared control levels. Results of this study revealed successful application of the isolated bacterial consortium in MBR process for efficient detoxification of cosmetic effluent thereby conferring the same suitable for discharge and/or reuse.

AB Climbazole is an antidandruff active ingredient commonly used in personal care products, but little is known about its environmental fate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of climbazole in water, sediment, soil and air compartments of the whole China by using a level III multimedia fugacity model. The usage of climbazole was calculated to be 345 t in the whole China according to the market research data, and after wastewater treatment a total emission of 245 t was discharged into the receiving environment with approximately 93% into the water compartment and 7% into the soil compartment. The developed fugacity model was successfully applied to estimate the contamination levels and mass inventories of climbazole in various environmental compartments of the river basins in China. The predicted environmental concentration ranges of climbazole were: 0.20-367 ng/L in water, and 0.009-25.2 ng/g dry weight in sediment. The highest concentration was mainly found in Haihe River basin and the lowest was in basins of Tibet and Xinjiang regions. The mass inventory of climbazole in the whole China was estimated to be 294 t, with 6.79% in water, 83.7% in sediment, 9.49% in soil, and 0.002% in air. Preliminary risk assessment showed high risks in sediment posed by climbazole in 2 out of 58 basins in China. The medium risks in water and sediment were mostly concentrated in north China. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on the emissions and multimedia fate of climbazole in the river basins of the whole China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Broad scale monitoring of estrogenic compounds was performed at 19 sampling points throughout the Yeongsan and Seomjin river basins and 5 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) adjacent to the Gwangju area, Korea, from December 2005 to August 2007. The concentrations of estrogenic compounds, including estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol-A, nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (OP), in the samples was measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the estrogenic activities throughout the river were investigated using the E-screen assay. Of the six estrogenic chemicals, NP (114.6-336.1 ng L-1) and EE2 (0.23-1.90 ng L-1) were detected at the highest and lowest levels, respectively in both the river waters and the WWTP effluents. Bisphenol-A showed the largest concentration range, from 7.5 to 335 ng L-1. The concentrations of E1, E2 and octylphenol ranges were 3.6-69.1, 1.2-10.7, and 2.2-16.9 ng L-1, respectively. According to the calculated estradiol equivalent concentration (EEQ); however, no estrogenic contribution was observed due to the phenolic compounds in the river waters and effluents. E1 and E2 dominated in both the river water and effluent samples, with contributions to the calculated EEQ of over 79 and 77%, respectively. Conversely, EE2 was rarely detected in the river waters (21%) and effluents (0%). The largest contribution of EE2 to the calculated EEQ was 21% in the river water at S-7. The levels of E1, E2, and EE2 were remarkably decreased in the effluents, indicating that the 5 WWTPs did not contribute to the estrogenic effect of the receiving streams. Overall, the WWTPs did not contributed to the estrogenic activity of the receiving waters, but the livestock industry or wildlife may play an important role in the estrogenic contribution to river water.

AB Artificial recharge to groundwater with reclaimed water is considered a promising method to alleviate groundwater depletion and over-exploitation. However, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) was ubiquitous in wastewater, surface water, groundwater and even drinking water threating human health and ecology. In this study, the occurrence of six selected FQs in reclaimed water effluent and their removal by tertiary treatment units were investigated. The overall removal efficiencies in average of the tertiary treatment processes in Beijing and Changzhou were ranging from 21.2% to 55.2%. Activated carbon exhibited better performance for FQs removal than ozone and biological treatment such as membrane bioreactor, anaerobic-anoxic-oxic and biofilter. The results of two pilot study showed that the impact of reclaimed water to groundwater quality in terms of FQs concentration by direct injection in GBD was stronger than surface spreading in Changzhou, which might be due to the recharge strategy and the physical and chemical characteristics of sediment and aquifer soil. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of ofloxacin (OFL) in reclaimed water was up to 12.54, indicating the extreme eco-toxicological risk, while enrofloxacin (ENR) exhibited medium risk. After recharge with reclaimed water, the HQ values of OFL and ENR in groundwater ranged from low to medium ecological risk to the environment. Thus, the FQs in reclaimed water need to be paid more attention during their reuse for groundwater recharge, especially by direct injection. It is suggested that FQs should be considered in the priority substances lists in standards and guidelines of reclaimed water reuse for groundwater recharge to ensure the safety of groundwater.

AB The objective of the study was to evaluate the sorption of a pool of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) onto a clay-sand filter in a dynamic sorption experiment. The chosen adsorbent should have suitable chemical properties for the removal of the targeted PhACs and also a consistent hydrodynamic behavior regarding field application. In this aim, the impact of interfoliar cations (Ca2+ or Na+) intercalated into natural montmorillonite (Swy2) was tested by using different clay-sand ratios (from 0% to 100% of clay minerals). Only Ca-Swy2 showed a consistent hydraulic conductivity for field application with a value of 4.78 x 10(-8) m s(-1) for a 5%/95% clay-sand ratio. The sorption of PhACs onto this filter was investigated using oedometer cells by varying two parameters: the solution matrix (ultra-pure water or natural effluent) and the injection pressure (0.1 MPa and 0.2 MPa). The PhACs were effectively adsorbed onto the filter for each experiment at different levels. The drop in injection pressure was a favorable factor for sorption whatever the matrix was, with median global removal of similar to 45% at 0.2 MPa and similar to 75% at 0.1 MPa. The effect of the matrix exhibited two different trends as a function of the molecular charge of each PhAC. While cationic compounds were more effectively sorbed in the ultra-pure water matrix than in the effluent matrix, the sorption of anionic PhACs was more effective in the effluent matrix than in ultra-pure water. This indicates that the charge of the pollutant is a key parameter in controlling the efficiency of the adsorbent. Despite these removal variations, the filter exhibited a significant sorption capacity especially at 0.1 MPa. It can therefore be an efficient solution for the removal of PhACs by tertiary filtration.

AB The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in waste sludge, especially for the pharmaceutical waste sludge, presents great potential risks to human health. Although ARGs and factors affecting their spreading are of major importance for human health, the factors influencing the fate of ARGs during sludge treatment, especially for pharmaceutical sludge treatment are not yet well understood. In order to be able to minimize ARGs spreading, it is important to find what is influencing their spreading. Therefore, certain factors, such as the sludge characteristics, bacterial diversity and community composition, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during the advanced AD of pharmaceutical sludge with different pretreatments were studied, and their affinity with ARGs was elucidated by Spearman correlation analysis. Furthermore, multiple linear regression was introduced to evaluate the importance of the various factors. Results showed that 59.7%-88.3% of the variations in individual ARGs and total ARGs can be explained by the corresponding factors. Bacterial diversity rather than specific bacterial community composition affected the fate of ARGs, whereas alkalinity was the most important factor on ARGs among all sludge characteristics investigated in this study. Besides, 66.4% of variation of total ARGs was driven by the changes of MGEs. Multiple linear regression models also reveal the collective effect of these factors on ARGs, and the contributions of each factor impact on ARGs. This study provides more comprehension about the factors impact on the fate of ARGs during pharmaceutical sludge treatment, and offers an approach to evaluate the importance of each factor, which method could be introduced for evaluation of factors influencing ARGs during other types of sludge or wastewater treatment.

AB The removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is variable and some of these compounds pass these plants almost intact and others presenting a removal efficiency close to 100%. Their incomplete removal results in a continuous discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment. To assess the profile of contamination of influents and effluents over a day, a set of 83 pharmaceuticals were evaluated hourly in a WWTP in Leiria, Portugal. The composite samples of the influent and effluent were also collected.
   Concentrations varied from <MDL for ketoprofen, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, and diltiazem to 63.97 mu g/L for caffeine in the WWTP influent composite sample and <MDL for clarithromycin, bupropion, and diltiazem to 2.01 mu g/L for O-desmethylvenlafaxine for effluent composite sample. Concentrations in the range of mu g/L were found for hydroxyibuprolen, salicylic acid, D,L-norephedrine, and caffeine in the WWTP influent, and diclofenac, carbamazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine in the WWTP effluents.
   For the samples collected hourly, thirty-eight and twenty-nine pharmaceuticals were detected in at least one WWTP sample. In the WWTP influent the total concentration of detected pharmaceuticals was higher between 15 and 22 h and lower in the period from 23 to 10 h in the morning. In the WWTP effluent, a slight variation was noticed throughout the sampling hours.
   Carbamazepine, fluoxetine, sertraline, atorvastatin, caffeine, simvastatin, and trazodone were the pharmaceuticals with risk quotient (RQ) >1 in WWIP influents, and carbamazepine, fluoxetine, sertraline the pharmaceuticals with an RQ> 1 in WWTP effluents.

AB Water contamination by the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DCF) is a consequence of its incomplete removal in wastewater and sewage treatment plants, which is potentialized by interactions with other pharmaceutical contaminants. In this context, electron beam irradiation (EBI) has been considered a clean technology for degrading pharmaceutical compounds in water. Nevertheless, the identification of DCF by-products and their correlation with biological recalcitrance and acute toxicity are poorly understood. In this study, the V. fischeri test was used to characterize DCF toxicity in the absence and presence of fluoxetine (FLX), prior and after irradiation. The results showed complete DCF degradation at low dose (5 kGy). DCF concentration followed pseudo first-order decay with respect to the absorbed, with k(0) = (1.33 +/- 0.10) kGy(-1) (DCF) and k(0) = (0.90 +/- 0.12) kGy(-1) (DCF + FLX). In contrast, negligible TOC removal was observed even at 7.5 kGy, with the formation of recalcitrant, non-biodegradable by-products, as also suggested by the respirometry test. Despite that, the toxicity of the DCF solution diminished from (19.6 +/- 1.6) TU to (6.2 +/- 2.3) TU, and from (6.8 +/- 0.9) TU to (3.1 +/- 0.2) TU, in the absence and presence of FLX, respectively, after irradiation up to 5 kGy. Four of the eleven by-products identified by direct-injection MS were easily degraded by EBI, and one (C13H14ClNO5) was considered the least recalcitrant but the most toxic. Based on these results, a possible DCF degradation pathway is proposed, involving hydroxylation and oxidation of aromatic rings, dehalogenation and C - N bond cleavage.

AB Research on decentralized wastewaters deserves special focus due to the potential abundance of emerging organic pollutants including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), which might pose serious threats to the local water bodies and even to human health. Constructed wetland (CW) is a common decentralized wastewater treatment technology, with a certain ability to eliminate PPCPs. Nonetheless, PPCPs removal in common CWs is frequently challenging, besides, the removal mechanism remains elusive. Based on our previous study, tidal flow constructed wetlands (TFCWs) is effective in nitrogen removal. Here, 3 TFCWs with different modifications (baffle, plants, both baffle and plants) were constructed to treat raw domestic sewage and specifically to evaluate the removal efficiencies and mechanism of PPCPs. 24 PPCPs including 7 antibiotics, 8 steroid hormones and 9 biocides were detected in the level of 1.10 +/- 0.29 ng/L-799 +/- 10.6 ng/L in the influents. Consequently, we found that modification with both baffle and plants significantly influenced the removal of PPCPs. Moreover, the highest removal rates of biocides (97.1 +/- 0.29%), steroid hormones (99.8 +/- 0.02%), and antibiotics (90.2 +/- 1.60%) were achieved via both baffles and plants in TFCWs. Based on the mass balance analysis, microbial degradation dominated the removal of PPCPs with a percentage higher than 85.7%, followed by substrate adsorption (5.22 x 10(-2) -14.3%) and plant uptake (1.66 x 10(-3) -0.44%). Further, 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed that the presence of baffle and plants improve the removal efficiency of PPCPs by means of enhancing microbial diversity and changing dominant microorganisms. Moreover, Thaumarchaeota was potentially the key microorganism in the phylum level for PPCPs elimination by TFCWs through LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size) analysis. These findings provide new insights into the removal of PPCPs in CWs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are largely consumed worldwide. As a result, NSAIDs were already found in a variety of environmental aqueous samples, in concentrations ranging from ng/L to mu g/L. This is due to the inability of the currently used technologies in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to completely remove such pollutants/contaminants, thus leading to serious environmental and public health concerns. This work addresses the preparation and application of materials based on silica chemically modified with ionic liquids (SILs) as alternative adsorbents to remove NSAIDs from aqueous media. Modified silica-based materials comprising the 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium cation combined with six anions were prepared, and chemically and morphologically characterized. Adsorption kinetics, diffusion models and isotherms of sodium diclofenac-as one of the most worldwide consumed NSAIDs-were determined at 298 K. The Boyd's film diffusion and Webber's pore diffusion models were used to disclose the rate controlling step affecting the adsorption process. A maximum equilibrium concentration of sodium diclofenac of 0.74 mmol (0.235 g) per g of adsorbent was obtained. Several solvents were tested to remove diclofenac and to regenerate SILs, being the mixture composed of 1-butanol and water (85:15, v:v) identified as the most promising and ecofriendly. After 3 regeneration steps, the material is able to keep up to 75% of its initial adsorption efficiency. Considering the maximum values reported for sodium diclofenac in effluents from WWTPs/STPs, 1 g of the most efficient material is "ideally" able to treat ca. 50,000 L of water. These materials can thus be envisioned as efficient filters to be implemented at domestic environment in countries where the levels of pharmaceuticals are particularly high in drinking water.

AB The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) of the city of Bizerte concentrates different types of chemical and biological pollutants in the Bizerte lagoon (Tunisia). Considering four upstream and downstream WWTP discharge stations, seventy nine, culturable bacterial strains were isolated and identified from water and sediment as fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, pathogenic staphylococci and non-enterobacteriacea. Fecal coliforms were most abundant (2.5 10(5) bacteria/mg) in sediment of WWTP discharge. Leuconostoc spp (23.1%) and Chryseomonasluteola (23.1%) were the most prevalent culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) isolated at the upstream discharge stations. However, Staphylococcus xylosus (13.9%) was the most prevalent culturable FIB isolated at the WWTP discharge stations. Moreover, high antibioticresistance phenotypes were present in all sampling stations, but especially in WWTP discharge station in both water and sediment. Resistance levels in water and sediment, respectively were amoxicillin (58.8%; 34.8%), penicillin (50%; 31.6%), oxacillin (60%; 33.3%), cefotaxim (55.2%; 39.1%), ceftazidim (66.7%; 50%), gentamycin (42.9%; 38.9%), tobramycin (50%; 25%), vancomycin (33.3; 71.4%), amikacin (66.7%; 0%) and ciprofloxacin (100%; 100%). Interestingly, beta-lactam antibiotic resistant FIB were mostly isolated from water as well as from sediments of upstream and WWTP discharge station. Canonical correspondence analysis CCA correlating antibiotic resistance profile with the abiotic data showed that, in water column, culturable bacterial strains isolated in upstream WWTP discharge stations were interestingly correlated with the resistance to amikacin, oxacillin, cefotaxim, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin, however, in sediment, they were correlated with the resistance to amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefotaxim and vancomycin. Serious beta-lactams and aminoglycosides acquired resistance appeared mainly in fecal strepto-cocci and pathogen staphylococci groups.

AB As far as we know, the electrochemical degradation of simvastatin, a widely used as a cholesterol lowering drug, has not been reported yet. The oxidation process has been investigated in pure water and wastewater using graphite-Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) composite electrode as anode. Effects of initial concentration of simvastatin, NaCl loading, type of sample and applied voltage were tested to evaluate the electrochemical oxidation process. The results revealed that the electrochemical oxidation rates of simvastatin followed pseudo first-order kinetics, with rate constant values ranged from 0.006-0.23 min (1) depending on the operating parameters. Simvastatin was completely removed, after 40 min of treatment, at 4 g/L NaCl and 10 V indicating high concentration of OCl produced in the solution but at the same time energy consumption (EC) was very high. However, 6 V was selected for further experiments (90% removal and 0.093 Wh/mg energy consumption) after 40 min. The low concentration of simvastatin (30 mg/L) exhibited better removal of 97% compared to 50 mg/L which gives removal 90% after 40 min. In this work the electrochemical oxidation process of simvastatin has been studied by monitoring the by-products and their toxicity using the time-of-flight (TOF/MS) technology. Chlorinated by-products were separated and identified accurately using isotope modern software. Simvastatin was transformed within 20-80 min, however, after 100 min most of by-products have been removed. Eleven new by-products of simvastatin were identified and monitored in both positive and negative ionization mode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years ever-increasing amounts of pharmaceuticals are being detected in the aquatic environment and in some cases, they have even been discovered in drinking water. Their presence is attributed mainly to the inability of sewage treatment plants to adequately remove these compounds from the sewage influent. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, kinetics and efficiency of using liquid-core microcapsules as a novel methodology, termed capsular perstraction, to remove seven pharmaceuticals commonly found in the environment, from water. The process involves the envelopment of pre-selected organic solvents within a porous hydrogel membrane to form liquid-core microcapsules, which can be used to extract a large range of compounds. Results indicate that this novel approach is capable of extracting the seven chosen compounds rapidly and with a variable efficiency. The simultaneous use of both dibutyl sebacate and oleic acid liquid-core microcapsules at a liquid volume ratio of only 4% (v/v) resulted in the following extractions within 50 mm of capsule addition to contaminated water: furosemide 15%; clofibric acid 19%; sulfamethoxazole 22%; carbamazepine 54%; warfarin 80%; metoprolol 90% and diclofenac 100%. The effects of different agitation rates, microcapsule size and membrane thickness on the rate of mass transfer of warfarin into the liquid-core (dibutyl sebacate) of microcapsules was also examined. Results showed that the main rate-limiting step to mass transfer was due to the stagnant organic film (microcapsule size) within the core of the microcapsules. A volumetric mass transfer coefficient of 2.28 x 10(-6) m/s was obtained for the smallest microcapsules, which was nearly 4-fold higher compared to the value (0.6 x 10(-6) m/s) obtained for the largest microcapsules used in this study. Even with this resistance liquid-core microcapsules are still capable of the rapid extraction of the tested compounds and may provide a platform for the safe disposal of the pharmaceuticals after removal.

AB A membrane bioreactor (MBR) was assessed for the removal of estrogens, androgens, and a selection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The biomass and aqueous components of the MBR were investigated to determine whether removal was by biodegradation or by adsorption to the biomass. Removal was monitored using chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as well as biological analysis using estrogenic and androgenic yeast assays. Results showed that the MBR was effective in removing the compounds of concern from raw influent with removal rates between 78 and 99%. Removal efficiencies were comparable or better than those reported for conventional activated sludge systems, which was attributed to the relatively high sludge retention time of the MBR. The biomass component showed significant concentrations of salicylic acid, triclosan, and 4-tert-octylphenol. Estrogenic and androgenic activity was also measured in the biomass. Estrone was identified as the main compound responsible for the estrogenic activity. It was concluded that the main removal pathway was biodegradation, but sorption to biomass may also be important, particularly for triclosan and 4-tert-octylphenol.

AB Artificial recharge to groundwater with reclaimed water is considered a promising method to alleviate groundwater depletion and over-exploitation. However, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) was ubiquitous in wastewater, surface water, groundwater and even drinking water threating human health and ecology. In this study, the occurrence of six selected FQs in reclaimed water effluent and their removal by tertiary treatment units were investigated. The overall removal efficiencies in average of the tertiary treatment processes in Beijing and Changzhou were ranging from 21.2% to 55.2%. Activated carbon exhibited better performance for FQs removal than ozone and biological treatment such as membrane bioreactor, anaerobic-anoxic-oxic and biofilter. The results of two pilot study showed that the impact of reclaimed water to groundwater quality in terms of FQs concentration by direct injection in GBD was stronger than surface spreading in Changzhou, which might be due to the recharge strategy and the physical and chemical characteristics of sediment and aquifer soil. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of ofloxacin (OFL) in reclaimed water was up to 12.54, indicating the extreme eco-toxicological risk, while enrofloxacin (ENR) exhibited medium risk. After recharge with reclaimed water, the HQ values of OFL and ENR in groundwater ranged from low to medium ecological risk to the environment. Thus, the FQs in reclaimed water need to be paid more attention during their reuse for groundwater recharge, especially by direct injection. It is suggested that FQs should be considered in the priority substances lists in standards and guidelines of reclaimed water reuse for groundwater recharge to ensure the safety of groundwater.

AB Bisphenol (BP) analogues are widely used as industrial materials and various product additives and are inevitably released into environment. However, knowledge on the sources of different BPs, especially those from urban rainfall runoff to the receiving rivers is very limited. In this study, 15 BPs were determined in surface water, sediments, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and rainfall runoff samples in the Pearl River region, South China. Eleven BPs were detected in surface water and sediments of the Pearl Rivers. BPA was the dominant compound up to 2080 ng/L in surface and 1970 ng/g in sediments, followed by BPF, BPS, BPTMC and BPAF. In WWTPs, 10, 9 and 8 BPs were detected in influents, effluents and excess sludges, respectively, with total BPs (Sigma BPs) concentrations in effluents still at thousands ng/L, suggesting incompletely removal of BPs. Five BPs were detected in urban rainfall runoff samples, with the Sigma BPs concentrations up to 7740 ng/L. Mass loads of Sigma BPs from the rainfall runoff (5800 kg/y) were almost equivalent to the source from WWTPs (7370 kg/y) in the region, implying that the urban rainfall runoff was a potential source for BPs into the receiving river. The calculated estrogenic activity contributed by BPs showed low to median risks in sources and receiving rivers. But BPs are always as mixtures with other potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which probably pose high estrogenic activity risks. Hence, effective measures should be taken to decrease the input of EDCs from sources to receiving rivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals are found in both receiving and drinking water due to their persistent release in wastewater effluents, raising concerns for environmental and human health. Chronic, aqueous exposure of zebrafish (Danio redo) to environmentally relevant concentrations of acetaminophen (ACE), venlafaxaine (VEN) (10 mu g L-1), carbamazepine (CBZ) and gemfibrozil (GEM) (0.5 and 10 mu g L-1) decreased reproductive output. Atretic oocytes and altered ovarian histology were seen in female zebrafish exposed to CBZ and GEM, suggesting a direct effect on oocyte development that may account for the reduced fecundity. Apoptosis within the theca and granulosa cells was identified in exposed female zebrafish with atretic oocytes by TUNEL positive staining. The incidence of follicular apoptosis was nearly 2-fold higher in exposed females than the controls. All compounds significantly altered kidney proximal tubule morphology but there was no difference in the incidence of apoptotic cells within the kidney between control and exposed in either males or females. Liver histology was altered by ACE and GEM exposure. Parental exposure to pharmaceuticals did not increase developmental abnormalities, hatching success, or mortality in embryos. Yet, direct exposure of embryos to ACE increased developmental abnormalities and mortality; exposure to 0.5 mu g L-1 of all pharmaceuticals increased mortality. CBZ decreased plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentrations in males and females. Overall, these data suggest that low concentration, chronic exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals impacts fish development as well as multiple organ systems in adult fish, leading to effects on reproduction and histology of liver and kidney. These results are significant in understanding the consequences of chronic, low concentration pharmaceutical exposure to fish and suggest that exposed populations are at risk of negative impacts to reproduction and health.

AB The occurrence and fate of 12 commonly used antibiotics, two fluoroquinolones (FQs), three sulfonamides (SAs), three macrolides (MLs), two beta-lactams and two tetracyclines (TCs), were studied in four sewage treatment plants (STPs) and their receiving water, the Huangpu River, Shanghai. The levels of selected antibiotics in the STPs ranged from ng L-1 to mu g L-1, while ofloxacin (OFL) was predominant (reach up to 2936.94 ng L-1). The highest and lowest proportions were of FQs (STP 1, STP 2 and STP 3) and TCs (in four STPs) respectively in both influents and effluents. And the second-highest proportion was of FQs in STP 4 (only 2% lower than the highest). What could be inferred was that the usage of TCs were extremely low while the usage of FQs were larger than other antibiotics in our study area. The elimination of antibiotics through these STPs was incomplete and a wide range of removal efficiencies (-442.8% to 100%) during the treatment was observed. Based on the mass loadings as well as the per capita mass loadings of target antibiotics in four STPs, OFL was considered the primary contaminant herein. In the Huangpu River, 3 antibiotics were not detected in any water samples, while the detection frequencies of 4 antibiotics were 100%. The highest concentration detected in the river was 53.91 ng L-1 of sulfapyridine (SD). The Spearman correlation analysis of antibiotics in STPs and the nearby water samples suggests that the antibiotics discharged from some STPs might influence the receiving water to some extent. Moreover, most of the hazard quotient (HQ) values in STP effluents were one order magnitude higher than those in their receiving water. However, there is no imminent significant ecotoxicological risk caused by any single compound in the effluents and receiving waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Many rivers in urbanised catchments in South Africa are polluted by raw sewage and effluent to an extent that their ecological function has been severely impaired. The Hennops and Jukskei Rivers lying in the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment are two of the worst impacted rivers in South Africa and are in need of rehabilitation. Passive sampling (Chemcatcher (R) with a HLB receiving phase) together with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry-targeted screening was used to provide high sensitivity and selectivity for the identification of a wide range of emerging pollutants in these urban waters. Over 200 compounds, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, drugs of abuse and their metabolites were identified. Many substances (similar to 180) being detected for the first time in surface water in South Africa. General medicines and psychotropic drugs were the two most frequently detected groups in the catchment. These accounted for 49% of the emerging pollutants found. Of the general medicines, antihypertensive agents, beta-blocking and cardiac drugs were the most abundant (28%) classes detected. The Hennops site, downstream of a dysfunctional wastewater treatment plant, was the most polluted with 123 substances detected. From the compounds detected, peak intensity-based prioritisation was used to identify the five most abundant pollutants, being in the order caffeine > lopinavir > sulfamethoxazole > cotinine > trimethoprim. This work provides the largest available high-quality dataset of emerging pollutants detected in South African urban waters. The data generated in this study provides a solid foundation for subsequent work to further characterise (suspect screening) and quantify (target analysis) these substances.

AB This study proposes a microwave-assisted method for the simultaneous extraction of highly prescribed antidepressants (citalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline and amitriptyline) and caffeine from sediments and sewage sludge for subsequent HPLC-PDA analysis. Because the sludge and sediment matrices have high contents of organic material, they strongly interact with the analytes and hinder extraction. Thus, a carefully optimised analytical methodology is required for quantitative extraction. A simplex-centroid design was applied to optimise the solvent composition, and a three-factor central composite rotational design was used to optimise the extraction protocol with regards to pH, amount of solvent and processing time. Samples (in triplicates) were fortified with a standard mixed solution of all the analytes and extracted according to the experimental design in each study. The extraction steps included: 30s vortexing, 20s microwave heating at 10W, cooling to room temperature (25 degrees C) in an ultrasonic bath for 60s, 2min centrifugation at 2000 rpm, and filtration. Analysis of variance and lack-of-fit tests were used to assess the significance of data fitting at 95% confidence. The desirability function was the optimisation tool used to obtain the ideal extraction conditions. As a result, a binary mixture of methanol and acetonitrile in 45:55 and 53:47 (v/v) ratios was indicated as the optimum solvent composition for the simultaneous extraction of all the target drugs from the sludge and sediment, respectively. The optimised extraction conditions were: 3 extraction cycles with 4mL of solvent at pH 3 for sewage sludge extraction and 4 extraction cycles with 3mL of solvent at pH 11 for sediment extraction. Further, low recoveries were obtained for extractions from sediment as compared to sludge indicating strong interaction of antidepressants and caffeine with the acidic organic components of sediments. It was found that the optimisation of pH of the extraction phase was crucial for the efficient extraction of the analytes from these environmental matrices.

AB The cosmopolitan species-complex Capitella, a deposit-feeding polychaete, is widely used as an indicator of organic pollution and plays an important role in sewage waste cycling in marine and estuarine ecosystems. The antidepressant fluoxetine can be accumulated in sewage effluents and it could pose a hazard to infauna inhabiting surrounding areas. The study aimed to assess effects of fluoxetine on juveniles and adults of Capitella teleta and Capitella sp A. Sediments were spiked with four fluoxetine concentrations (0.001, 0.03, 0.3 and 3.3 A mu g/g dry wt. sediment). Chronically exposed worms of C. teleta showed delay of maturity, delay or inhibition of copulation and morphological abnormalities (genital spines in males and juveniles) with adverse physiological consequences. Alternatively, in C. teleta fluoxetine enhanced proteroginous individuals that may be beneficial for the population. Worms of Capitella sp A only showed delay or inhibition of copulation. Observed fluoxetine adverse effects could have important ecological implications in natural populations of aquatic invertebrates due to the possible alteration or even inhibition of reproductive processes.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have been universally detected in rivers, lakes and coastal waters that are affected by effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, the biological effects and bioaccumulation of PhACs were assessed in crucian carp (Carassius auratus) caged in an effluent-receiving river for 21 days. Compared with control fish in the laboratory and at a reference site, a significant reduction in hepatosomatic index (HSI) and increase in the biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were observed in the fish that was caged downstream from the STP outfall. In general, the total concentrations of PhACs detected in fish tissues were in the order as follows: liver > brain > gill > muscle > bile. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for PhACs were between 195 and 2782 in the major storage tissue liver. The corresponding results for both risk quotient (RQ) and enhanced integrated biomarker response (EIBR) based on laboratory and field studies, respectively, indicated that environmental risk for adverse effects to aquatic organisms were clearly higher at the downstream of the STP outfall than at the upstream.

AB A sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the determination of carbamazepine in microgram quantities of crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus and the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at the ng L(-1) level. This fully validated method applied to a bio-accumulation study was found suitable for the detection of carbamazepine in small aquatic tissues.

AB Despite the increasing interest for pharmaceuticals in the marine environment, their accumulation in wild or-ganisms and consequent environmental hazards are still poorly known. The Mediterranean Sea is highly challenged by the density of coastal populations, large consumption of pharmaceuticals and their often limited removal by Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs). In this respect, the present study aims to provide the first large-scale survey on the distribution of such contaminants of emerging concern in native mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis from Italian coasts. Organisms were collected from 14 sites representative of relatively unpolluted marine waters along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Sea and analysed for 9 common pharmaceuticals including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs: Diclofenac DIC, Ibuprofen IBU, Ketoprofen KET and Nimesulide NIM), the analgesic Acetaminophen AMP, the antiepileptic Carbamazepine CBZ, the antihypertensive Valsartan VAL, the anxiolytic Lormetazepam LOR and the antidepressant Paroxetine PAR. Results indicated the widespread occurrence of the majority of pharmaceuticals in mussel tissues: CBZ was measured in >90% of analysed samples, followed by VAL (>50%), PAR (>40%), and DIC (>30%), while only AMP and KET were never detected. Heterogeneous tissue concentrations ranged from a few units up to hundreds of ng/g (d.w.), while seasonal and interannual variability, investigated over 4 years, did not highlight any clear temporal trend. Limited differences obtained between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Sea, as well as coastal versus off-shore sampling sites, suggest that analysed levels of pharmaceuticals in mussels tissues should be considered as baseline concentrations for organisms collected in unpolluted areas of the Mediterranean. This study provided the first unambiguous evidence of the widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals in marine mussels from Italian coasts, giving novel insights on the potential ecotoxicological hazard from such compounds in marine species.

AB In this study, the concentrations of nine typical antibiotics, including sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamethazine (SM2), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), ofloxacin (OFX), ciprofloxacin (CIP), trimethoprim (TMP), oxytetracycline (OTC), and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), were detected in the Yitong River by solid-phase extraction high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of the antibiotics were analyzed. Additionally, an improved immobilized substrate enzyme substrate method (DST-enzyme substrate method) was developed and used to evaluate the antibiotic resistance of coliform bacteria to OFX, CIP, enrofloxacin (ENR), TC, sulfisoxazole (SOX), and TMP in the Yitong River. The results showed that the concentrations of the nine antibiotics ranged from nd (not detected) to 1.361 mu g/L. The detection rate and concentration of OFX were the highest, followed by CIP, and the detection rate and concentration of SM2 and OTC were the lowest. The detection rate and concentrations of antibiotics were higher in August and November than those in May. The antibiotics were mainly distributed in the livestock sewage discharge and suburban domestic sewage discharge areas. Moreover, the drug resistance of total coliform bacteria to fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and TMP varied with season.
